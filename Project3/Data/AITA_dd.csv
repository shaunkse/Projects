0,AmItheAsshole,"Hello everyone! We’re starting this new year off with a bang with some big improvements. We’ve been listening to your feedback and our New Year’s resolution is to act on it. Please read this entire thread as it contains a LOT of information—some of which may surprise you.

[We recently asked you how you felt about a rule that your moderation team has always struggled with.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e9ohuh/lets_have_a_dialogue_about_rule_8_no_humblebrags/)

Well, we were very pleased to discover that you guys more or less feel the same way about the rule as we do. The general consensus of the META thread was that this rule was too subjective to enforce fairly, and the frequent removals impeded your ability to read the subreddit and participate in discussions.

So, as of today, **we no longer have a rule against “validation” posts.**

In order to eliminate this rule, the mod team has worked on writing an expanded set of policies to address some of the potential issues that will come with taking this step forward. We’ve also created /r/AITAFiltered, a subreddit that crossposts the most controversial AITA posts for your viewing (and judging) pleasure for those of you that hate seeing one-sided posts rise to the top.

For the next few weeks, we may find some difficulty adapting to the change in moderation. Please have patience with us during this time. 

We hope you’ll all be happy with this result.

#Bigger Rule Changes

We've divided Rule 7 into two parts using the space left by the removal of old Rule 8 (validation). The new Rule 8 bars shitposting and false stories, and Rule 7 now focuses solely on what posts belong here—interpersonal conflicts. We hope that this division will make violations easier to both understand and report.

[Here is a link to an archive of the old version of the rules to help you understand what has changed.](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218194734/https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index)

We’ve created two new rules to address some of the issues that we’ve removed as validation in the past. Rules 12 and 13 are new, but are restrictions we already enforce—all we’re doing is making them easier to report through giving them their own spaces in the rules. 

Rule 12 prohibits debate bait and Rule 13 prohibits stories about revenge.

**Please read the new ruleset in the sidebar and familiarize yourself with the new report options.**

If that link doesn't work and directs you to some r/askreddit question for some reason: I have no idea why this error is occurring, contact the creator of your app. 

#""Expanded Rulebook""

Putting these rules in place has removed our need for an ""expanded rulebook""—an annoying document that none of you were ever interested in reading and none of us were ever interested in maintaining. The rules should now be much easier to understand for all of us. As a result, the “expanded rulebook” is no longer necessary, and the link has been removed—but some of its content has migrated to our FAQ.

#/r/AITAFiltered

Many of the users in the meta thread who wanted to keep rule 8 said something to the effect of “I like to read through the posts here for fun, but I don’t like reading validation posts.” This new subreddit is intended to be a list of all of the “good” threads to read through—threads where the outcome isn’t obvious. Want to page through the toughest AITA scenarios and see what our community has to say about them? /r/AITAFiltered has your back. 

It’s not a “Best Of” subreddit so much as a “Most Controversial” subreddit. Comments will not be open on the filtered subreddit—it is simply meant to guide readers to more interesting posts. We won’t be opening the comment sections there as we’d end up moderating the same threads twice.

Posts are crossposted by a bot to /r/AITAFiltered when:

- The post is 18 hours old—the time at which posts on this sub are given their flair with the final judgment.

- The post has at least 50 top level (judgment) comments.

- The majority judgment is under 70% of total judgments in the thread. The votes are split at least 70/30—potentially as split as 50/50.

- For the sake of simplicity- ESH/YTA are grouped together as are NAH/NTA.
We will **not** flair the posts on this subreddit with the judgment in an attempt to appease those of you who consider our flairs to be “spoilers.”

The  judgment bot will comment on each post in /r/AITAFiltered with a breakdown of the judgments used in top level comments.

If you are someone who is only interested in these split decisions, please feel free to unsubscribe from /r/amitheasshole and instead subscribe to /r/AITAFiltered to find content you may be more interested in reading. 

**YTA for needing validation**

In order for the bot to correctly assess threads for use in /r/aitafiltered, automod will remove any comments that present a YTA judgment on the basis of the post being a “validation” post. 

Similarly, automod will also remove “YTA for shitposting,” and you will instead be prompted to use the report button rather than feed the troll. Trolls like responses. Even if your response is to tell the troll that it is a troll, the troll has won by gaining your attention. 

#Smaller Rule Changes

**Relationship Posts and Cheating**

We’ve edited Rule 11 to contain the phrase “And any discussions related to cheating—including ""telling on"" someone for cheating (or not doing so).”

We will no longer allow any discussions related to cheating in relationships. Reddit predictably doesn’t like cheaters and struggles to follow Rule 5: “No Violence” when discussing cheating, so we will no longer be hosting those conversations here.

**BE CIVIL**

In an attempt to make Rule 1: “Be Civil” easier to understand, we have adjusted the way we have worded it almost entirely. We will not be enforcing this rule any differently than we already do as its intent remains the same.

2,AmItheAsshole,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ehmsme/aita_for_letting_my_brother_call_me_dad_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Hey guys! So many people wanted me to update on my previous post and wanted me to seek professional advice first before I take matters into my own hands. Apologies if it is long. I'll try to make it as detailed as possible while making this short.

I went to my local therapist and told him about my situation and asked what to do. To keep it short, he said he's heard similar recounts from before and said it is best if I tell him as soon as possible for multiple reasons and to **make sure that my bio-children are present** (multiple reasons). I asked a few of my closest friends and the majority said more or less the same thing.

My wife and I decided to sit the kids down and burst the big bubble. I asked my brother Josh to come closer and I made sure I held him close and make him feel comfortable. He asked ""What's going on?"" but I started by telling us how much we cared and loved for him, then told him everything about my parents (I put them in a bright light in hopes of a reunion) and who I am to him, then quickly hugged him and my other two kids together and told him that I love all my children the same and NOTHING is going to change my love for him. He was shocked and asked if I was joking, but I was starting to cry a little at this point, so he knew I was serious. My bio-children were very surprised too. He was in tears and asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. I didn't know what to say and said ""I was just trying to protect you, I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me"", but unfortunately and understandably, he left.

He didn't talk to me as much, again, understandably so. I continuously offered him to go out to the park and play a bit of football (he loves that) and all his favourite things, but he just outright declined and even got a little angry sometimes for me even talking to him. I thought I messed up big-time, until one day while my wife and two children were out doing shopping and we were alone, he came up to me and said ""I know you're not my real father, but I want to let you know you're the best dad in the whole world. Sorry for before."" I hugged him and things got pretty emotional. It would be a big lie to say my house is normal now (far from that), but things are slowly - ever so slowly - starting to brighten up. There's no longer anything to hide anymore and it feels like we are born again.

Josh is a tough kid, and he handled this far better than I believed he would. I'll be looking into therapy for him to help him recover just incase it doesn't go well in the long run. I'll strive and continue to be a great dad to my kids, and a great dad to my brother/son. Thank you Reddit for pushing me towards this happy ending. Thank you for all the advice and judgements I got (excluding the rude ones about my uncles and aunts -- eeek!) I love you all. Good night.","UPDATE: AITA for letting my brother call me ""dad"" and refusing to tell him the ugly truth?"
3,AmItheAsshole,"After discussing the idea of having my adult son move in with me and my long time boyfriend, also male here, she questioned whether I was concerned if my BF was going to try to sleep with my son. I immediately called her a sick fuck and asked what the hell was wrong with her and ended the session.  The next day I told her I needed some time to determine if I could continue to see her because I was so bothered by her previous comment.  She responded by saying I couldn't take a joke and I needed to ""look into myself"" to figure out why I was so upset.  I refuse to see her again. AITA?",AITA for telling my therapist to F off?
4,AmItheAsshole,"I realize this title makes me sound like a complete douche but I’m at my wits end. Obligatory apologies for mobile.

I am getting married in one week. My sister has a son who is 7 and on the spectrum. We’ll call him Josh. We asked to have him be a ring bearer months ago, they both agreed, everything is happy. 

Fast forward to today and my sister calls me. Apparently, Josh has taken to wearing a Spider-Man costume and will not take it off. It’s been weeks and he throws an absolute fit when asked to wear anything else. It’s to the point where he’s even wearing it to school because the parents have completely given up. My sister calls me to give me a “heads up” that Josh will be wearing his costume to my wedding.

I tell her absolutely not. I don’t care if he wears it during the reception, but I do not want Spider-Man walking down the aisle at my wedding and in all my photos. My sister gets indignant, tells me “Then you don’t want Josh at your wedding” because she cannot get him to wear anything else without a tantrum ensuing. I said if she cannot get him into something at least semi-formal, she can make arrangements for him to have a babysitter during the ceremony. 

She huffed at me and told me I was being a complete Bridezilla and “banning an autistic child from my wedding.” I’m not “banning” him, I’m just insisting he wear normal clothes. She comes back, telling me I was essentially banning him because of his autism. 

My fiancé is backing me up but my sister and her husband are now threatening to not come to the wedding at all. I have no idea what to do. AITA?",WIBTA for banning an autistic child from my wedding?
5,AmItheAsshole,"
So back in late November, myself and a few others from my company were invited to an international conference in Madrid. There was approximately 150 attendees, and rooms would be shared girl-girl boy-boy. We were told not to expect that we would be sharing with someone from our office. 

When we get to the hotel, I’m given my room key and told my roommate has already checked in. 
After the conference, I head up to my room to change as the company had booked a club for everyone to go and party. When I get into my room I’m surprised to see a guy in there, and it turns out as we both have fairly unisex names, they put us together. 

I essentially laugh it off, he asks if I’ll be going out to the club, and says he’ll be coming back quite late, I say that’s fine as that’s my plan too. 

At this point my boss calls me to see how things are going, I tell him the situation and he says I should contact the hotel immediately to sort it out. I tell him I don’t really mind. The guy seemed alright and was close to my age, it was only for one night anyway. 

I head out to the party and enjoy myself for a while, but I was really tired and decided to head back to the hotel a bit earlier than I had planned. I get changed and get into bed. 

At around 4:00am, I feel a tap on my shoulder and wake up to see FOUR GUYS crowded around my bed, one of them starts talking to me about where I’m from. I notice that my roommate is at the door of the room with a few girls and has let these guys in. 
I’m obviously pretty freaked out, I tell them to let me sleep and they head back towards the door. I hear one of them say “what the fuck is she doing in this room anyway”. 
From that point onwards, my roommate did not close the hotel room door, people kept coming in and out and trying to speak to me throughout the night. 
I didn’t do much about it other than cover my head with the duvet because frankly I was intimidated and embarrassed, and at some point in the early morning they all piss off. 

As soon as the room is clear I check out the hotel and leave. 

When I get back to London I tell my boss about the situation and he gets pissed off, tells me that he told me to change rooms and I didn’t do anything about it, so there’s nothing he can really do. 

I take it upon myself to tell HR and they contact his boss from his office. I explained to HR that my issue wasn’t the fact that he was a guy, but rather that he was letting strange men into a room where a girl was sleeping. 

From what I’ve heard, his contract has been terminated, which isn’t really what I wanted, I just wanted him to be more considerate of how girls can feel in unsafe situations. So now I feel terrible for making the guy lose his job. 

A few people in the office heard about it and said I’m TA because nothing really happened. 

So, Reddit, AITA?",AITA for saying I didn’t mind sharing a hotel room with a guy but then contacting HR about it?
6,AmItheAsshole,"I (25F) have a 91 year old grandma. Last February she suffered a massive brain bleed. She now has some memory and speech impairment and she can no longer cook for herself but other than that she is still her same feisty self. She still lives in her own house but someone stays with her every night, my family takes turns checking in with her multiple times during the day, and there are nanny cams and life alert buttons throughout the house. I personally take her dinner and hang out with her for two hours everyday. She is my best friend and I am so grateful for the time I have with her. 

My Uncle Don winters in Arizona but he was back for his granddaughters birthday today and he stopped by my grandmas to say hi. Don wants my grandma to be in a home not because he thinks it’s what’s best for her but because he’s sick of checking on her when he’s home and he wants to sell her house to his son. He acts nice enough to her face (it’s super fake and she has noticed and asks why he bothers coming over when he just sits and watches tv without talking to her) but makes super passive aggressive snide comments to the rest of us about her and how he wants her in a home.  He’s out numbered by his siblings 3 to 1 so he deals with the arrangement. 

I was at grandmas when he came by and he walked in on my grandma talking about a really bad and painful experience that happened to her when she was about my age (short term memory is spotty but long term is mostly ok). He goes into the other room and loudly mutters “Jesus Christ it doesn’t matter.” Loudly enough for me and grandma to hear. It pissed me the fuck off so I got up and quietly but very very forcefully told him clearly it does still matter since she is talking about it 65 FUCKING YEARS LATER. I told him if he can’t be bothered to treat his mother like an actual human with thoughts and feelings he needs to get the fuck out. I told him he’s a piece of shit son since he can’t be bothered to respect her just because she’s been on earth longer than the rest of us.

He said nothing and just left. Grandma didn’t hear any of what I said so she was upset he left without saying goodbye. My mom is upset with how I said it but she is hopeful that this was a reality check for him. My other aunt and uncle are pissed at me and saying I overreacted and was unnecessarily an asshole and now my uncle Don is refusing to check on grandma when he’s back from Arizona. I fully admit I lost my shit and I do kind of regret what all I said but I also kinda feel like it was justified. So AITA?

EDIT: him refusing to check on her when he’s back means we may have to hire a part time home nurse year round rather than just during the winter like we have been. So I do feel like an asshole for causing this situation since home nurses are expensive.

INFO: my uncles caretaking duties included going over for 2-3 hours Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to make her lunch and keep her company. He never stays over night, only my mom, me, and my other uncle do that. My grandma does not need any assistance walking, dressing herself, or bathing. My mom does help wash her hair but I think that’s mostly because grandma likes having a “spa day” and it’s fun for them. We only have to help feed her, do her laundry, and give her her pills morning and night. Her brain damage affected her speech (sometimes she has a really hard time saying what she’s thinking or finding the right words), her memory (she knows she forgets stuff so she asks us to remind her of stuff quite a bit but it’s mostly minor stuff), her ability to read (it’s super weird if she focuses and tries to read she can’t but if she’s not thinking about it she can. If you’ve ever heard of something like that PM me), and her ability to run appliances. Since she has no trouble walking she’s not considered a fall risk aside from the fact that she’s 91 and shit can happen. Mainly she spends her days watching tv, puttsing around the house organizing and cleaning stuff, and hanging out with her cat. 

So basically she needs no additional medical care or nursing, she simply needs someone to check in with her to help out with chores and keep her company. Because of her age and the fact that shit can happen the doctor recommended we don’t leave her alone for more than 4 hours (plus she gets lonely easier since the brain bleed so she loves that we visit her so much). Unfortunately because of work my uncle Don who is retired is the only one with a schedule that allows him to go over for lunch duty during the week. My mom has looked into adult sitters in the area but unfortunately because of where we are the options are VERY limited. I’m honestly not sure what my mom has looked into regarding Medicare so I’m going to talk to her about that. It just sucks that we have to hire a home nurse that has a 4 hour minimum to simply go over and hang out and feed her. My mom did text me this morning and said we might be able to pay one of our family friends to hang out with her so that is awesome news. 

As for my uncle Dons relationship with his mom; they were great up until a couple years ago when he started to view her as a burden rather than a person. There was never a falling out with them, he simply got sick of visiting her. I mean he barely has to do shit to take care of her and he can’t even deign to do that so he just watches tv. He does talk with her sometimes and helps her out if she needs it but it’s the bare minimum. He’s generally not a dick with other things but when it comes to her he just has no empathy.",AITA for chewing out my uncle and telling him to leave?
7,AmItheAsshole,"I am not vegan or vegetarian, but I've always had friends/co-workers who are and I make an effort to provide options for them for parties/potlucks.

New job is not as accommodating to vegans, but I do have one vegan co-worker, let's call her Vegan, and I try to include her when I make goodies to bring in. Most of the others just think she's SOL and have the mentality of ""not my problem."" I think she's used to it, but you can tell she feels very excluded sometimes.

We have a birthday ""pool""  where you are randomly assigned a co-worker whose party you have to ""host."" It's nothing major, but you bring in a dessert, card, and bday decor for their cubicle.

It was my turn to ""host"" for a different, **non-vegan** co-worker. I got a nice cake and ice cream, and purchased a 2-pack of vegan cupcakes (they were nice and the flavors sounded really good). They weren't cheap, but she's our only vegan coworker.

Vegan got called away for something important and couldn't make the celebration. For context, another, older kinda snoody coworker (who's non-vegan) is always on some new ""diet"" that her ""nutritionist"" recommends. (It's bogus. This ""nutritionist"" has my coworker hold certain food items or ingredients in her hands and she's not supposed to eat anything that makes her arms tired while she's holding it. I shit you not.) She eats normal food and ""cheats"" all the time, especially for bday celebrations or when someone randomly brings in goodies. She also asked ""what's on the menu"" earlier when I was unloading my car, and I told her what I got and that I got Vegan her own cupcakes.

Anyways, at the party, I set the vegan cupcakes aside because Vegan got called away for work stuff. I mentioned to everyone to please not eat them because they were specifically for Vegan. Then as we're handing out cake, Diet Lady asked for one of Vegan's cupcakes. I relented, ""these are vegan and I bought them for Vegan,"" thinking she would take the big fat hint, since this is the third time she's heard this now. She *scoffed* and whined that she knows but she's on a diet so she can't have the normal cake and ice cream. Not wanting to cause a bigger fuss in front of everyone, I caved and nudged the box in her direction, saying she better save one for Vegan in a serious voice. She looked so offended like I was somehow being disrespectful to her and then was pissy the rest of the day to me. Meanwhile I had to put a 2-pack of cupcakes on Vegan's desk with one of the cupcakes missing.

I didn't buy these for you, Diet Lady. I spent $8 on those cupcakes for Vegan, and $30 on the cake and ice cream for everyone else. I didn't but these as a convenient option if you felt like ""being good."" Other people didn't want to over-indulge either, but they took a smaller piece of cake or skipped the ice cream. They didn't take someone else's cupcake.",AITA for asking and expecting omnivore co-workers (who never bring vegan options) to stay away from the vegan options that I choose to bring specifically for my one vegan co-worker??
8,AmItheAsshole,"My daughter is 11 and on the spectrum. She has this little stuffed owl that she loves. It’s called a squishmallow. I saw a few at this store called winners and purchased them. I hid them in my closet just so my daughter nor my other children found them. My daughter ended up finding them and was very upset that I thought to replace her favourite toy and was in tears over it. I had to reassure her that I just got her owl friends. All is clear now but I feel like I may have done something wrong. 

My eldest daughter (F16) was upset with me for enabling her behaviour because apparently she’s too old to be carrying around a stuffed toy. She’s embarrassed to be at the mall with her sister who carries around a toy. My son (M19) agrees with his sister about the embarrassment and is upset that I spent $30 on stuffed toys when I said no to giving him gas money.

9,AmItheAsshole,"My ex is a tattoo artist and when we were dating about five years ago he gave me a tattoo. The tattoo itself has nothing to do with my ex other than the fact that he put it on my body. It's a tattoo that I had wanted long before I even met him and was planning to get regardless of who put it on me. It isn't symbolic of him or our relationship in any way.

My current boyfriend who I've been dating for about two years thinks I should have it removed out of respect for him and our relationship. He thinks that since my ex is the one who did it, it's basically equivalent to if I'd had his name tattooed on me, claiming it's a sentimental reminded of my ex. It's not. At all.

10,AmItheAsshole,"So my son got a cheap stocking filler for Christmas. This toy that spins round, lights up and has an extra setting to sing jingle bells. On Christmas day it was fun but by the end of January the jingle bells bit becoming irritating. Even much so that after a while I have to confiscate/hide the toy so we get a break.  

The lights had stopped working but when you hit the toy they came on, so I figured a loose connection somewhere.  He loves this toy so much that when the lights stopped working I decided I try to fix it, even though it is a cheap throwaway toy not meant to last. So I opened it up and had a look at the connections making sure nothing was loose and trying to troubleshoot how we could fix it.  

After a while I really couldn't figure it out, but as I went to put it all back together I had an idea to disconnect the speaker. No more irritating music and no more need to hide the toy. He can play with it all the time and we get peace and quiet. Perfect for everyone. 

Now my son has not had any issue with this so far and is still loving the toy even though it doesn't light up or sing anymore. But my wife thinks I was cruel and am an a hole.

My son is not a vegetarian and usually eats what I make for my husband and I anyways. 

Today my husband and I decided to have tacos with ground turkey instead of beef because we wanted to try it and it’s a bit better for you health wise. My daughter was at work all day but I messaged her to ask if she wanted tacos too and if I could make a meatless filling for her. She said yes and asked me to make a sweet potato Chickpea filling.

When my son and daughter got home from dinner my son was weirded out by the fact we used ground turkey instead of beef and said we should have known he wouldn’t like that. He asked me to make a different filling with beef or chicken. At that point it was 5pm and nothing else was defrosted but even if I could have, there was no way I was making 3 fillings.

However, I am constantly finding my food that I pick out for myself gone when I go for it after about a week if I haven’t finished it. The only other person that lives here is my boyfriend. I’ve tried talking to him about it, and nothing changes. He’ll just sit there and binge on whatever he grabs regardless of it’s for him or me. I often find things I’ve set aside for lunch at work gone because he’s taken it. I just walked downstairs and he was polishing off my snap peas. I don’t think it should matter if I’m not finishing something in an hour. If I want to eat something throughout the week and I paid for it, it’s mine to do with what I will. 

We split the grocery bill evenly but at this point I’m tired of spending money on things I don’t even get to eat. It’s cutting into other funds so that I can re up on the things he eats and I’m starting to feel resentful. Since I’ve tried to talk about this with him multiple times and nothing has changed, I’m getting tired of bringing it up. I feel this is the only way to ensure I will get to eat what I pay for. I’m also considering having him do his own grocery shopping and me mine and re organizing the fridge so that we each have a shelf.

I understand that he has a much more physically demanding job but I still don’t think it’s fair that I have to go hungry and find my stuff gone by surprise because he doesn’t think about whether or not I want it, or even ask! 

Am I the AH? Am I overreacting? I’m just so done with this and it’s causing a lot of issues due to the resentment building up and oftentimes I don’t even want to talk to my boyfriend because I am so frustrated. Help me.

I’m a vegetarian by choice but I’m also incredibly lactose intolerant so the foods I choose for myself fit those needs.

Recently she told me she's having nostalgic thoughts of stripping and would like to see guys go crazy over her again and wants to dance at a local club on amateur night. I was thinking ""fine your decision"" until she asked me to come with. The club is non-alcoholic so I can attend under 21. I was stunned. I asked why and she said since the contest is heavily based on crowd applause she wants people cheering for her to compete with the much younger women. I told her ""you'd...be naked"" and she basically said ""oh come on like you've never seen me naked before."" Not the point, I've never seen her stripping off sexy clothes, gyrating in a way to make guys hard and spreading her legs. She then later asked if I could at least ask my friends to come with her, something I'm also not wanting to do, (""hey guys, you want to see my mom naked?"" Very very awkward.)

17,AmItheAsshole,"So on the way home, my (5M) son and I (31F) drove by the park down the street from our house to see if any kids were playing and he saw a boy his age with the same exact remote control car as his. We go home to grab his car so they can play together.

My son is very inquisitive and I love that about him, but I also know that I need to approach certain sensitive topics with some boundaries so he doesn’t say inappropriate things at inappropriate times. 

My son and this kid play for about 45 minutes and are having a blast and the kid leaves. 

My son comes over to me and says “he spoke a different language than me but we still had fun” I replied with, “isn’t that great that even tho you both speak a different language you can still find ways to have fun and communicate with each other?” Son exclaimed “yes!!”

Ended our conversation and headed back.

When we got home (we currently house share) I was in the other room but could hear my son telling his grandma (my mom 52F) about his encounter at the park. I know that my mom means well, but this entire conversation bothered me deeply.

*Son* says “we had the same exact remote control car and we were racing all over! He spoke a different language than me too”

18,AmItheAsshole,"Dad will be known as SD (sperm donor)

Background:
My (26F) parents separated when I was 2, my SD was caught with another woman. He moved out and paid my mom child support (never saw me) for the next few years. He only stopped when he got a knew girlfriend who incouraged him to have a relationship with his child. At the time, I'd never really had a father figure in my life so my mom agreed to every other weekend. Most of those weekends I was sat down in front of the TV watching cartoons. We never did anything together. Whenever we actually spent Time together, it was usually at the urging of his girlfriend.  


After about a year of that, he and the girlfriend broke up and he started to cancel my visits. After a while he just stop asking to see me and started paying support occasionally. After that, the only contact we had was a phone call every couple weeks.


When I was about 8ish my mom got married to my awesome step dad who I have a great relationship with. He treated me like his own from day 1 and now I call him 'dad'. 



Now I'm getting married late this year. It's going to be very small. 60 people in total, we aren't close at all so I didn't invite him. Invitations went out a few weeks ago.

19,AmItheAsshole,"I have 3 kids, an 18yo(Marc), and two 14yo(Emily, Amy). Marc is technically my step-son but I've raised him since he was 18 months old. He also has a very good biological father and we get along just fine. Marc has always had emotional issues that were originally just called ADHA eventually was diagnosed with OCD and BiPolar. When he started High School, he said he wanted to stop taking his medication because he didn't think he needed it. We disagreed, but unbeknownst to us, he just stated throwing them away in the morning. He was still going to school, and held a school job on vacation so he wasn't really acting much different. He slowly got more and more volatile though and two years ago, he stopped going to school and just started staying home and playing video games all day. Both my wife and I work mornings so we left before his bus came. He was eventually hospitalized for anxiety related issues. He got medication for anxiety, but doesn't ever take it because he says he's only anxious when he has to go to school. When he gets pushed to do something he doesn't want to, or if we have to change plans suddenly, he'll go into a rage and start screaming at us. He's broke two kitchens chairs and our bathroom sink. He still refuses to take his medication regularly, no longer had a job, isn't going to school, sits in silence at his therapist(we had three that just won't see him anymore because he won't speak)and doesn't help out with anything around the house including doing his own laundry or dishes. 

Both my wife and I just recently got job offers in another state that we've been planning on moving to for some time now. We haven't gotten to the point of asking Marc yet, but I don't want to take him with us. My wife says we can't just leave him, but I pointed out that he has a father that he already stays with 3 nights a week and he's 18 now anyway. I wouldn't mind taking him if he if I thought I could trust him to take his medication, but I can't. Am I the asshole here?


Throwing in an edit- 

1)The state were moving to is about a three hour drive. MA to NH. 

2) He does have an older brother, stepmom(of 10 years), and a step brother that he would be living with. 

3) I never implied that I don't want him to visit/ stay for a weekend every now and then. 

4) I'm going to involve his father in the next conversation, this was literally the first conversation as I just wanted to get on the same page as my wife first. 

5) I get that I'm bias. I'm a safety officer in a prison pysch hospital, so I see the worst case scenario every day. I know this doesn't mean it'll happen to my son, but it does linger in the back of my head. 

6) When not medicated, my daughter's have left the house and gone to a neighbor's house because they didn't feel safe alone with him. We no longer leave him alone with them.

7) He has been given ultimatums about having to take his medication before or he would have to live with his dad. I'm not going to pack him up in the middle of the night and push him out of the rolling car.

8) All this destructive behavior is only when he's not medicated. When medicated, he will take care of himself, cook for himself, drive, work, do laundry etc.",AITA - for not wanting to take my 18yo son with us when we move out of state?
20,AmItheAsshole,"I'm a bisexual female. The current LGBT+ club at my university is a fucking shambles.

It's run by a heterosexual couple. Neither of them are in any way gender non conforming or anything other than straight, but they're in an open relationship and they're allies, which apparently makes them qualified to run the LGBT+ club. Technically, they weren't elected. The previous head of the club stepped down and someone else was elected and then they asked the woman in the couple, who was a friend of hers, for help, and from there she pretty much took over and brought her boyfriend in.

The premise of the club was to be apolitical, it was just somewhere that a bunch of LGBT+ people could meet and make friends, but they've changed that to a different political topic every week, most of which is about allies and non-monogamous relationships.

They've also got more than a bit exclusionary. They basically asked someone who is non binary to shave or stop coming, saying they made other people uncomfortable, when no one else had a problem with it. I started dating a guy and they told me that as we are a cis woman and a cis man in a monogamous relationship I didn't really need the club and told me other people didn't want someone who was practically ""normal"" in the club when I am friends with everyone in the club and they were happy I'd found someone.

I got fed up so right before Christmas when the uni posted that applications for new clubs and societies were open. As theirs is technically categorised as a club, I categorised mine as a society, so it's 2 separate things, albeit with a very similar concept. When asked why I felt the society was needed, I wrote that while there is nothing wrong with the current club, I felt a society would be a nice alternative, as a club requires a set goal, while a society is far closer to a social gathering with no set goal in mind. I had to get 20 signatures, and I got them with a combination of friends who are in the current club, and LGBT+ friends outside of the club (including the other person who was asked to stop coming).

My request was rejected by the university, and they're now assigning someone to sit in on the existing club to determine if there is an actual need for it and the club is apparently in jeopardy.

The couple who run the club told people and I now have some people on my side and some saying I should have just left well enough alone because I may have now screwed it up for everyone else.

Since November, my job has cut my hours temporarily (normally I work 38-40 a week, now it's more like 25-28).

I should make a note, I do NOT live with my boyfriend, and our finances are not shared. Since we started dating, we have split date costs, taking turns treating the other person.

My mother lives 20mins away and I live downtown in a shared apartment with my roommate. I go over every Sunday and we watch Netflix and order in food that she pays for, but I pick up and bring over.

Yesterday, I got a call from my boss telling me not to come in, because there wasn't any work for me to do. I came in anyways worked about 3 hours, then I left, and went to a local bookstore. While I was there, I found a book based on a show I watched that I didn't realize was a book! It was 12.99, and I still have \~8 dollars on a gift card. I bought it, then settled in a chair and read for a little while before taking my purchase home. (Full disclosure, I also had a cinnamon roll and a water which was another 5$) All in all, I paid about 10$ for a relaxing afternoon.

I will admit, I have been very stressed about my money and job situation for awhile. However, my bills are all still being paid, and I'm not dipping into savings. It's just that my spending money is practically non-existent (I'd say total I have about 20-40$ at the end of each paycheck after bills). The last few months, when it's my turn for date night, I've been cooking for us, and we do game nights/movie nights etc. Well my boyfriend saw the book on the counter when he came over last night, and the receipt and asked me why I bought it when I'm broke. He got upset with me and started saying things about how irresponsible I am with money, and it's reason's like this that I'm always low on funds. I stated, that I'm hardly an over spender, and the reason I'm low on funds are my hours getting cut. He brought up about how I never take him out anymore, and that he feels like he can't say anything because he knows I'm dealing with work stuff, but now he's not so sure he buys that anymore if I can ""waste money"" like that. It turned into a pretty nasty fight.

It has been suggested that I edit to add:

\-My mother was in agreement with my boyfriend over frivolous spending, because she spent her life saving everywhere she could. In her mind, she pays for a meal for me every week, so that is money I could be saving right there. I have tried numerous times to explain to her, that working/saving is not as easy as it was for her, and that she does NOT have to spend money on dinner for me if she doesn't want to. My retort was, yes she pays for my dinner, but I still help by picking it up and bringing it to her so she doesn't have to go out. (she doesn't like to go to restaurants because of tipping). I'll admit I definetly over reacted when talking to my mom, which is why she is still upset because in her eyes ""she's just helping""

\-I don't know what's up with the boyfriend, but based on the comments, I'm thinking it maybe has something to do with him knowing how frugal I am, and how I DO complain about the current situation.

\-I was told to add: The benefits at my job are the reason I stay, they are excellent, and also, I am NOT at risk of being let go, neither is anyone else.

24,AmItheAsshole,"Our local cineplex is a free-seating theatre, unless you go for the D-Box seats which are those seats that move around with the movements in the movie. Seating is a big deal for me, and so I was so determined to get good seats that I booked D-Box tickets online 3 days in advance.

We showed up to our seats just as the previews were starting. As a group of 5 start filling in to our left one of the guys ""casually"" mentions that they're actually a group of 7, and that their other 2 friends are seated to our right but at the very end of the row (10 seats away?) and ""you could switch with them so that we could be seated together, if you want.""

Their seats weren't great. I had booked days in advance to avoid paying this much money for less than great seats. At that exact moment, one of the girls sitting at the end came up to us and basically repeated everything her friend just told us, suggesting we could take up some of the empty D-box seats in front of us.

At this point the theatre was filling up, but the D-box seats in front of us were still empty. We decided not to take the chance since people were still showing up.

I kid you NOT, about 8 minutes later (trailers still rolling), she comes up to us AGAIN saying ""soooo looks like these seats are good for you, yeah?"" referring to the D-box row in front of us. My husband replied saying that it's occupants could still show up late and we'd be forced to move and that we were good.

I'm not sure whether they had just shown up late or just decided to switch from the normal seats, but I feel like the idiots to my left would have booked those seats in a row had they been available. Or, could have been a booking mishap, so I can't be certain.

They were absolute morons, but I feel conflicted. I could have avoided the entire thing (and actually enjoyed my movie) if I had simply agreed to let these adult humans enjoy their night joined at the hip.

Let people into traffic when you can, hold the door for others, and DON'T TALK DURING THE MOVIE! Things like that.

 So the short of the story is: I went to the movies with my girlfriend and a few other friends.  The movie was pretty packed so there weren't many open seats. There happened to be two open ones to my right and about five minutes into the movie a couple walk in, maybe in their early twenties, and take the two open seats. They proceed to have a conversation for the next half hour of the movie while the woman used her phone while using her purse to try and cover it up. At least two people in the theater audibly made the shh sound, I'm guessing aimed at the couple next to me. This didn't work though as they continued to talk. The conversation wasn't even about the movie mind you. So finally I had enough, lent over and very nice and respectfully whispered to them to please stop talking.

The girlfriend/wife snapped at me and told me to ""mind my business"".

 I responded very calmly again with "" with the talking and using the phone I'm having trouble paying attention, can you please stop?""

The boyfriend/husband now looked at me and made a condescending ""shh"" noise very loud at me.

So I finally lost it a bit, and in a normal voice said ""if you don't stop I'm gonna get you kicked out"".  A few people around us clapped when they heard me say this. The woman said ""whatever"" but they did stop talking and using the phone. The movie finished and while we were walking out in the lobby is where the trouble started. The man proceeded to yell "" can we talk now?"" at me. I didn't respond and kept walking. They followed us a little and again he yelled "" I just wanna make sure its OK to talk, I don't wanna get kicked out"". This is where I made a mistake. I turned and said back to him "" dude you don't talk or text during a movie. Anybody with half a brain knows that."" BIG MISTAKE. He proceeded to tell me to go F$#k myself and yelling at me until the security guard/cop in the lobby who thankfully had seen the altercation went over and talked to the guy and he calmed down and we left.

But here's where I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. After my girlfriend and a few of my friends were pissed at me for asking them to stop talking. Said I should have just let it go because look what it caused.

My defense was I couldn't have known how they would react? A sane person would have apologized and stopped talking. I admit I was wrong for firing back at the guy in the lobby but I will not apologize for asking someone to have a shred of decency and abide by a generally known rule that you don't talk during the movie. If it was just a whisper here or there I would have been fine to let it go.but it was a full on conversation while the woman was texting.

AITA here or am I losing my mind?",AITA for not letting go that I wasn't wrong for asking someone to be quiet during a movie in a theater?
26,AmItheAsshole,"So I’m visiting my MILs house with my family. Her extreme sense of tidiness is only eclipsed by her love for her granddaughter and it is eclipsed by a LOT. I came home late night and had to pee and to avoid waking anyone up, I didn’t turn on the bathroom light. Unbeknownst to me, someone had put the seat down and my first five seconds of release splashed onto the cover and everything within pee reach. I thought I did a good job cleaning until the next morning when MIL comes into the living room and says “UMMM why does it smell like pee is on the walls of the bathroom??”. I was embarrassed so I said “oh Kelly (my two year old) didn’t quite make it the toilet last night, we’ll take care of it”. She laughed it off as “oh kids will do that!” I deep cleaned the bathroom and it met standards afterwards but AITA for throwing my two year old under the bus for a pee accident?

27,AmItheAsshole,"My wife Vicky is an accountant working in the city. She normally wears high heels to work but doesn't have to do too much walking in them since she's at her desk in the office. Yesterday however she had a client meeting. She didn't bring a change of shoes and kept her heels when she travelled to meet the client. Once that meeting was done she got a call from her manager saying that due to a family emergency she was unable to attend her own client meeting, so could Vicky please do so for her. She had to get a train to the other client, which was packed meaning she had to spend more time standing in those heels. 

When Vicky got home she was in a lot of pain and asked me to rub her feet. I work night shifts and while I still had some time left, I spend whole shifts on my feet often doing heavy manual labour, so I thought Vicky was being ridiculous. It's not that I didn't feel sorry for her having to stand and walk around all day in those heels, but steel toe safety boots aren't exactly comfortable either.

I sent a photo of a dress in the color I was looking for to the girls in our group chat and gave them free range to pick any style of dress they wanted, as long as the color was consistent. They sounded really excited and agreed.

Well, my maid of honor just sent me a screenshot of a conversation that took place in a separate group chat they have for planning the bachelorette party. Two of the girls were complaining about the dress color and saying they thought they were going to look really bad, and one of them said verbatim that she was dreading looking like a “f-ing traffic cone.”

30,AmItheAsshole,"Jess and I work together, and we became close friends. When we started a couple years ago, we'd go for nights out once or twice a week, we travelled together, etc.

This year, she had a baby and it seems like she's got a lot of stress and anxiety after giving birth. She said she feels like people don't treat her like a whole person anymore, always asking first about the baby, ignoring her to coo over her baby, acting like her whole identity is ""mommy"" and she's stressed this won't go away for a long time. That the same thing will happen with her, as with her mom, who stayed at home and lost a lot of her identity outside of being a mother. And once the kids had grown, struggled with finding work.

I said that I couldn't help how other people act, but I could promise her I wouldn't treat her any differently, I wouldn't bring up family stuff unless she did first, and we could start doing girls nights again.

When we go out, it's just like it's always been. We gossip and vent about work, we talk about where we'd want to travel, we go to parties and hang out and talk to loads of people, we get up to all sorts of adventures and misadventures. We've done a couple short weekend trips. 

She sometimes vents about parenting, and I've always asked if she wants to talk, or to get her mind off it for a night. And she almost always wants to get a night off.

Anyway, last weekend, I went over to Jess's place to help her and her husband move some new furniture in and assemble it. At one point, Jess was taking their son out in the stroller and I got to talking with her husband, who seemed kind of frosty towards me.

He asked me if I got the impression she was adjusting well to motherhood, and I said ""I figure you'd know better than me, you do all that parenting stuff with her, I don't."" 

He asked if we talk about that, and I said not really. And he said that's what he thought, and ""whenever I come by I act like she's not even a mother, we make plans for girly vacations and nights out.""  

I was feeling a little weirded out, and I was like ""I dunno, that's what our friendship has always been like, that hasn't changed.""

And then he started talking a lot at me, I didn't really get a word in edgewise for a bit. He said that people's lives change when they become parents, he knows he's been changed so much by fatherhood. And he's concerned she and I are still acting like 'college girls without a care in the world' and that our friendship and activities haven't grown and changed to work with their growing family. And that it seemed like I was hanging out with Jess, trying to treat her like she never even had a baby.

I didn't know what to say, I didn't think it was my business to say that that was what Jess had wanted. So I just said that this sounds like a conversation he needs to have with his wife.

31,AmItheAsshole,"My parents aren't good with technology and find it difficult to do basic stuff on their phones. They bought my younger brother (let's call him brandon) a phone recently and since they don't know anything about parental controls, my mom stays concerned about what he uses it for.

Tbh, he's just a lot into games and music and not a lot else. 

This morning, my mom and I were having breakfast when she asked if Brandon's gmail is logged into my dad's phone too. I said he might've used dad's phone to check his inbox or whatever, no biggie. Mom then said Brandon's been watching ""dirty stuff"" because she saw it in his youtube history. 

I rolled my eyes bc I know it's none of my business but I'd have to deal with it because it's a big deal for mom.

I checked if Brandon's gmail was logged into my dad's phone that she so confidently claimed, it wasn't. My dad just has the same profile picture for no apparent reason. 

I said nothing for a while but she said she'll have to speak to my brother about this. This was when I decided to intervene. I told her she saw dad's youtube history and not my brother's. She was noticeably embarrassed. Called me in her room after a while and said I shouldn't walk around in short clothes or be braless around the house bc my brother's ""growing up""

Speaking from how well I know my mom, arguing would've been no good. But I argued anyway ""Now that's NOT on me. I'll wear whatever I think is comfortable. I couldn't care less who's ""growing up"".

Because I've worked there for a few years, there are a lot of kids that know me, come up and have little conversations with me. Some kids want me to come over to their table while they're eating lunch so we can talk. Usually we talk about cool things we're doing over the weekend, tell each other a few jokes, etc.

There is a 4th grade teacher that noticed me talking to some of her kids, and she didnt like it. She told the vice principal, who told me to not be so close to the kids, because it ""looks weird"".

I got a little upset and told the vice principal my concerns. I told her that I felt discriminated  against because I'm one of the only male employees at the school.

Hello, I am new here, so please be nice if I get something wrong.

About two years ago I moved to another city for educational purposes. I rented a two bedroom flat and was looking for a roommate to share costs. I am the main tenant, my roommate is a subtenant legally.

Before I made the decision to give her the room we discussed some things: I don't come from a wealthy family, I basically support myself, so I don't have a lot of money, which makes it really really important to me to get my degree as fast as possible. I told her how I would prefer someone who doesn't like to party and make a lot of noise and so on, since I need to focus on studying. She agreed to that. We seemed to get along well, so I let her move in.Two months in, she tells me she would want do adopt a cat. I don't like cats at all, like really really DO NOT like them. After some discussion I agree, but only under the condition that all the work and inconvenience the cat brings with it is on her. I don't wanna take care of the cat, I don't wanna be a cat sitter while she goes away for days or whatever, I don't want to feed the cat, I sure don't want to clean up after the cat, I don't want the cat in my room. She agrees and gets the cat.

I have to admit, I find the cat pretty annoying, it makes quite some noise, but I just suck it up. She did everything for the cat, until recently.

About two weeks ago she tells me she is pregnant. I did not expect that at all. I kinda felt like it would be reasonable for her to move out and that she wanted to tell me that, but no, she wants to keep the baby and to keep living here with me. I am really hesitant to live with a newborn and told her, we would need to discuss this further. Since I am the main tenant I could kick her out, but I don't want to be an asshole and would like for us to find a solution we all can agree on. Since it's quite some time until her due date we are not so much in a hurry.But there is another problem. She wants me to clean the cat's toilet. I know, it can be dangerous for pregnant women to clean a cat's litter box, but I never wanted the cat, we both agreed that the cat would be her, and only her, duty.  I am disgusted by cat poop. We got in quite a fight about that. She refuses to clean the toilet, so the flat smells pretty bad. I feel sorry for the cat, but I never wanted it, I don't see why I should be the one responsible for something I never wanted and made sure to be clear is not my duty. Her boyfriend comes by every couple days and cleans the cat box, but that is not enough. It smells like shit everywhere and the cat pissed on the floor yesterday, probably she's frustrated, too.

So, AITA for not wanting to clean up after a cat I never wanted to begin with?  


  


  
EDIT: So it was quite a morning/day here. I joined her for breakfast and tried talking to her this morning. I told her how I feel the cat is being neglected and it smells really bad and that I cannot live like this any longer. I asked her how she thinks we could handle the situation. Her only response was for me to look after the cat while she is pregnant, once the baby's born she would do it herself again. I think this is unfair, we never agreed to these things and I made very clear I needed peace and quiet from the get go so a baby was never on the table. She told me how things change and we all need to adjust.  
I said I think she needs to move out. She definitely does not consider moving out.  
We got into a fight again, then I left to go for a walk (I do this when I am overwhelmed sometime). On my walk I called my landlord. I admitted that I let her talk me into the cat and basically told him everything, how she is not cleaning after the cat because of her pregnancy, how she wants to stay here with the baby. I was totally honest with him. He sure as hell does not want her to live in his property with a baby. I considered writing her a formal termination of our contract and sending it to her (so she has to sign the papers that she got it), I would of course not mention the pregnancy in the termination, just the cat. He thinks that could be tough because she could pull the pregnancy card. Where I live an owner of a flat is allowed to kick his tenants our (giving them three months notice) if he needs the flat for himself (or family members). He suggested to do that and after she moves out I would get another contract under the condition that he wants to have a say in the next roommate I am picking. I would be fine with that, but I am a little bit scared he will not renew my contract and just kick us both out. At this point I am kinda willing to take that risk just to get away from her. Since her contract is dependent on mine, I would give her one month, while my landlord has to give me three. This way maybe I get out of all this drama without even having to move my stuff.  


  
I thank all of you for opening my eyes. I still fell kinda assholish, because she is pregnant, but she really pissed me off this morning with all that entitlement.

35,AmItheAsshole,"My wife has a parenting blog and I told her she needed to take it down or I’d find a way to get it taken down myself. 

It started as updates about our daughter’s autism diagnosis that was sent to just family and friends. But somewhere along the line it went from being for family to being for close friends, to being for friends and acquaintances, to eventually being public. 

Then it expanded to basic updates about the well-being and status of our daughter to just regular blogging about our kids and our life. 

She doesn’t use the kids names, but she uses her real name, so it isn’t hard to put two and two together and identify the kids. 

Now I’m realizing our kids friends parents, our neighbors, and perfect strangers know about goings on in our home and private stuff like discipline situations with the kids and their personal and intimate moments in their lives. I just became really weirded out.

But our daughter’s autism has been very hard on all of us and my wife does have a community through this blog. She doesn’t have many outlets to connect with people because she’s caring for our daughter most of the time. 

When I bring up the issue of the privacy of our kids, she says it’s a necessary sacrifice because her blog is a supportive teaching tool for other parents, especially those with autism, and censoring the difficult stuff would defeat the purpose of showing them they’re not alone. Basically that we have to be selfless about this. 

I’m not dropping the issue but the more emotional she gets about changing the settings or taking it down the more I wonder if I’m being an asshole who isn’t understanding her position or how much the blog is helping other people.  AITA?",AITA for demanding my wife shut down her parenting blog?

Before we were married we split up for 8 months, and in that time he started sleeping with CJ again. We ended up getting back together (dated for 2 years before mariage) and everything has been great with us for over 5 years now.

40,AmItheAsshole,"So, my boyfriend and I have lived together for almost 4 years. He is almost always on his computer playing games and talks to his friends in discord. This has taken a huge adjustment on my part because before this I didn’t really spent time around computers or people who used them so frequently. The reason it’s an issue is because for about 3 of these years, the computer is in our bedroom due to space restrictions. He tends to get loud and will slam on the keyboard and we end up fighting because I try to sleep. We’re on different schedules so he’s always on while I’m trying to sleep.
Recently, we’ve had to move back in with my parents and we live in a big open room. His computer is maybe 10 feet or so from the couch. Now  I have some severe anxiety problems, which is a whole different issue that I am working on, but I have to sleep with the tv on with sound and a light. This bothers my boyfriend a lot. So in order for him to sleep, I have been sleeping on the couch for 6 months so I can have my tv and light on. He sleeps in the bed around the corner where he can’t see the light or hear the tv. Great.

Now, I just started this semester, I have 6 classes and I’m starting my first real job in my major  as I’m graduating in May. So my schedule requires me to wake up around 5am M-S. This week, he’s gone to the gym and stuff with his friends and has been coming home around midnight, which is fine but he keeps waking me up and claims to not be loud. (He is)
Well tonight, I’m almost at a breaking point. I start my first real job tomorrow and have to be up at 5. He’s on his computer and kept talking which drives me insane as it’s literally right there. I kept getting mad because he wouldn’t stop. He freaked out on my screaming that it’s not even that loud and I need to calm the fuck down. 

Now I’m laying here crying because it feels so disrespectful that he can’t not talk on his computer for an hour so I can sleep, especially the day before I start my job. Then he really has the nerve to scream at me because I was mad. I have never done anything to disturb him while he sleeps, but this has been an issue for me for years. It just seems so unfair that every night he gets a good night sleep but multiple times a week I am being disturbed by him. I also have sleeping problems and struggle to sleep to begin with. 

Am I overreacting?",AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for talking on his computer while I try to sleep?
41,AmItheAsshole,"So, I'm trying to figure out if I'm overstepping my bounds here. My girlfriend and I have lived together for about a year. We get along well and I really enjoy living with her but we have some differences in cleanliness. Growing up my mom was a total clean freak, so I try to be concious that my standards might not always be the norm or reasonable.

Well, something that has started to bother me is the fact that she'll come home after a long shift at work, and won't shower until the next day. Personally, I love showers, and love taking them before bed to cleanse myself from the day and wind down. I understand that after a long day, most people just want to pass out, and showering can be a chore. However, my girlfriend works as a bartender/server, and often works 40-50 hrs per week. She spends the day running around, sweating, getting food/drinks on herself in the process. When she comes home, she smells of sweat or cooking oil (which is pretty much unavoidable for industry workers). The issue is, she jumps straight into bed with me, sticky and smelling, and usually on sheets I've recently washed. I wash the sheets twice as often now, and find myself avoiding cuddling before bed because I've just showered and have pretty sensitive skin. I have started to gently ask when she gets home if she plans on showering but she just laughs it off and says she'll shower in the morning, and just brushes her teeth before coming to bed. I don't think she knows that I'm hinting, and I don't want her to feel like I'm calling her gross or something so I always drop it.

Am I being a controlling asshole here? Or is this a resonable expectation of a partner? I hate the idea that I'd make her feel dirty or embarrassed by this. I can learn to get over it, but I hate the feeling of sleeping in dirty sheets and miss cuddling.



EDIT: thanks for the input so far everyone! To touch on a few points:

-I haven't directly spoken to her about it yet because I wasn't sure if it's even a reasonable concern to have. Wanted outside opinions first to give me some insight.

-Washing/drying her hair isn't really an issue as she has very curly hair that only needs washing once or twice a week. I don't expect her to wash her hair every night. Just rinse off from food/sweat smells.

-I don't think I'm being hypersensitive about the smell because she makes jokes about it too. The other night she took off her shoes and fake gagged because her feet smelled so bad.

The guy told her if she remembered she used to tell him he was really short. My gf was outraged because she remembered him calling her hippie and bullying her to the point that she had to start calling him short. The whole thing pissed her off and she told me. Me, being someone who was fairly bullied in high school, told her she should let it go and that the fact that the guy remembered the whole thing upside down meant that she'd hurt him some. She doesn't want to see that point of view and is pissed with me because she doesn't feel I'm trying to put myself in her shoes. Her mom always sides with her which I don't think is fair. I feel that if I really love her I should try to make her rise above the occasion. She should see the guy with pity and not with anger. Because the guy is still self conscious about his stature. But She's just pissed at me for telling her. 

My question is AITA for telling her she should look at it from a different frame? And because instead of just acknowledging how she feels I went and told her to feel otherwise?

43,AmItheAsshole,"I got married 16th November last year. It was a great day except my half sister, who was one of my bridesmaids, pissed me off a bit.

She was the only relative in my bridesmaids and the other 2 were childhood friends. We're not super close as we didn't grow up together and I only learned of her existence 5/6 years ago, but dad asked me to include her. We did make an effort to make her feel welcome, but I felt like she didn't seem at all interested in the wedding. I get that we're not close but even with people who I'm only just meeting who tell me they're engaged I'll still congratulate them or ask questions, meanwhile she was unaffected on finding out I was engaged and seemed disinterested in all wedding stuff.

With the dresses I knew I couldn't put them all in the same thing as they all have completely different body types. I gave them 2 requirements: dark green, and under £100 because I'd be paying them back. There was a group chat where the 2 bridesmaids who were my friends both posted dress ideas and I chose out of what they liked, while my half sister posted a picture of a dress and said she'd already bought and paid for it. No problem, it was cute and it was the right colour so I said it looked nice, reimbursed her, and moved on.

Wedding day. Everyone is getting ready at my place. She shows up with hair, makeup, and nails done. She complains to me that she had to get up early to get them done professionally. I have no problem with this, but the problem I did have is that if I asked her to do anything she would say she couldn't. I asked her to pass me a hair slide and help button my dress and she said both times she didn't want to mess up her nails. Just really unhelpful, and sat there watching TV while we all got ready. She then put on her dress (she arrived in joggers and t shirt) and the dress was the wrong colour. It looked similar to what she showed us online but instead of it being a dark green it was really bright, bordering neon. She said that it had just arrived wrong, but that was months before the wedding, and she never thought to say anything. If she had I'd have said to send it back and find another.

Wedding happens, she looks really out of place with everyone else in dark colours, and eventually it's time for the reception. She sits with dad and our stepmum while my friends say they could really do with some help. I end up doing both bride and bridesmaid stuff while she sits and has a chat. Half hour later she asks if I need help. I tell her to just leave me alone. She looked a bit put out but that was it.

I didn't know what I said was an issue until today, when I called dad to ask what he wanted to do for his birthday, and he said that he wanted to have separate things with me and my half sister. I asked why and he said she said I was rude at my wedding and called me a ""bridezilla"".

44,AmItheAsshole,"My sister died from a drug overdose when she was 21 and I was 19 on January 23rd 2010. It’s a rough day for me and my parents every year, but the ten year mark is one of “those” milestones. Yeah, it sucks. 

A little backstory here: on a car trip home from my home state, my husband mentioned that his coworker wants them both to trip on DMT. It apparently makes you feel how you feel when you’re dying. I drink and my husband smokes pot. I take no issue with him having his fun and he works hard as well as provides, but I was uncomfortable with this one. I have a friend who did a similar drug and ended up with a neuropsychological condition, so I said I didn’t want him to. He said OK. 

Move forward a month, it’s my sister’s anniversary (same day every year and I reminded him up to the morning of). He works second and me third. I picked up a shift Thursday and already asked my boss if I could leave between 1-2 and they said absolutely np. Told husband that. Cool, so I can have something in the day to take my mind off of stuff and then have a great night with him. He usually works 7 days a week, so us having a night together is a treat. He has Friday off. 

He went to coworker’s after and did DMT. He was also pretty high at home and couldn’t hold onto a conversation. He wasn’t present really at all besides sitting next to me for two hours. He kept talking about his trip and seemed to not take into consideration that maybe I don’t want to hear all about how death-like experiences feel on my sister’s death day from the most important person to me. 

Then he wants to sleep. Fine. I was disappointed because even though it’s late and he works VERY hard, I wanted more than to leave work early, hear him ramble about drugs, talk about death, and watch him be distracted on his phone. 

He kind of tried to turn it on me that I was starting an argument when I started to tear up, that I “never” let him sleep (occasionally I’ll ask him to stay up an extra 15 minutes), that he “doesn’t know what to do with me” in these situations (no crying; just teared up), that he’s good for telling me he did DMT instead of lying, and that he didn’t plan on doing it, “it just worked out that way.” 

I didn’t yell at him or anything, but I was honest about how he was tone deaf as hell for talking a drug emulating the feeling of death on my sister’s anniversary and he’s kind of an asshole for forgetting. 

We hugged and kissed and he’s in bed. I’m just here on my couch feeling terrible. Am I being too hard on him for something trivial because it’s a rough day for me? I’d appreciate perspective since mine is tainted. Please be civil. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: he was high on pot when I got home. He took DMT earlier.

EDIT:: this got a lot more attention than I thought it would. Seriously, thank you all for your insight; you’ve given me a lot to think about. I also got so much support from this and I can’t tell you how many posts genuinely touched my heart. Thank you family reddit. You are all awesome.

45,AmItheAsshole,"I am a small business owner. I have an employee who joined us three years back but ever since she joined her personal life was in some sort of upheaval. Just two months after joining she took a month's time out to plan her wedding, post that there were frequent requests for leaves and apologies for non-shows. Anytime I tried to confront her she would always begin to cry and tell me how she is trying her best to survive but is also going through a lot personally so I should understand. Everytime I said no for a leave she would say that maybe she will have to quit because it is not working out for her. After that she was pregnant and it was a complicated pregnancy so I ended up giving her close 7 months time off with full pay. After the maternity leave there was always one or the other issue with her kid or family or husband and to me it always felt like she blames work for all of it (even though it isn't hectic at all). Last week for the first time, I said no to her for a request for leave because I really need to get some projects finished and she completely snapped at me first, then apologised, then began to cry, then got angry again and then said that she will start looking for other jobs. So I fired her and asked her to not come from next day onwards itself. I do know that this female has major depression and anxiety issues but I didn't want to deal with so much emotional drama for a team member who isn't even that great at work. I kept feeling like I am her mother. Am I the asshole here?

Yesterday she randomly sprung on my during dinner that I can’t be in the room. Not I don’t want you in the room, not a discussion, no warning, nothing, you can’t be in the room. Just 9 days before. She could go into labor any minute.

I asked why and why she didn’t tell me before. She says just because and says she’s not talking about it. I ask why again and say that I would like to be there and she just doesn’t respond. Not even a “I don’t want to talk about it” just nothing.

I tell her I’d like an explanation and would have appreciated a little bit more warning, no response again. I’m getting annoyed at this point that she won’t even speak, so I just say “come up with a reason and tell me soon” and walk away. 

She never did, this morning I asked and she again just ignored me. I asked if there was anything going on and she said “it’s my decision”.

I finally get mad, but control myself and in a calm voice say “I realize it’s your decision but it’s a big moment and I’d like to be there.

47,AmItheAsshole,"My(m26) dad has always been an alcoholic. When i was younger he was abusive, but now hes just a mess. He smokes cigarettes in the kitchen throughout most of the day to my moms dismay, who spends a lot of time there cooking and hates the smell of smoke. Whenever we tell him that it bothers everyone in the kitchen he just says its his house and doesnt do anything about it.

Anyways, for the past 2 months hes been falling down when drunk multiple times a week. i have to pick up his 250 pound self and push him onto the couch. lately he busted his nose, pissed his pants and went to the hospital. not gonna lie, it was pretty fucking nasty to pick him up considering he doesnt bathe much either. 

Both his GP and the ER doctors who saw him said he needs to stop drinking. So for the past week, I’ve been throwing away any alcohol he buys(which is every single day) and hes been complaining, yelling, and screaming about how he needs his drinks non-stop about how its not my right to do that. I told him that if I have to pick him up, then its my right to do that. (There have been times where I was frustrated and left him on the floor for 20 minutes and he begged me to pick him up, and swore he was never going to drink again, then the next day said that he never said that and that the floor was slippery and it was only an accident) My mom hates that he drinks but thinks I am being ruthless about it. Shes not necessarily disapproving, but she basically said that I am relentless to just not care about his constant whining and complaining.

I believe that since the doctors say no drinking, and because I have to go through picking him up which is no easy task, considering the weight and the stench, that I am justified in disposing of any alcohol he tries to buy.

48,AmItheAsshole,"My best friend Terra comes over every Tuesday to watch Bach. We smoke weed and get food and she spends the night. Recently I've gained a ton of weight and am worried about developing diabetes as it runs in my family, so I'm trying to get better eating habits. I told Terra that I'm placing a blanket ban on junk food in my apartment because I have no self control, and having it around (the bags, the smell, someone eating it) makes me want to get it myself. I told her she could eat before she comes over and that I'd make us popcorn for snacking. She said this is fine, but by the end of the night the munchies kick in and she ends up ordering ice cream or fries.

Newbie here (F 38) :) Feel free to tell me if I am doing this the wrong way. Also, I'm french and my english is far from perfect so you may come accross some grammar mistakes. Sorry about that. 

Here is my situation :
As you may have noticed in my username, I work as an accountant (not a CPA, just a regular accountant). Almost ten years ago, I got hired by my current employer (n+2). I was without experience (just a couple of internships) but I was given a chance. I took it and, long story short, it worked well. I started with a minimum gross wage (18k€ a year). Now, I earn almost 40k€ a year (gross salary). I love my job and the working atmosphere is pretty good. Over the years, I took as much responsabilities as I could. As a result, there are now many stuffs that I am the only one to know how to do. For example, I am in charge of the settings of our softwares. I have several files that none of my coworkers understand and they would have a hard time to catch up. Unfortunately, we are drowned with work : can't have a sick day (in 10 years!), unpaid overtime hours and no enough vacation days taken (I have like a 50 days remaining holidays balance). 

Recently, I was offered a job in an other Company. They proposed a 57k€ salary. I asked for 70k€ and, basically, they said yes. 
This is a huge amount of money and I am considering to seize the opportunity. But, I would leave my current colleagues in difficulties. We already have to much work to do. We try to hire more people for months but we couldn't find anyone yet (our area of expertise is really specific).

50,AmItheAsshole,"While my wife was pregnant and for the last six months after she gave birth I waited on her hand and foot. Need water? Sure. 3 o clock ice cream? Of course! Back rub? Anything for you!

The thing is, her pregnancy had zero complications. It went literally about as well as pregnancy can go. It’s been six months and she still expects me to act like she’s 8 months pregnant.

She’s not nice about it either. No thanks you, please isn’t in her vocabulary, and god forbid I’m slow or don’t feel like it. I finally got sick of it today and told her that she’s fine now and she can care for herself.

Unless there’s something she can’t do, she can get her own water now. I’m not getting up every ten seconds to do stuff for her, I have things to do as well. 

She immediately yells at me and calls me uncaring and says that she went through “a huge life changing process”, and that I should “support her”. She’s already lost the pregnancy weight for the most part, no ppd, nothing. 

I say that yelling at me isn’t going to get her anywhere and that I’m not doing it anymore. She then starts crying and saying how she can’t believe she married someone so mean. She always does this, just cries and cries whenever I try and say anything.

I said that the crying isn’t going to work this time and she got pissed and said she wasn’t faking it and told me to get a hotel room. This happened yesterday.

I tell him, if he doesn’t like what popcorn does to him, he doesn’t have to eat it! He could get a different movie snack and leave mine alone! He says that I can’t expect him not to eat popcorn if it’s right there in front of him. 

I have tried getting a smaller popcorn, just for myself. He ate a good bit of it. I tried preemptively buying a different snack for him. He ate it and then also a good bit of popcorn. I tried putting the bag on the other side of me, he gets an empty container and pours some out. 

At this point, I feel like he needs to learn some self control! I shouldn’t have to go without popcorn because he can’t help himself! He says it’s unreasonable for me to expect him not to eat it, and going without saves money anyway. Most of our friends are split on the issue.

Brett and I have never gotten along super well. Obviously he's my brother so I tolerate him to be polite in social situations, but, and I try to put this mildly, he's a brute.

Whereas I'm a mathematician, he works as a mechanic for my dad because he couldn't graduate college. We never shared any interests or hobbies and he was always incredibly insensitive about my difficulties with women. To put it frankly, I would not associate with him if my mother didn't make me (don't get me started on how my dad encourages it).

My difficulties with women turned around last year when I met Shelly. Although our relationship is a bit nonconventional, I love her beyond all belief and she genuinely makes me happy. Cue my brother trying to convince me that she's taking advantage of me and that I should stop seeing her (I'm pretty sure he was jealous because he had just gotten dumped, I even told him as much).

Anyway, eventually after him harassing me for months about leaving her, as well as other things like going to the gym with him and trying to eat ""healthy"", I cut him out. I very politely stopped responding when he would speak to me and told my parents they could either have him or me at Christmas dinner, but not us both. 

Unfortunately this really upset my mom (again, my dad always takes his side so he can go fuck himself). So eventually, after she cried a lot, I agreed to go if I could bring Shelly.

And OF COURSE at the end of the night he got drunk, we started arguing, and in front of my dad he asked me how many guys she has slept with (before and after we got together). At this point I very politely got up and told him to never speak to me again. Shelly and I took an Uber home.

Got pulled into my bosses office right when I got in. Turns out our company is laying off a bunch of people. Since I’m in charge of a team of 5 people (myself included) I have to choose the two people who are getting laid off. I have to make this choice by 3pm and tell hr so they can get all the paperwork and stuff done before the end of the day.

One is a no brainer. She’s just started working here a month ago and is less experienced than everyone else.

The second choice is harder. 

The guy I’m thinking of has to leave early a lot now because his daughter is sick and in the hospital. Because of her illness he is also much less focused and gets behind on his work.

 I told him I understood he’s going through a rough time now, but that I needed him to focus and to not leave work early as much anymore. 

But it’s not easy to say no in the moment when he’s rushing out the door because his daughter just had a medical complication and he needs to be there.

So I didn’t push the issue anymore. We were able to manage our workload with the people we had and well family is important.

But if I lay off another employee instead of him that just leaves me with 2 employees and a guy that’s not always there.

I don’t think we would be able to stay on our tight schedule, especially since I often need people to work overtime and late into the night. 

If we don’t get our work done on time I know all the blame is going to be on me and with them laying people off it doesn’t seem like a good idea look like I’m underperforming compared to everyone else.

Still I know he probably needs the job and since our work pays for our insurance his daughters treatment might be affected. I don’t know how it works exactly, but it’s probably not good.

58,AmItheAsshole,"So we just got our mocks back from a few weeks ago and generally I did very well. However, I just got my economics paper 1 back and I did a grade worse than all the others which is odd considering I am predicted the highest grade possible (A* and I got a B). This is very concerning as I don't have much longer to improve my grade. 

When we began going over the mocks in class with the teacher giving corrections he didn't hand out a mark scheme so I got it up on my phone. The first question was a simple maths one which asked you to find a ratio. The mark scheme said my answer was correct but the teacher had marked it incorrect, not just on my paper but everyone's who put the same answer as me. My essay marks were also lower than they should be. One of the grade boundaries (Level 3 16-21 marks) says few technical errors, some good analysis and some good evaluation. I like to think that I had that in my essay but my teacher gave me 15 marks, in a level where there only needed some coherent analysis and evaluation with errors. I wouldn't be that frustrated but he didn't leave any comments on my work, only ticks which makes me think he is just handing out marks randomly. He has done this in the past, he gave me 7/9 on an essay with no comments so I asked for some after the lesson and he re-read my essay to find mistakes. 

We have a new economics teacher who used to be the head of economics but was promoted. He has come back to take over part of our teachers work in the run up to exams. He is much better qualified, with a master's in economics, and I think he would be able to give me much better feedback than my current teacher.

60,AmItheAsshole,"A few days ago while I was at work I started experiencing one of the worst headaches I’ve ever had. My neck was also really stiff and I couldn’t bend it down. I messaged my Mom (who used to work in the medical field) and my fiancé. My fiancé told me to come home, take some Tylenol, and have a shower.  My Mom told me to go to urgent care because headache + stiff neck was suspicious to her b/c of meningitis. I messaged my fiancé and told him this, he said that there’s no way we can afford an urgent care visit with the amount of debt (student loans credit card debt) that we have piled up. I said I’d go to the cheapest urgent care office, he just said “okay if you want to be dramatic” and refused to message me anymore.

I talked to my Mom more. I didn’t have a fever or anything so I felt kind of ridiculous leaving work and going to urgent care but I did. They said my neck was super stiff and they were concerned and told me to go to the emergency room. I called my fiancé upset and asking if he’d come to the urgent care office or come pick me up. He said that I could go to the hospital and “live out my hypochondriac dreams” for all he cared. 

I didn’t know what to do but people were telling me it could be a serious problem. I felt ridiculous going to the emergency room for a headache but I did. My Mom was there with me. We waited a really long time because it seemed like nobody cared especially since I didn’t have a fever. They took some blood and then admitted me to the hospital and gave me an IV and Tylenol, just like my fiancé recommended I do. I was crying at this point because I knew that this was going to cost serious money we couldn’t afford and I felt like I was being ridiculously over dramatic about a migraine or something like my boyfriend said. They did a CT and spinal tap and there was nothing and my Mom drove me home.

When I got home it was like getting to a funeral because he was so mad. He asked if I was dying, I said no that it was just a headache. He said “oh so if you just did what I told you to we wouldn’t be another $10,000 in debt, is that what you were saying?” I didn’t feel like arguing so I just went to sleep. 

I feel so ridiculous now that I didn’t do what he told me to and I got worked up and I went to urgent care and the hospital. I didn’t want to add more debt to what’s already there and we definitely can’t afford it. He’s not talking to me now except to ask once or twice if I felt like I was dying and if I needed a helicopter to take me to the ER.

61,AmItheAsshole,"I am 15F, I rarely take any medication for migraines, cramps, headaches or soreness. I get headaches pretty often and I feel dizzy and sick throughout the day. The ringing in my ear used to be really unpleasant that it would lead to migraines. I do not have access to medication, so I ask my mom every now and then. Last night, headache was getting worse. So, I asked my mom for some tylenol. She raised her voice and said "" YOU ARE TOO RELIANT ON DRUGS. I HAVEN'T TAKEN TYLENOL IN A YEAR! YOU GOTTA DEAL WITH MIGRAINES"". I made no comment, took the pill she reluctantly and angrily took out of her purse and went to bed. If she never touches tylenol and will not use it even if it is in her purse, what is the point of carrying a bottle? I ask for tylenol once or twice a month, I try my best to withstand headaches but sometimes I can't.

62,AmItheAsshole,"Every summer I go on vacation with my family and we rent out a section of condos together on this particular street. 


I’m not married and I don’t have kids so I’ve always had a friend or 2 stay with me at my condo. Zoe has accompanied me the last 3 years or so.


Last year Zoe was reading texts to me that she sent her boyfriend. He asked how her vacation was going and she said “boring”. 


The last night the whole family is still there, we have a campfire and hang out together all night. No one misses this event. Except last year, Zoe missed it. She stayed at the condo because she “didn’t feel like hanging out”. 


Then to top it all off, her one and only Instagram post about the whole week was “A week in paradise is nothing when you have the sweetest man waiting for you at home”. Which isn’t the worst thing in the world but a slap in the face when she just stayed in my condo for free, ate food my family cooked for her(we rotate meals and eat as a family most days) 



Since it’s January, she knows now is when we book the place and she asked me if I’d done it yet. 


I said “yes, Carly and Lila are staying with me” hinting that it would be just us and she wasn’t invited. She didn’t get the hint. She said “well I’m not sharing a room with Carly because she snores”. 


So I had to do it. I told her “look, your behavior last year was fucked up and I’m sorry if it seems like I’m holding a grudge but I really don’t think you should come this year. You didn’t even enjoy it last year”. 


She was in denial and said that stuff didn’t happen the way I’m saying it did. She says she doesn’t remember that text conversation happening at all. 


She said the reason she didn’t come to the fire was because of a migraine. Which is BS because I know how she gets when she has a migraine. She throws up, can’t get out of bed, etc but she was drinking wine that night at the condo by herself. 



And she said I was overreacting about the Instagram post.",AITA for telling my friend she’s not invited on vacation
63,AmItheAsshole,"I work in a co-working space that is shared by various companies. We all have badged access to the workspace. Guests are allowed but each person needs to usher their own guest or let the concierge know who they are there to see and the concierge can contact them about the guests arrival.

Today, I was about to walk out of the badged (secured) area and I saw a lady (african american) standing outside very close to the exit door waiting. As I tried to exit she stayed real close to the door and barely gave me any space to get out. I said ""excuse me"" and she didnt move. So I opened the door not too wide so that I can squeez out. I had a feeling that she was trying to piggyback and get in to the secured area. And as soon as I got out, she put her hand to prevent the door from closing and got inside. I asked her, ""excuse me, do you have a badge?"". She said, yes it is with my friend there (pointing in some direction). I said ""where is your friend? I dont see anybody"". She is like ""she is there, she has my badge"". I said ""ma'am, maybe you should check in with the concierge and they can usher you in"". But she didnt pay any heed and went inside.

So I went to the concierge desk (which is about 10 feet away from this area) and told them everything. I was hoping that they would follow the lady and ask her about her friend etc. Instead the concierge lady said, ""okay, we will keep an eye"" and went back to doing their usual stuff. They were not at all alarmed by this. In the meanwhile, this lady comes back towards the concierge all pissed and shows off a badge. And the concierge lady told me ""we will take care of the security here""....basically telling me to mind my own business. I was like ""okay fine"". I must say that I was very shocked at this dont-care attitude of the conierge. My concern is, many people leave their valuables behind thinking its secured area. But it is not.

I go back to my working space again, and this lady sees me and informs her friend. This friend approaches me and starts scolding me saying what I did was insinuating and that I should not have done to a lady of color. I should have been more careful and that I should think about my bahevior etc.

I told her it has nothing to do with color. I myself am dark skin (srilankan). I told this friend, ""maam it has nothing to do with color, I myself am dark skin. I saw her piggybacking on my account and I had to stop her. Its a matter of security"". And this friend still continued in a louder tone so people around can hear as well that what I did was not good towards a lady of color.

Please tell me if I am wrong? I swear I would have asked anyone else the same thing about badge. I feel terrible now because somebody falsely accused me about discrimination and it was embarrassing as others witnessed this including my coworkers.

EDIT - Thank you all who took time to read and respond. I am guilty here, I should not have taken matters in my hand (and be hero). But I swear to god, it had nothing to do with color or race. I should have just informed and moved on. Lesson learnt. I will try to locate this friend and send my apologies thru her. I feel so guilty now. But thanks for listening to a stranger.

EDIT2 - There is no security policy in place for this coworking space. There are no rules to stop piggybacking etc. The smartass in me just assumed that badged access means no piggybacking. I was not asked to enforce any security. I have asked the concierge about what do to if somebody tries to piggyback and they said they will discuss with their bosses (but they also dont want me to take matters in hand). So until I hear anything differently from concierge, I will not care about piggybacking and not leave my valuables behind a badged area. Thank you all for your feedback. I admit IATA and I plan to apologize to this lady for everything (but not discrimination because that was never on my mind)",AITA - Asking a person about their badge when they tried to sneak into secured area piggybacking on my account.
64,AmItheAsshole,"Hello people of Reddit! I’m usually a lurker but could use some outside opinions. I work for a company which is about to have a personal grievance laid against them by an ex employee - I’ll call her Katie. Charlie is our 2IC. 

With employees that Charlie dislikes personally, it is reported that she cuts the hours of until they were forced to quit and makes personal remarks that she considers to be jokes but aren’t appropriate. With employees that she favours, she gossips about other coworkers with. Generally any interaction that I’ve had with her have not been pleasant. For example when I requested to try and be allowed to take all my entitled breaks, Charlie immediately was furious at the suggestion and stated that it was not okay, that I was not a team player for suggesting it, and that if I had a problem then to take it to the big boss. I also have called in sick in the past and have had to report this to Charlie who was aggressive upon hearing that I was unwell and unable to make it in. I have considered quitting many times due to her behaviour. 

Katie called me up a couple of weeks ago inquiring about girls who have requested store transfers. I had a feeling this was due to Charlie’s behaviour and asked. This was confirmed where she mentioned that Charlie had been causing her distress through remarks being made about her weight, race,  and competency to do the job. As my position is simply a retail worker, I informed her that the best option was to discuss this with the big boss and try and find a resolution.

She recently let me know she was resigning as the situation worsened. She found a new job and Charlie went in and make the “joke” of wishing the new company luck working with Katie. That she was “f*cken useless”. Katie’s new boss reported this to both Katie and our company’s boss. It was apparently something our boss took care off. However clearly not because she apparently went in two days later and made a scene again. This caused Katie to undertake a personal grievance towards the company for bullying and slander. She asked for an anonymous statement from me which I provided.

Charlie has now been informing the girls that she likes that Katie’s boss came in and told her not to ever threaten her workers again. Charlie claims she never set foot in the store. And is worried Katie was saying stuff about her that apparently isn’t true.

So Reddit, AITA for writing my statement for Katie’s personal grievance and allowing our 2IC and company to face any potential consequences?",AITA for aiding in potentially getting the 2IC fired?

________________________________________________

I'm a 19F currently attending university.

One of my main professor's insists on using the whiteboard in class, for explaining everything and anything. Whether it's words or diagrams or explanations, so it's pretty important to be able to read.

Here's the problem: i'm colourblind and i cannot distinguish the difference between red and green ... like at all. It just looks the same to me.

This is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.

So i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.

The professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.

(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).

Anyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! 

I got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.

I feel pretty bad. I don't want this guys career to suffer just because of some pens haha. The stress is getting to me. AITA reddit?",AITA for getting our teacher suspended for using red and green pens in class only?
66,AmItheAsshole,"Yesterday my mum called me to tell me they were going to break up and that she would be picking up my brother(9 months) and I up from my grandmas house later since her boyfriend would be moving out and she didn’t want us to be around that environment but they ended up reconciling since he said sorry for the first time in an argument. I was so upset to hear this, I was really happy to hear they’d broken up it felt like a weight had been lifted off of my chest. 

He belittles my mum and makes her feel like she’s useless even though she does a lot more than he does. He only goes to work when he comes home he just relaxes even on his days off. While my mum works 4 days a week (12 hour shifts) then after work she has to look after  my brother during the night, gets up to feed him, comfort him - he has never helped out during nights. Even on my mums days off she’s looking after my brother. He constantly acts like she doesn’t do much even though she does this all of this while he does the bare minimum. My mum is upset and crying almost everyday because of something he’s said or done. He gets upset at her for being upset at him and tells her to shut up.  He has no consideration whatsoever and is the most selfish person I’ve met, he’s spends money on luxuries for himself despite us being dirt broke. He also brings down the mood which is why we have started to exclude him out of family outings. 

Even on HER birthday he decided to go get a $400 tattoo and didn’t do anything for my mum. The whole week he had hyped up that he made a reservation for her favourite restaurant she barely goes out so she was so happy to go and finally have a nice break yet when the day came he said he was too tired to go so ended up just taking her to a fast food restaurant.  

He even takes his anger out on my brother who is a baby. While my brother was 4 months he would get angry at my brother for crying while my mum popped out to run an errand. He would yell at my brother to shut up and call him a stupid little boy and say boys don’t cry.  He is extremely incapable of looking after my brother and has never before - for more than an hour. 

I’m so stressed and tired that even I know how to parent my brother better than his own dad even though I’m only 16. I look after my brother for 12 hours while my mum works and during some nights so my mum can have a good sleep since she works then comes home to look after my brother and never gets a break. I’m just so stressed since he’s caused so much stress for everyone in my family it hurts me and I can’t go on living in a house with him anymore. 

However, I feel like an asshole as its very selfish wanting to move out since it will affect my mum and brothers life since I babysit and help around the house most and since he’s said sorry and said he will change and  she forgave him should I just let it go?

67,AmItheAsshole,"I am a new father to a 5 week old baby, I am a longshoreman and my wife is consultant. My wife is currently on maternity leave, however due to a work emergency my wife was forced to head back to work for a week with the promise that she could take an additional two weeks of maternity leave in trade. She accepted the deal however because my son is still too young to start infant care (the program we enrolled him in starts at 8 weeks) I had to cover for her by taking a week off of work. 

My wife has been really stressed with childcare and has frequently expressed frustration with how she's constantly tired, feels run down and said she resents how she's being treated by everyone like she's just a mom now instead of a professional. I sympathized and have tried picking up as much slack as I can, however she's having a rough go of it. She was screened for PPD by her OB and her OB believes she doesn't have it, she just thinks my wife is in an adjustment period with being a new mom. 

The issue occurred when my wife came back from her week long stint back at work (she needed to travel to another city and was at a hotel for a week) and was teasing me about how I probably feel terrible looking after him for a week by myself. I responded honestly and said it was amazing, and I felt like I was on vacation just hanging out with my buddy. There were many sleepless nights with him, but I made up time by napping during the day, and I am used to that because I deal with him at night a lot anyway while I am working since I'm a night owl.

68,AmItheAsshole,"First post! On mobile.
For some backstory my roomate/landlord ""M"" has been using heroin for 20+ years (he's 40) and from what I can see has no intentions of stopping. Well if you've ever seen somebody high on heroin they usually just nod in and out until they eventually fall asleep, not M. 
He screams at the top of his lungs and stomps all around our single wide trailer for hours on end sometimes as late as 6 am. ( I work night shift) He has had the cops called on him multiple times from the same neighborh an older lady who lives in the trailer diagonal to us. 
The first few times they showed up gave him a warning and left. After about 3 warnings they arrested him for a week and then agian for a month. Both times the other two roommates and myself have completely drained our savings to make sure he didnt lose his trailer or his car. (Never got so much as a thank you btw.) 
Well I geuss the older lady moved out because he has gone on multiple several day benders and the cops never got called. Now one of the other roommates ""A"" works dayshift and M and the other roommate ""T""(also an addict but doesn't scream) work from 2 till 11 pm so they usually get home around midnight get high and M goes at it while A is trying to sleep and he is still yelling most nights when I get home at around 4 am. Then he wakes up T and I at around 1pm. So I'm going off of 4-5hours most nights. And some weekends he just doesn't stop. Then come monday he cant speak because his vocal chords are absolutely shredded. 
We have confronted him quite a few times about it but he just brushes it off and gives a lame excuse.Now I have been around addicts pretty much my whole life and I believe that in a lot of cases people need help not punishment but they have to want to get better which he simply seems to not want to do. Both roommates have threatened to call the cops but havent. If he goes to jail agian they will probably keep him for 90 days and he will likely lose his job (again), car and maybe even his trailer.So WIBTA if I call the cops on him while he's high?

I moved out for my first semester of this year, but my mom was okay with it because i was living with a friend of hers. I had to move back a few months ago because my roommate is moving out of the country, and my mom’s bf moved in while i was not there. I cant stand him, and all him and my mom do is fight constantly and they both are impossible to live with. My mom has a history of being really manipulative and controlling and its making it hard to deal with, 

My current plan was to wait until two of my best friends from my college were ready to move out, but ill likely be graduating before they are both prepared. However, i have two friends from a shopping center i used to work in who have a room available. The rent is cheap and its a nice area, and its in the city i take the bus from for college. It’s in a really good area for my commute to school, but if i take their offer it’ll likely cause a lot of problems with my mom and grandparents (who are also controlling).

70,AmItheAsshole,"My sister, let's call her Louise, is one year younger than me. When Louise was 15 she met a 21 years old guy, let's call him Martin. It's worth mentioning that age of consent where I live is 15, so it was technically legal, but still disgusting. Everyone including me thought that this relationship is sick and unnatural. After some time he moved in with us, against everyone's disapproval, but no-one did anything about it.

The relationship was uneven from a very beginning. He constantly used the fact that he has more money than her to set their life as he wanted it to be. They married as soon as she got 18. Later they moved to a different country when they both had good jobs and she started to have her own money and started to be more emotionally independent. But then he decided to go back because he had better job opportunity. She had difficulty finding any job in our home country since he stopped her from going to school and she technically only graduated from elementary school. 

After few weeks she found a job as a babysitter. That's where the fights between both of them started to go really heavy. They were constantly threating one another with a divorce. Sometimes he'd move out and come back a day later. 

One day they broke up, what I fought, for real this time. She came back from work and found  that he took all of the furniture as he told he bought it before they were married. All of her stuff were laying on the floor in the middle of an empty room and he was gone. This was really shocking and devastating not only for her, but also for our family who witnessed it. That day she went to see a lawyer and started proceeding to get divorced. I supported her in that, also I tried to not have ""I told you so"" face, since reality of the divorce was very sad and brutal.

And few weeks later, guess who shows up! Martin, of course. They come in the house together all happy. That's where something broke in me. I stood up and said: ""Martin, after all this happened I don't want to see you in this house. I may have not legal means to stop you from moving in, but I want you to know it. What you did was wrong and disgusting and I don't want you in my life. If you want to be together, just be together, but somewhere else."" He just nodded, turned around and left.

They moved in with his parents, then tried to find a place for themselves. It didn't work out, the fights started all over again and they eventually really broke up and really got a divorce. 

This all happened few years ago. Few days ago I heard Louise telling her friend that she used to be married but the marriage didn't work out because of me. According to her words, if I didn't told him to go, they would be together and happy. The only reason they broke up is that they didn't have a decent place to live together so me denying it to them was a deal-breaker.

71,AmItheAsshole,"So, my wife and separated for over a year now and the house where I used to park (which is first come first serve unmetered public street parking) I have moved out of. I only got a new permanent address last month so I can finally register my vehicle to park in my new hood which requires a permit. 

For the last several months I have basically moved my truck around public street parking in the vicinity of my old house. I still jointly own the house and pay property taxes in that hood. The parking spot I have been usually parking in is right next to a church parking lot. I park there because it’s not in front of anyone’s house or business so I’m not taking anyone’s spot. I even left a note on my dashboard explaining that if anyone had an issue to just text or call me and I left a google voice number.

Nobody has called or messaged or left a note or anything.

Today after driving around a bit I returned to that spot and as I left the truck I was approached by a guy who started angrily quizzing me on where I lived and why I parked there. I explained I parked there because I don’t use the truck that often and I wanted to park it where it wouldn’t be in anyone’s way. He told me it was in his way and that it was hurting a local business (it was parked halfway down the block from the business) and complained that I had left it there for 2 weeks at a time. I rarely left it there more than 3-4 days at a time but I’d return there and almost always find that spot or area free so I’d park there again.

The conversation quickly devolved into yelling and cursing and him threatening to make my vehicle disappear. Then he told me he didn’t even live on that street but that I had no right to continue parking there. Many fuck you’s were delivered from both of us and it all stopped just short of a fistfight, all because he felt I shouldn’t park where I was parked.

I moved it because I didn’t wanna deal with the hassle for the next week because I get it registered to my new address soon enough, but ffs it’s a public space not blocking anyone or taking up anyone’s spot. Everyone has a right to park there.","AITA for parking for extended periods in a public, unmarked street-parking spot."

73,AmItheAsshole,"
I don’t know where to start so I’ll explain best how I got the car. About 5 years ago, my mom bought a 1999 Jeep Wrangler which she had always wanted with one of her tax returns. Because it was only a two door and it was not enough for my family of 6, she decided to get a slightly newer 4 door Jeep and she would let my step-dad drive the older one since his car was breaking down. However, when my mom initially got the newer Jeep, she said that I could get the older Jeep once I got my license and learned how to drive stick shift. After this, it was always established and agreed upon by everyone in my family (including my stepdad) that I would eventually get the car. However, about a year ago, my mom and step dad got divorced, and as a result, the 4 of us kids moved with our mom and my stepdad started renting a room from one of his friends. When my parents split, my stepdad had  0 responsibilities besides paying his rent and phone bill, and he barely helped with the transition of moving, keep in mind he still worked full time. My mom wanted to avoid as much conflict as possible so she didn’t complain. However, she made sure to specifically include in the divorce papers that the older Jeep goes to me. As of today, my stepdad still doesn’t have his own license, and for as long as I can remember, he has never had one. I was always told that it was because he gets anxiety over taking tests but I feel like there hits a point where that doesn’t matter, he still needs a license. Even I currently have my permit, and I’m close to getting my license. On the day I got my permit, I told my dad the exact date that I would be able to get my license, so he had ample time to save up money for a car of his own. On top of that, he also got to keep a majority of the tax return from the last year that my parents were together, which was about $5000. Recently, my stepdad was pulled over driving without a license, but he was let off easy. Because of that, my mom told him that he was not to drive the Jeep until he got his license, because if it got impounded, I would be fucked out of a car. Then, I found out a few days later that he was letting his friend drive the car since he couldn’t, which was a huge no no for me. As a result, I told him to drop off the car at my moms house, despite whether or not he had a car yet. He went on a tangent about how he spent his money getting the car fixed up just for it to get taken away for him, and about how taking the car would make it hard on him and the people he is staying with. I told him that it was his fault for not managing his money and for spending it on my car instead of saving up for his own. He dropped off the car about two weeks ago and my family hasn’t heard anything from him since. I kinda feel bad for taking the car knowing that he needs it but at the same time I feel like he has had plenty of time and he needs to grow up and get his own car and a license.

74,AmItheAsshole,"I'm currently in another country, on business.

I was released from my obligations here a little bit early, and I have time to see some historical sights while I'm here.

However, my husband insists that I must stay in the hotel, because it's unfair that he doesn't get to experience it as well.

Unfortunately, this historical sight is a very important piece of history, of which I am very interested in and read a lot about.

If I go see the sight, he would be very upset.

I've spoken with my business partners, and they say their husbands/wifes would be upset if their significant other had a *chance* to see it and *they didn't*. To me, this is how a loving person would respond. I would have the same opinion if the roles were reversed.

Am I the asshole for wanting to see the sight? Should I go anyway?

edit: This is hard for me, because I do love him and wish for him to be happy.

edit2: I did it anyway. It was great. Had a long talk about it. He says it's because I don't show him love enough. I feel like I give him everything and disagree. He says he'd be happy otherwise. I think it's more than that, and probably deserves another post for me to get better advice in that regard. My opinion, even if there are relationship issues, the mechanics of this issue are deeply wrong (not wanting me to enjoy myself), and there is more too this than is not being said.

edit3: This happens a little in other ways as well. If I travel to another city for work (New York, etc), when we discuss traveling again, he refuses to ever go their because ""you already went there"", but he is visibly annoyed by it. This time however, that problem was amplified.

edit4: When we went out to restaurants with colleagues and customers, I feel it's always needed to say that we discussed work items, instead of enjoying each other's company. Going out with customers is a part of.the deal, and I shouldn't have to feel the need to say that ""we discussed only work, nothing else"".

edit5: Don't read my post history, it won't make sense. I've obscured some facts out of fear he will know I posted this. I'd die if this ended up on the front page of Reddit and in memes on Facebook.","AITA for traveling while on business, and wanted to sight see for a few hours without my husband?"

Rent is ridiculous in my city with a tiny box room on a shared house being around £1,000 a month before bills. My parent's place is in the suburbs so it takes me about 40 minutes to get into work in the morning and just over an hour if I'm drinking in the city after midnight.

My parents have retied to another country and want to sell the house, in the mean time I'm allowed to live in it rent free whilst I'm busy saving to buy a house. I pay all the bills and have a comfortable little pad set up for me.

Shortly after our engagement she got an opportunity to go work for a family as a live-in babysitter in United States, so she took it.

I texted her immediately to tell her we have a date set and got this amazing almost 700 years old manor reserved for the wedding to take place at, expecting her to be happy for us.

After that she stopped talking to me completely, only stating a real friend would wait and I should wait for her to come back, so she can attend my wedding.

78,AmItheAsshole,"My wife and I are getting my daughter baptized (catholic). She wants her sister be our daughter’s god mother. Up until a few months ago I got along with my SIL. SIL was applying for grad school/pursuing music on the side and is living with us. SIL offered to help take care of our daughter since she’s always home which seemed great. My wife was going back to work and I started a new career.

2 months go by and she starts developing an attitude with me. When I talked to her about it she told me she's feeling stressed/depressed and that my wife and I aren't doing enough with the baby and she's doing it all on her own. This is understandable b/c my job was 1 hour away with traffic and I was initially worked a lot of OT. When I got home I couldn’t help much as I was tired and trying to get used to the new schedule (get up at 5am, drive 1 hr, work 8-10 hrs, drive 1 hr).

I tried talking to her and said that once I get some experience I could get a better job closer to home. I started trying harder to do more with my daughter, but had some problems and made some mistakes with keeping her on track with feeding schedule and sometimes not picking up after leaving napkins and bibs behind. Since I made extra money with OT I offered to buy her a keyboard piano to help with musical aspirations and as a way to say thank you. Aside from my wife covering her living expenses, we weren’t paying her.

Things got better for a while, but she soon started again with the attitude. I got tired of it and told her I wouldn’t buy her her piano as she didn’t deserve it. She got upset as she has always wanted one. I reconsidered and bought it for her and apologized for any harsh words on my part. We still didn’t talk which is understandable since some cool off time is needed. 

My wife and I eventually hired a sitter and I continued to watch my daughter when I came home from work. I still made some mistakes here and there (same as before) and she would get mad. This resulted in an argument which I told her I didn’t need her constant nagging and condescending attitude. She got upset by this and we haven’t been on speaking terms the last 6 months. During which I give SIL her space. I’ve at times tried to talk to her to see if she’s willing to talk it in general, but she doesn’t speak much so I leave her be. 

The last straw was when I sent my wife, SIL, and MIL to get massages for SIL’s birthday. When they return I ask how everything was she walks passed me and says  “it was okay” and doesn’t utter another word.

Meanwhile my wife’s family has been pressuring her to get my daughter baptized soon as SIL will be moving 1 hr away for grad school. I feel like I don’t want her to be my daughter’s GM b/c of her attitude toward me. I don’t want her to negativity influence my daughter. I would like to resolve things with SIL, but I don’t think she wants to which is okay since that is her prerogative. I told my wife that I’d like to put this off until then.","AITA b/c my wife wants to make my SIL our daughter’s Godmother, but I don’t b/c we had a falling out"
79,AmItheAsshole,"Hi all 
So I have a friend with Autism he is extremely high functioning. He has a little bit of trade education. I am working towards a college degree.  He comes from an extremely disfunctinal family with an trauma history. That stretches back 2 generations. He has had very little loving discipline and talking to his mum, she has stated oh, we just assumed that it was autism behavior and let it go we figured it was just  person x.

Now person x is an adult and wondering why I won't put up with childish tantrums, put boundaries on the relationship( was texting at all hours) 

I have an autoimmune disorder and over Christmas discovered mold in my unit. He was telling me I was over exaggerating my symptoms and my risk factors if I got his cold.. 

He then got really angry when I sent him some simple English language pamphlets about autoimmune disorders and mould( I was lucky enough to stay out of hospital) 

So I texted him to invite him to an event Tommrow and get a rant instead. 
As I am not family I have called his family ones that actually care and explained that his behavior is why he doesn't have a job, or many friends And the behaviors got better for a while but when we do things it has to be what he wanted to do and what serves him.
Would I be an asshole if I stopped calling/ responding to his texts?

We don’t report to each other and are basically at the same level. This week he handed me a list of dates and told me to plan, order catering for and execute 5 different student events. I told him I could try to assist, but I’m not in charge of events, he is. I’m also not available on many of the days, as he just sprung this on me last minute and already had meetings planned. I told him all of the dates I’m not available and that he needed to make other arrangements or change the dates so I can assist. He told me he “doesn’t have the bandwidth” and to “figure it out”. I can’t “figure it out” though since I have meetings and other events I cannot move around because my boss requires me to attend them.

So my best friend, we’ll call her Tracy, has type 1 herpes below the belt. She’s had it for about 4 years, doesn’t get outbreaks, and also doesn’t take meds for it. She recently confided in me about this.

I was trying to be helpful and give her advice and so I told her that it would probably be best for her to stay away from normal dating apps (like tinder, bumble, etc) because she’ll probably just face more rejection since dating on those apps is already hard enough. I told her she should make some accounts on the apps for people who are positive for STIs. 

Tracy was hurt that I said this because she said she’s tried those apps and they made her feel like a pariah and she also argued that 50% of people in the US have her type of herpes. To which I told her that yes, technically this is true, but most of those cases are oral aka cold sores.

This happened about a week ago and I can really tell that I hurt her feelings but I was just trying to be helpful. I mean, I really think most guys (at least at our age) just aren’t going to want to date someone with herpes, which sucks but is the unfortunate reality of the situation.

82,AmItheAsshole,"So im the manager of a construction company set up by my parents before they retired a few years ago and although I'm relatively young to be running it (28) I think I'm doing pritty well. 
Around 6 months ago a friend on my father's lost his job and because of his age (mid 50s) he was having trouble finding other work so I was asked to give him a job, so I did because i knew the guy had a lot of experience in the area. 
As soon as he started I noticed him either not listening to me or just rolling his eyes when ever I took charge and he would occasionally make comments like ""I know what I'm doing"" and ""I've been doing this longer then you. But I ignored this because I figured it must be hard for him to be taking orders from someone almost half his age so I mostly ignored it...until yesterday.
Yesterday I was having a few issues with one of our clients (nothing major we just couldn't decide on the best way to procide with the job) and he suddenly comes out with 
""Achually can I just talk to your boss so I can make sure theres no misunderstandings?"" 
So I slightly surprised respond with 
""Oh sorry if I never made it clear but I'm the manager""
And his face instantly turned in to a glare and he said 
""Common kid dont try and pull that I'm fully aware that hes the manager"" and he pointed straight to my father's friend 
At this point I ask the client if that man had been saying hes the manager. He confirmed that he had been under the assumption that he was since the start of the job and he had also been discussing details of the job with him as well. 
So as you can expect I go and talk to my fathers friend and ask him if hes been pretending to be in charge. 
And he didn't even denay it and started trying to claim that he knows how to run a company better anyway.

83,AmItheAsshole,"I was on one of those airport rail links they have to get you to different sections of large airports. I was just staring outside the window enjoying the scenery in a moderately crowded train (people were standing, but you could still move around freely)

This attractive woman got on and I did glance at her for a couple seconds but as I had a girlfriend back home and it’s rude to stare at anyone I went back to appreciating scenery quickly. However since my right eye is blind, it seems to onlookers that I’m staring at something on the right side of my periphery. Hence I was staring outside, but the woman was standing to the right so it kinda looked like I was staring at her.

So this other woman walks up to me, blue pixie cut and catty voice and just starts to go off on me for staring. I admit I was riled up pretty much immediately and asked her if she was in the business of making fun of disabled people instead of diffusing the situation. When she asked what the fuck I was talking about I pointed to my eye and said “I can only see out of my left, which was clearly appreciating the scenery outside”. She responded but honestly I wasn’t listening and just told her to fuck off with her assumptions. The rest of the passengers started kind of looking at us, mostly her.

When I got off the train and told my girlfriend about it on the phone in the waiting area she agreed with me, but her friend who shared the story with was mad at me for not understanding what women go through or something.

Now the road to his second marriage was rocky, it started off with my dad having an affair. He then proposed the idea of getting married to his (now) second wife. Mum was very against the second marriage but he persisted. Long story short my teenage years was spent enduring this shit show. My dad finally got married and his son was born. 

Fast forward a few more years his second marriage doesn't seem to be working out. He sometimes brings his son over to our place, and I just stand there dumbfounded.

My wife was a bridesmaid in Stacey’s first wedding and the circumstances of how the marriage ended have been kept private (which I think is respectable).  I met Stacey a total of two times. Once, with her former husband at a wedding, and once at our wedding, with her now fiancé “John.”

I know they do not talk regularly because when the save the date came in, I asked my wife when she had talked to Stacey last. She said not really much other than an occasional text since our wedding. That was nearly 3 years ago. My wife then said she is going and really wants me to go with her. Her logic behind why is that Stacey and John came to our wedding and apparently helped significantly with setting up. I was out buying last minute things for the wedding like beer and wine, last minute catering things,etc. so I wasn’t part of the setup. 

Normally I would say yes, absolutely, but I didn’t really give her an answer. I did a “well let’s see when it gets closer “ move. Reason being: we just moved less than 6 months ago to a new state. Both of us have new jobs. She is taking an out of the country, 2 week trip this year and probably will be taking that time unpaid from her job.

However his new gf found out that there would be halal meat served, and she flipped her lid and demanded to me (My brother has been dating her 5 months... it was my first time that she’d be coming my place) that I don’t serve halal meat. I said dude, I’m specifically making 4 different dishes, one of which is a fish dish (fish is one of those weird things that is halal anyhow you prepare it so it doesn’t require a special prayer) and there’s 2 veggie mains as well as a host of sides that have 0 meat in them. The ONLY thing that was considered strictly halal was the lamb chops I made. 

She got my brother to call me and he threatened to boycott the dinner. My best friend was like dude just leave the meat, it’s cool, idc. I said I’m not disrespecting you like that in your own goddamn house, and besides, my mom and dad love the recipe and I’d already ordered the meat. 

I made the lamb chops, and I guess my mom threatened my bro because he and his girlfriend came anyway. My friend was very nice to her, however the entire time all she did was whine about how cruel halal slaughter is. 

My dad ended up getting pissed off and telling my bros girlfriend to pick a new topic, and then my brother snapped at my dad and he and his gf left. 

He’s now demanding I apologize since I started all this but frankly I think he and she should be the ones to apologize.",AITA for refusing to make my dinner non halal for my brothers girlfriend?

This happened about 20 minutes ago, so I figured I'd get it out while fresh.  
 

Some context: I'm getting married in four months. Both sets of parents are contributing financially to the wedding but have very different mindsets. My parents are very involved and (more so my Dad) very controlling and insistent on things being his way. My in-laws literally couldn't care less (in a good way) and would be fine with us eloping. Whereas pretty much every time we bring up a new wedding idea, my dad craps all over it.  
 

Initially my fiancé and I didn't want to have any sort of rehearsal; it seemed like a big waste of money. We essentially just wanted to have dinner with our parents and our wedding party. However, it was something that my parents were big on, and as they offered to pay and to help plan it, we decided to go for it.  
 

We both have pretty big families in town and have family coming in from out of town as well. As the wedding is getting closer, my dad was bugging me for a list of/contact info for my fiancé’s family so he could invite them. We decided to just have my fiancé’s mom do this because a) my dad is very abrasive b) it's easier than getting him a list and c) it lets my MIL be involved in a part of it, since my parents are doing pretty much everything. I told him he wouldn't be doing that part about a week ago.  
 

Cut to tonight: my dad tells me (doesn't ask me) that they'll be inviting my fiancé’s family, so would I please get him contact info. I said sorry, MIL is already taking care of it, it would be weird to invite them twice and we prefer it this way. He got really mad and was going off about how it's their duty as hosts to send the invites, how it will be so much harder on them to plan now, how this is super inconsiderate, and how we're taking this whole thing away from them (even played the ""well I'm paying for it"" card). My mom was more reasonable and basically said it would have been easier if they had done it but it really doesn't matter.  
 

It ended with me basically saying ""Sorry, I get it's important to you but we're doing it this way and honestly I don't care about your evite-etiquette opinions.""  
 

(I should mention that we've had consistent problems with him being rude, unsupportive, and also just super rude toward my fiancé our whole relationship).  
 

My fiancé agrees that he was being ridiculous and way more upset than was warranted, but now that things are calmer part of me thinks I should have just let them do it. So, what do you think, AITA?",AITA for not letting my parents invite my fiance's family to the rehearsal themselves?
94,AmItheAsshole,"My friends and I (all 23F) have gone on a handful of road trips/long distance drives over the past couple years. We always split gas and when necessary take turns driving. We were planning our trip for this summer and no one was particularly excited to drive.  It was brought up that I should be the one to drive since I'm the only one who hasn't driven - this will be a 18 hour drive each way. I have a couple reasons why I don’t offer to drive that I've been pretty vocal about each time we go on trips. 

1) My car is a manual and I'm the only one who knows how to drive it. When I got this car three years ago I offered to teach my friends to drive stick if they were ever interested, no one has been. My #1 concern is that this means I would need to drive the ENTIRE trip, and if I got hurt or something happened to me no one would be able to drive my car. Last year when a few of us were hiking I broke my wrist and my dad and sister had to come an hour to pick us up because I couldn't drive. 

2) I have the oldest car of the group, and it's had quite a few mechanical issues in the past year - my car's 2008, my friends all drive 2015 or newer. My car's already over 200k miles and I'm worried this would push it over the edge.  

3) I by far have the smallest car of the group. This is a 5 person camping trip, it would be uncomfortable for everyone if we had to cram in.

*I drive us my fair share when it's in our area. I like driving so when it's a trip to the grocery store or to a restaurant I have no problem doing it. 

I mentioned these reasons again, and I apologized a few times. Then I was told that I’m making excuses because I just don’t want to drive (??). Someone mentioned that since I won’t drive I should pay for a rental car (for our 9 day trip). I looked into it and it would be around $1100. I understand that these trips put a lot of mileage on cars, so I get the frustration, but I don’t know what I can really do in this situation. I countered with saying we should all split the rental car instead if no one would like to take their car. That was a hard no. People are upset, people are boycotting the trip, I feel like I'm ruining it. These are friends I've had since middle school, they're all reasonable people, so I feel like I'm missing something?? Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: The longest drive we've done before this one was 10 hours.",AITA for never driving my car for group trips?
95,AmItheAsshole,"I know the title sounds kinda bad, but hear me out. Also apologies for formatting because I’m on mobile.

My (19F) sister (18F) is disabled. Mentally, she’s all good, but she has a LOT of physical problems. One of the side affects is that she’s very short for her age (3’5” at the most I believe). When she goes out people will come up to her and honestly talk down to her. I can’t blame them since she does look very young for her age (she looks at the MOST 7 or 8). But still, it bothers me that they do that, and I’ve had conversations with her where she has said that it not only bothers her that people talk to her like she’s a child, but also that people just seem to feel like they have a right to approach her, call her ‘brave’, and have an honestly (in her eyes) demeaning conversation with her just to make themselves feel like a better person. 

Our mom has recently allowed us to go out by ourselves. She hasn’t done this before because my sister has in home &amp;amp; at school nurses almost constantly, and my mom is also a stay at home mom and registered nurse practitioner so when she doesn’t have a nurse my mom will stay with her. But I guess since we’re older my mom now feels comfortable leaving us alone. When we go out, people will approach her and say things that I can clearly see by her body language and the fact that I just know how she feels about these situations make her uncomfortable. Would it be an asshole move of me to ask those random strangers to leave us alone? After all, we’re both uncomfortable with it and I think it’s a little presumptuous on their part to assume that my sister wants to be talked to or told she’s ‘special’ when she really wants to be left alone.

Of course I wouldn’t immediately tell them to fuck off or anything. I would politely say “I’m sorry, but we’re trying to eat/shop/have a sister day/etc.” and just leave asap. I know this seems like a validation post and the answer seems obvious but it truly isn’t, because I genuinely don’t know if people would think I’m an asshole or not for this.",WIBTA if I started telling people off?
96,AmItheAsshole,"So, I work in an office with 15 other people who store food in the break room fridge. Once a week, one of us is asked to clean out the fridge. Today was my day. I begin going through and tossing out the trash and come across a little plastic container with a lid on it. There's no name on it so I pulled the lid back to find about a spoonful of what I think is soup and the inside of the container looks like it is starting to grow mold. Gross. So, I just toss it in the trash. Now, before anyone asks, the container was a cheapo container. Nothing special. Fast forward to quitting time. Mary comes up to me asking if I threw her container away. I tell her yes, and explain why. She tells me that I am a bully to an older woman and that I should replace her lunch and container. I apologise and tell her I will. I don't want anyone pissed off at me. Later, I find out the moldy container has been in the back of the fridge for a month. The others who've cleaned out the fridge left it there in hopes someone would claim it and take it home. I think Mary is a scammer.

97,AmItheAsshole,"My husband and I have a tradition of getting a few small gifts and one big gift for each other's birthdays.  Last year for his big gift, I decided to get him an exercise bike.  He suffered a pretty bad work accident 6 years ago that left him with a lot of arthritis and chronic pain, truly a shame considering he's only 29.  He always showed up and participated in physical therapy, but he hasn't needed it for a few years so he gets close to zero exercise now.  He also doesn't eat well at all; he is a very picky eater and  only really likes high carb, unhealthy foods that cause inflammation.  It bothers me a lot because I know he could feel so much better if he tried to be more mindful about eating foods that actually nourish him and got a little exercise, but he is severely depressed so he has a hard time motivating himself to make better choices.  He has bad back problems but I fully believe it's mostly due to being very sedentary.  He had expressed interest in having an exercise bike before, so I thought it was a considerate gift choice.  My mom pitched in so we could afford to get him a pretty nice one.  He has only used it once, and I recently found out that he thought it was a horrible gift and he felt really cheated out of his birthday because our big gifts ""should be thoughtful, personal gifts from each other"".  I told him I didn't mean any malice by the gift, I just hoped it might make him feel better physically.  I guess I can see where that could be perceived as a lame gift, but when I think of the past gifts he's gotten me I almost got mad about his reaction.  One year he got me a Nintendo Switch.  I wasn't bummed about it because I am a ""gamer"" in the capacity of adapting to enjoying it because it is a major hobby of his, but I also work a lot and VERY rarely have time for video games.  Meanwhile, he has purchased 5+ games on the switch and plays it all the time to where it feels like it was a gift to himself disguised as a gift to me.  I wouldn't care about that if it weren't for his reaction to the bike and how he made me feel so bad about getting him a lame gift.

98,AmItheAsshole,"Over the past few years, I was really struggling with my mental health. I was unmotivated, depressed, extremely anxious, and having bursts of anger. 
So a few months ago, I decided it was finally time to seek outside help. Which brings me to the therapist.

(I have since been diagnosed with ADHD and a mood disorder- not by the therapist)

At the end of my first session with the therapist, I was bothered when they forced me to hug them at the end and said “you’ll get used to it”. I’m not comfortable with physical touch.

I kept going to the sessions bc 1. I wanted to give them a chance and 2. I was finally getting help and did not want to deny myself an opportunity to feel better.

So 2 months go by and I consistently go to my weekly session. Eventually my sessions were only doing the biofeedback, even though I wanted and needed talk therapy. 
They also arrived 15 minutes late to a session (without any notification) AND during my last few sessions, they  spent 10-15 minutes of my time complaining about their own problems.
My copay was $45 per session, so I did not appreciate that. (2months cost me $360)

Here’s the present problem:
I recently started school, and due to requirements, had to change my session time/day.
The last time I saw them (~3 weeks ago) I told them I would like to change days and they responded along the lines of “ I am sure I have another availability, I’ll get back to you on that”. 
A few days later, I text them to see if they looked at the schedule—- no response

The next week I got the confirmation text for the appointment on Tuesday, I immediately texted them to remind them I can’t make it and that I’d still like to find another session time that works. —— no response.

The same thing happened last week, automated call and my text response, asking for their available times—- NO RESPONSE

This week I got no text reminder, which seems like they removed me from their schedule.I text them 1 final time saying I wanted to keep seeing them and to please let me know what availability they have. —— no freaking response

I have still yet to hear from them. 
No discharge summary or reason.
Luckily, I have been on some medicine that has really helped me (thanks to an NP, not the therapist). But I have to be honest, this hurts. Guess you could say I was ghosted by my therapist. 

I really don’t like the idea of putting  someone’s job or livelihood in jeopardy. But I also don’t want anyone else to experience this, especially if they are emotionally or mentally vulnerable.

I also feel like I spent almost $400 for mental health services, that did nothing for me. Again, I am 24 and in school, so budgeting that money for therapy was difficult, but at the time I thought it was a necessary expense. Now I need to find a new provider, which can take months. 

Important notes: 
- I work in providing healthcare services (all I’m comfortable saying), so I am familiar with ethic guidelines and appropriate provider-to-client relationships.

My GF and I have been together for 4 years now, since we were both in grade 8, as I’m getting older my father who was never really apart of my life other than giving me money for christmas and nothing else. recently he decides I should be more involved in his life and my siblings lives as well. My siblings agree with him, saying I’m a “terrible son” or “shouldn’t have turned my back on family” or that I need to be with them more.

But I feel mistreated because I don't have control over who gets to know about my very own flaws (it will likely be spread to her whole family).

So I’m (24F) getting married in May and have raised the idea that my older brother (30M) maybe shouldn’t come. The reason is I’d like to have just one day where I can see my extended family and friends without them oohing and aahing over my brother. We live in a really small town in Georgia, part of a minority community (Viet-American) and my brother has always been semi-famous because of his accomplishments. 

He went to Stanford then Harvard and then went to work on Wall Street. Now he’s at a big investment bank but goes on global tv every week to talk about finance and markets etc. He’s not really that impressive by real world standards but he’s an absolute god in our small, lower class town where I still live with my fiancé. 

Every time he visits our neighbors or family friends will act like he’s the messiah himself. Everyone can’t get enough of the fact that he’s “made it” despite coming from humble roots. I’m happy for him but being in his shadow for so long has made me bitter at always being second best. 

I’ve raised the idea of possibly not inviting him to my wedding to my parents and they were absolutely against it. I’d just like one day where I could feel like me and my fiancé are the center of attention and I KNOW if he attends it will be all about him again. AITA for wanting to go forward with this?

As the meal went on, she added a second latte and 2 pancakes, never even blinked in my general direction before placing these additional orders.

103,AmItheAsshole,"I’m an introvert, alway have been. I’ve had casual friendships throughout school and uni but I’ve never allowed myself to form very close bonds with people. I’m the type that dreads being invited to nights out and social events but will always try to push myself to go out. Somehow, I never seem awkward and will make the effort to have a laugh with everyone (all the while, desperately wishing to go home and needing a day to ‘recover’ from mental exhaustion). After uni, I gradually drifted apart from everyone and spent most of my time in my own company or with family. I work but avoid socialising with colleagues outside the office - just exchange pleasantries or general chit chat. I’m not depressed, I’m just comfortable living this way.

I’ve been with my fiance for 2 years. He’s a very social person. He’s got a large group of friends he talks with regularly and a few best friends he sees a lot. I’m really happy for him to enjoy his time with mates but he notices my mood slightly drop when I also get invited along. I know it’s not fair to make him meet up with them on his own all the time so 90% of the time I join him. I never complain to him and try to hide my anxiety but he can often catch my nerves and desire to be elsewhere. I honestly don’t know why he wants to marry me sometimes.

So, my fiance wants a big traditional wedding and I just want something small in a registry office with dinner and drinks after. I’m embarrassed and terrified for a few reasons; I don’t really have many friends I can invite. I have no one to ask to be a bridesmaid without it looking like a desperate spot-filler. I dread and loath attention. Most of my relatives live abroad and can’t afford to come. All I can do is bump up my numbers with my family’s friends or co-workers who I’m not close to. The other thing is, my fiance wants all the trimmings like flowers, colour themes and decorations, vintage car, photographer, a dj, fun party activities, etc. but he wants me to basically choose and organise all these things. I’ve sat him down a few times and tried to explain how much I dislike weddings in general, especially the traditional kind and am really struggling to do all the things he desires. He makes a sad face and I just end up giving in. Now he’s enlisted a bunch of his girl mates to help motivate me and organise things and they’re also planning a bachelorette party. I feel so pathetic and angry at myself for being the way I am and not sucking it up for a while to make others happy but I honestly can’t bring myself to feel so humiliated and anxious.

104,AmItheAsshole,"So I (35f, if that's relevant idk) live with my husband in an apartment complex. We have a neighbor, she is very old (like easily 80, may be more) and weak. Her son and daughter in law live next door, and she lives with a full time nurse at home. 


Now old people aren't generally good with technology. Her son bought her a smart phone recently. Now, son and daughter in law work full time, so if she needs help with the phone, she can't contact them, so she asks me. (Her full time nurse comes over to my house to call me, and I go to her place to help her out.)

Now, I have never once not helped her. It's always simple stuff like forwarding an image on Whatsapp, or sending a text msg, or switching off the silent mode cause she accidentally turned it on...


Every time I have tried to teach her how to use Whatsapp. She insisted that I write each step in a notebook, so she doesn't have to bother me again. I thought it was sweet actually. So I wrote everything in detail, asked her to read it back so I could make sure she understands my handwriting. I made her send 2-3 msgs on her own also for practice. But I know, at this age, she would have forgotten it by evening. 

Her full time nurse is just as clueless when it comes to using smart phones, I have tried to teach her, but she just gives up saying, ""no no ... I dont understand it...I am scared of big phones..""

So every 3rd day, I have her on my door step asking me to come over and help with the phone. I work from home, so I am always available. But it's not like I am free to go over every time. Once I was in a meeting over Skype, and my bell rang. I excused myself, answered the door and there she was. I politely told her that I can't come over right now. May be in another half hour or so. She left, but exactly half hour later, she rang the door bell again. My meeting wasn't over, so I told her again that I am occupied right now, I will come over as soon as I am free. Some time goes by and she came in again!! I was extremely annoyed but didn't show it. Anyway, my meeting had just ended, I went over to see what was the problem. She wanted to know how to forward images to a contact. Actually, she wanted me to send it on my own, cause she just can't grasp the concept of doing it. 

I know that she can't help it. I know that she is not trying to disrupt my afternoon, she just wants help navigating the phone. If anything, I am a little annoyed at her son for getting her a smart phone, cause she cannot understand how to use it. She has a normal phone to make calls. This phone is just for Whatsapp etc. 

I have never denied help, I always go, put on my best smile and help her. But from within I am extremely annoyed. Honestly, I feel very old people should not have technology they cannot understand, and simply cannot learn.

105,AmItheAsshole,"Hi Reddit, this only happened yesterday and I need some neutral opinion on this. Also not a native English-speaker, so please forgive my spelling mistakes.

The problem: My best friend (20,f) and I (20,f) used to go to the same Highschool. Almost immediatly after we met, we became best friends. She played a big part in escaping my depression and making me a more confident, Self-loving person. We did everything together and lived through every milestone one encounters between 16 to 20. We both don´t really have any other good friends, which made our friendship even stronger. After she left the school before the last year started, we still saw each other at least twice a week and went partying every weekend. I told her all of my secrets and problems and in return, so did she.

Last week a friend from my old High-School ( I graduated in 2019)  asked me to go on a last-minute ski trip with her and her new boyfriend. I said yes and send her the money so she could book the hotel. Then she told me another guy  from our old school (Miles) would also tag along, as well as another girl. In the end, that other girl got sick, so it was just the four of us.

My BFF used to have the biggest crush on Miles, but they never dated and he never made any indication that he would want to. They still hung out a lot as friends. After she left the school, contact broke off completly between them (2017),  and they only saw each other once more a year later, when they had a random drunken hook-up (no sex tho) . After that, again no contact. We never talked about him after that, so I thought she wasn´t into him anymore and tbh, I always liked Miles as a friend, but we had really opposite personalities and I was never that close with him.

After I told her of the planned vacation, she seemed fine. The only thing she said was that it could seem like a couples vacation, to which I assured her it wasn´t. The day after, she stopped responding to my messages and didn´t answer my calls. I repeatedly asked her if there was something wrong, but the the trip started and I wanted to have a good time, so I just left it at that. After I came back, she texted me that I broke her trust, our friendship is a burden to her and that she can´t understand  how I could go on vacation with her ex (he´s not!)

I feel like I haven´t done anything wrong, for me it was just a vacation with friends. I would´ve invited her, but it was really last-minute and the other girl and her don´t like each other that much. Even if she had said something beforehand, I probably still would have gone. I understand that she may still have feelings for him, but she never mentioned it in 2 years and she didn´t say anything when I told her about the trip .

106,AmItheAsshole,"A little background story: I (27F) was working a shift at the hospital and I was charge nurse that shift. Coworker (40sM) - we will call him John, was also working that shift as a nurse. We are both psych nurses.

John has a reputation that he doesn't do anything at work except be on his phone, hide in the back office and watch videos whether it's on the computer or on his phone. He would delegate tasks to his peers just because he simply, ""doesn't feel like doing it.""

On that particular day, a patient had come up to the desk at 1:30pm and asked John (who at the time was on his phone) if he could shave. Shaves have to be supervised on the unit - and there are no set times. So, John looks at the patient and said, ""no, it's too late. You can shave tomorrow."" The patient walked away and I looked at John and said, ""seriously?"" So he replies with, ""what?"" I asked him why he couldn't do it? He said that he ""was about to go on break."" But then I pointed out that he was clearly not doing anything right now but scrolling on his phone. He replied with, ""you can do it, I just don't want to do it."" 

At this point, I am LIVID. I wasn't mad about the fact that he was going on break, but he basically brushed the patient off. He could have asked any of the staff to do it. But his reply right off to the bat was that ""it was too late."" So I go in the back office and I file an incident report for conduct. 

He gets pulled into the office later in the shift by our manager and I guess they spoke about it. I go back to work a couple days later and hear from my peers that he was bad mouthing me to the rest of our coworkers.

So, this is kind of a long story (and I never intended to post this)
I moved out with my parents when I was 16, moved into some sort of foster home and got thrown out at roughly 18. As I was in a city that I didn‘t know (lived in a small village my entire life) I heavily depended on my friends. I had some money stacked away for emergencies and hopefully an apartment. I had a lot going on during this time - I tried to receive help from several government agencies and employees, but since I was so young they couldn‘t do anything. Since I had no place to stay at, I crashed at my boyfriend‘s place sometimes and other times just with some friends, until one of my friends invited me to stay at her garden house (more like a summer house). It was highly illegal to live there and I needed to hide when police patrolled - that‘s kind of the legal situation I‘m talking about. I was so thankful to her and her dad, who owned the place - invited them to eat and have a few drinks several times (legal drinking age is 18), helped out in the garden (which they did nothing for in years - and I thought that her dad might want to sell it someday as he was not using it, so I might as well do all the work to make it look presentable). It was great for a month, and you can believe me, I‘m not a choosing beggar. I spent all of my money to make it up to them somehow, and that was not much since I did have nothing. One day, they told me to move out (didn‘t tell me a date) and suddenly stopped talking to me. I moved away all my stuff with my boyfriend‘s help in a day and spent the evening cleaning. As a thanks for all they have done for me, I left them some of my utensils that my friend has told me she needed. (Pans, pots, that stuff, that was like all I owned) 

Fast forward, after a few difficult months of not having a roof over my head and having to stay at my social worker‘s place, a mutual friend asks me if it was true that I used the girl for all of her money, never thanked them and never had time to do stuff with her. (e.g. shopping, travels and stuff) How was I supposed to do that? I‘m wondering that maybe I did not do enough to thank them, but I had mental health issues my entire life and was way too devastated after losing my home to think about parties and this crap. (Also, finances) But still - I did live there when I had no options and they were very kind to me. I‘m not sure if I am the asshole here or they are. 

Oh, and if you‘d like to know: I‘m better now, have a stable income and an apartment.",AITA for skipping out on social activities while being homeless?
109,AmItheAsshole,"New here, so please excuse me if i'm not as polished as others. 

 We currently have an 11 yr old Lab, and 6 mo old Lab, on 3 fully fenced acres, and I am a SAHM of two kiddos.  3 Months ago my husband agreed we could take in my mother's dog ( 9 mo old GSD) for a few weeks while she was recovering from being sick. 

 If my mother was unable to take the dog back after a few weeks, we agreed to give it back to the breeder for re-homing. 

3 months have passed, dog is part of the pack gets along with kids, plays all day with the puppy lab, and I've grown attached. He  peeks in the kitchen window while I do dishes, just to say ""Hello"" and just makes me giggle and laugh. He is very sweet and lovable, not to mention barks to alert me when someone's around (labs are snoozing), checks on the kids and is basically a dream GSD that I grew up with (attached...). 

Husband doesn't want a third dog or even a 2nd once the old guy goes :'(  Husband says he feels betrayed like I baited and switched, lied to him in not keeping my promise. He has threatened to take the dog to a shelter, or worse if I don't agree to give him up dispatch him. Tonight he ""took it there"" and told me to choose him or the dog.  

Husband is notoriously stubborn, and I just don't understand why he can't see the dog makes me happy and brings me joy.  It's not a financial burden to take on the dog, he is now part of our pack (other than my husband not being a fan. )

I should also add husband works out of the home with a long commute so is gone 10+ hr day, doesn't take care of the animals (never picked up dog poop a day in his life), doesn't feed, or procure food for dogs or keep up with vet or other care (baths nail clipping etc). it's all me.

110,AmItheAsshole,"Hi. I'm a long time lurker and first time poster, who has just created this account to post on here. I'm sorry if the title is a bit confusing but here it goes:

My family owns a small business and I [at the time 18] had been looking for a job for the longest time, however got rejected every single time for the same reason: no experience. 
One day my uncle offered me a job at his business, but said that my pay would be 7.50€/hour. That is about 2€ less than minimum wage in the country where I am from, but I accepted his offer since I was desperately looking for a job. 
Initially, I was only supposed to work Saturdays because I had school during the week, then it progressed to Saturday and Sunday and lastly, I got called into work once or twice during the week too.
Because of me working a lot more than planned, I had brought up the money subject before and asked to be paid minimum wage, however I got told that since food and drinks are free for me, I don't necessarily deserve the 2€ more. 
Now, about 1 1/2 years later, I told my uncle and my aunt I would have to stop working due to me having to focus on my upcoming finals and moving abroad for university soon.
About a week later, my aunt told me and my mum she's looking for someone to replace me and wants/has to pay them minimum wage (~9.50€/hour).

I feel like that's really unfair, since the replacement is literally going to do my work but gets more money than me. 

So, would I be the asshole if I calculated an average amount of hours I have worked in the month for the past 18 months and multiplied this by 2 and then demanded that money from my uncle and aunt? 

(e.g. 30 hours/month * 18 months = 540 hours, 540h * 2€ = 1080€)

Edit: this is just a rough estimate, there were months during school breaks that I worked about 30 hours / a week, so I guess the total sum would be a bit more. 

I am really sorry if this is all over the place / hard to understand. Also, English is not my native language so I apologise for any mistakes. Thank you in advance.",WIBTA if I asked for the money that I am basically owed?

I’ve had 2 horrible long distance relationships before which he knew so these few weeks have been pretty rough for me. We have had a lot of struggles over this break but we have both acknowledged and tried to openly communicate knowing when we get back it will be easier. The 13 hour time difference made talking even more difficult as I was in class during most times he was awake. Anyways, I got in town yesterday and he gets in today, though we had always planned on seeing each other tomorrow, I suggested we see each other today. He said no because one of his best friends lives near the airport so his other best friend (and roomate) is going to take the subway to friend 1’s place and the three of them are going to chill there so he can relax after he gets off his 2 hour flight. I understand that’s cute his friends planned this, they are investment bankers so my bf doesn’t get to spend much time with his roomate/ best friend during the week, however his friends literally came to visit him in his home state for 3 days over the past weekend (MLK).

113,AmItheAsshole,"Hello everyone, I’m not a native English speaker so I’d like to apologize for any mistakes.

So earlier today I was going to the shops to get some groceries. I was texting my girlfriend (Amy) as I was leaving my apartment and I mentioned to her that I’m gonna go to the shops. She then asked me if I could get some stuff for her and her friend, I said sure no problem. Amy is staying in her friend’s apartment for a few days, and her friend’s apartment is in the building right across the street from mine. And I don’t know if this is relevant but her friend is also kinda my friend.

So anyway I got my stuff and the stuff they asked for and left the shop. The shop is only one block away from our buildings so I walked back and when I was about to get there I texted my girlfriend to come down and get their things. I would’ve went up and gave it to them at their apartment door but you need a keycard to access the building so I couldn’t do that. She then replied to my text telling me to just give them to the security guard and that they’ll come down to get them later. Now this kinda offended me a little bit.. and I texted back saying that she could come down and take them now or I’ll take them home with me (which is like a 2 minute walk away from where they are) and they can come get them whenever. She didn’t reply, so I called, and she didn’t answer, so I texted again and said ok then, they’ll be at my apartment if you wanna come pick them up. 

A few minutes later she replies to my texts saying that I’m being super dramatic and that I could’ve just left them with the security guard and that it’s no big deal. I explained to her that I really didn’t appreciate that she asked me to get them things and then when I did get them she wouldn’t even come down and take them from me. She got really mad at me for “creating problems out of nothing”, and that she didn’t reply to me because she was watching something and her phone was on mute, which I understand, I’m not the kind of person that takes late replies personally. But now she’s mad at me and she’s adamant that I’m being over dramatic even though I really didn’t fight with her about it or anything, all I did was take the groceries with me to my apartment and I didn’t make any fuss about it, I just told her that I found her request a little offensive.

114,AmItheAsshole,"Hey guys. I suck at writing, but I’ll try my best.
I was in a classroom at my school, alone, preparing a presentation for my final on my laptop. The tables were set up in long rows with chairs on both sides, and I was facing the back wall of the room in the second to last row. 

Two people entered the room. They work at the school and I had helped them out a few times, but they were not professors. However, I rarely saw one of them (let's call her Girl 1) because of our schedules and didn't know her very well. Girl 1 and I had a few conversations in the past, but I would not consider us friends. I was not friends with Girl 2 either, but I had helped her more frequently. 

They went to the back of the room near where I was, talking about something. I was facing them, but I was maybe 10 feet away with another table between us. They glanced at me but did not acknowledge me otherwise. They were talking quietly. I thought nothing of it since there’s supplies over there they may have needed. 

I could hear them from my table but tried to tune the conversation out. Then, Girl 1 began to talk about serious and personal topics like her divorce, bad relationship, etc. in detail. The conversation was louder now but not shouting or anything. She became emotional and started crying while Girl 2 listened and tried to comfort her. This went on for a bit (~8-10 min). It was a weird place to have a serious conversation because it's a pretty open room. 

I started feeling uncomfortable about the situation because it felt like I was not supposed to be hearing this. I also really needed to finish my project. I decided to try and slip out of the room at this point. But, Girl 1 did not like that. She asked, “Am I bothering you??”

 I said “No, I just didn’t want to intrude on your personal conversation” 

She said loudly “If I didn’t want you to hear we would have been talking somewhere else!”

I cook, clean, look after the children and work from home, while Ken and my husband *play video games* I clean up after the animals, do all the DIY and gardening.

Ken is impulsive, we now have three dogs, seven rabbits and five cats because he got them and then got bored.

So it's just me looking after *everything* and I know if I got ill, which has happened, everything would go to hell, so being sick isn't even an option.

Ken will scream and shout if he doesn't get his own way, I accidentally put beans on his chips and he threw the plate at a wall.

Dropped 2pints of milk? He called me ""*fucking stupid*""

I even do his washing and ironing.

I've had *enough*, my own baby (4) has started to put her hands on her hips when talking to me, telling me what I can or can't do, she's a kid but the facial expressions are *all Ken*

116,AmItheAsshole,"My aunt is getting married soon (congrats). She plans to have the wedding this year. It's still in the early planning stages.

I have an outside-of-school competition this year. I don't know the exact dates of the competition, but I know it's on a certain month. It would be my first, and competitions like this are a good opportunity for my future.

Here is the problem. I don't want her to plan the wedding on the dates of my competition, because then I would either miss the competition or the wedding, and that would be sad.

My family has a history of accidentally coincidentally scheduling family events on the same dates as my outside-of-school events. That's why this one would be my first, because I wasn't able to attend my last one.

Of course, the event is hers and her fiance's plans alone, and I accept whatever decision they make for the wedding. But I feel that it would be selfish of me to interfere with their potential plans. Plus, I don't know the exact date of my competition yet, because it's yet to be announced.

I told (only) my parents about my upcoming competition already, and they let me join. But I haven't told them about my worry about the competition being on the same date as my aunt's wedding. Nobody else in my family knows about my event except for my parents.

118,AmItheAsshole,"I split with my ex about 5 years ago. We have a 10 year old son and I have a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship. 

The breakup was pretty ugly- I was diagnosed with PTSD from domestic violence. We agreed my son would spend 2 nights a week on weekends at his father's house and live with me during the week. The agreement stated that he would pick him up on Fridays from school and I would collect him on Sundays.

Over the last few years, my ex has repeatedly told my son that eventually we will be a family again, bad mouthed both myself, my daughter and my current partner to him and been verbally abusive towards me. There are long standing concerns regarding my son's welfare when in my exes care, as he drinks heavily, does not work and often says he has no money, food, petrol, etc. His house is also filthy and my son has told us he cannot shower there as the plumbing is broken. He comes home smelling and looking filthy. 

Recently, the relationship between my son and his father has deteriorated and my son is spending less and less weekends with him. My ex has started refusing to pick him up and is instead sending messages demanding I bring my son to him and provide food and clothing for him for while he is there as he cannot afford them. His messages have become increasingly abusive.

I refuse to do this. I work full time, so dropping him off means travelling more than an hour after work each Friday. It also states in our custody agreement that my ex is responsible for providing for our son when he is in his care. 

It has now been 27 days since my son last saw his father. I have been told by some family members that I am wrong to not be doing more to ensure my son can see him and that all boys deserve to have a father.

121,AmItheAsshole,"I went and saw a therapist that my insurance would cover because I was having difficulties with anxiety and managing my relationships in my life. The goal was to speak to a professional who could get down to the nitty-gritty of my life and help me realize why I may have unhealthy coping mechanisms or why I experience life the way I do. I have a lot of bottled up trauma from my childhood that I don't believe I've ever let go, and I think this follows me a lot in life. Yet, I'm not sure how it may manifest and wanted an opinion and also some help from a trusted professional. 

They have me fill out a packet that asks me a lot of questions about my emotions and the way I feel everyday. I filled it out to the best of my ability and was set up with a therapist. From the sheet, she diagnosed me with chronic severe anxiety and chronic depression. She asked me, does this feel applicable to you?

I said, the anxiety, yes. I do not feel depressed. I am eager and optimistic about life. I didn't agree with that diagnosis but she told me that it was just there because I fit some of the criteria. So, she started just talking to me about my anxiety and how I can cope with it, like counting slowly and forcing myself to calm down, basically. She sets me up an appointment with a psychiatrist and that was my first visit done with. 

I go to a psychiatrist and wait an hour to be seen. I go into a room and some woman who has never talked to me ever and is only going off a diagnosis for anxiety and depression prescribes me Prozac. I go, okay, maybe this will help. It made me miserable and actually depressed. She urged me to keep taking it so I actually get the effects but after a month, I couldn't stand it, so I stopped.

Second therapy appointment with the therapist and she asks me if I got my medication and how my anxiety has been doing. I say it's a little difficult because sometimes I will think about my childhood and have a panic attack which Prozac does not fix nor does counting to 5. I was trying to start engaging conversation about my childhood and life, but all she does was nod and go ""mhm, well, try and remember to take deep breaths while this is happening.""

She suggested I try and take a different medication but I can't get booked with the psychiatrist until 3 months later. I thought in my head, this isn't working. It's like they want to shove pills down my throat. I walked out and never came back. 

I kept receiving letters from the therapist that were pretty condescending. One states, ""[Op], since you have not returned any of my letters, I am going to assume you are all better and do not need help anymore. I will be taking you off our list."" Other letters state, ""you can not get better without our help. Please come back.""

My younger sister (32) has another wedding she is attending on Oct 17 overseas. When I called to chat about the dates she told me that she needed to keep the 10th, 17th and 24th open. She’s not sure when her travel dates will be, and she hasn’t booked anything yet. She wants us to keep those open in case the airfare is cheaper. (By a few $$$)

I’ve spoken to my mom about this, and her solution is to pencil in Oct 10, Oct 24 and Oct 31 as possible wedding dates, to wait two months until my sister books her vacation, and then to pick our dates.

my boyfriend (25) loves my daughter, he spends time with us, buys her things, and treats her good. we have only been together for about 5 months so we haven’t moved in together, but things are getting pretty serious. i adore my boyfriend, but i’ve always had trouble trusting men. my father was never around and i had a step-dad growing up who did inappropriate things to me (i think you can guess what) so this all makes it harder for me. 

my boyfriend was excited about all of it, he kept asking about the babysitting arrangements i made, but i always dodged the question. i told him last friday because that’s the day i left for the trip and he went on to rant about how i didn’t trust him and that i’m an asshole for leaving my daughter with someone else. i told him that i wasn’t leaving her with strangers, that she was with family, but this made him even more angrier and he said that i was implying that he was a stranger (i wasn’t). 
it totally ruined my the rest of my trip, but once i came back, it got even worse. he tried to make it seem like he was over it, but i can tell he’s not. he makes passive aggressive remarks about it whenever he can, i tried moving on, but he keeps bringing it up.

127,AmItheAsshole,"I've been a teacher for almost 10 years for an awesome school district. Part of the reason why I wanted to go into teaching was because school provided the only sanctuary I had in a dysfunctional family life. I started out working as a TA while going to school full-time, then a sub and finally got hired. I had to really put work in. It's not easy to get hired at this school district because the competition is fierce. Whenever we open a teaching job up, we literally get hundreds of applications. Hundreds.

During high school and the first two years of college, I had a friend named Russell. Long story short, he grew up privileged and was insensitive and critical of those who were not. For example, I could not afford to go to a four-year school and had to go to a ghetto community college. I worked full-time to pay for tuition and took six buses a day (two to get to school, two to get to work and if I got lucky, two to get back home). Russell, on the other hand, had parents who took care of his tuition and bought him a car and covered all of his expenses. Yet, he was the one who complained about everything and judged people for everything. Our friendship ended after he seriously told me that he considered himself a good person for being friends with someone like me (he looked down on me because of my challenges and lack of support).

15 years later, I was asked to partake in a final panel interview round for a teaching job at my school. One of the finalists is Russell. I opted to pretend like I didn't know him, but he ""outed"" me. I grilled him in the interview to assess whether or not he was still the same privileged Russell. For example, I told him we have kids who come from very wealthy families and other kids who live in trailers and what his teaching approach would be working in an economically diverse environment. Based on his answers, the suit he wore and the car he was driving, it felt like he was still the same ole entitled Russell so I torpedoed his employment prospects. Because I knew him, I was worried that he would not know how to teach or would feel that these poor kids were not equal or deserved the same level of instruction. Basically, Russell is an entitled asshole and I know that because I know him.

Some people might say that I should have been impartial or not have participated in the interview to ensure every one got a fair shot. But the reality is that nothing in life is fair. If someone cuts you off and flicks you off in traffic and it's the same person interviewing to be your co-worker, then you're not likely to endorse them. I don't care what anyone says; everyone is prejudice.

Edit: The point about his outing me as his ""friend"" rubbed me the wrong way more than what I already knew about him. It was clear he was trying to play the ""friend"" card with me because he felt like he should get any advantage available. That entitlement mentality is why I sunk his chances.",AITA for passing on a former friend was a final candidate for a job?

So basically i have been work @ a job i absolutely love. Things were/are pretty great don't dread waking up for work until now. So my coworker who sat behind me made rude and sexually suggestive comments pretty much all day every day. Had no issues being condescending but first saying hoping i am not being rude here(insert rude comment). Calling female coworkers babe (even after they asked him to stop and reported it to managers) so recently he made a comment about another coworker and sleeping with him and said that would mean he was gay. the coworker and then said ""oh gay and sleeping with the other co-worker how low is that of me"" (referring to himself.) When it was brought to HR i told the truth and answered all questions without trying to throw him under the bus (though i wanted to). So the investigation is done two weeks later he is fired (they had pulled his emails chat logs etc. and found a mountain of issues documented.and is now talking crap to coworker clients etc. My team has gone from friendly to cold except 2 people and most of his cronies on our team blame me for getting him fired.

My girlfriend pushes me to go to the gym but its kind of in nasty way. Calls me chubby, pinches fat time to time. I told her that I had a business lunch and her response was that I need to cut the alcohol out and theres a reason her coworkers refer to me as a beer keg.

I live in an apartment building. These college aged girls live in my building. If it matters the overwhelmingly vast majority of people here are families or elderly. 

Almost every other weekend since the beginning of the summer the girl will scream in the parking lot at 1am when coming back from the bar waking everyone up in the process. I would say 4 or 5 times I’ve found white claw cans on the front lawn of the building the morning after they go out. 

They often have people over after the bar and it can get loud. 

I haven’t knocked on their door to say something but a few weekends ago I leaned out my window be quiet when they were SCREAMING in the parking lot at 3am and they just cursed at me and told me to fuck off. I’m absolutely sick of this at this point. While it didn’t used to be every weekend it’s been every Saturday since the New Year and I can’t stand it.

We do our shopping and get to the self checkout, both in good moods. I notice he’s wincing when pushing the buttons and he says “I hurt my fingers playing guitar” we both laugh and I say “is that what the blood was from?” 

He immediately goes silent. I finish the checking out and we walk back to the car still silent. 

When we’re in the car I say “Are you okay?” And he initially says no, then he blows up at me for mentioning blood in public like that. As far as he’s concerned it’s like if he’d loudly asked me “What was all that piss in the bathroom?” 

I say that I thought it was totally different, and I didn’t know he thought discussions about blood were just as personal / uncomfortable as piss or something similar. 

I apologise but he doesn’t really accept that, or me saying that I didn’t know he’d interpret it that way. He is flabbergasted that I didn’t know. He said he didn’t like that people could have been listening in and judging us. I disagree, and also I said it quite quietly.

132,AmItheAsshole,"Backstory:

My GF (30F) and I (34M) have been dating almost 4 years now. When I met her, she was in financially dire straights that I was not aware of until much later in the relationship.

Basically, I found out (very embarassing for her) she had about 50k of debt from student debt and some bad choices she made in past. Her credit rating was also very bad. She had 2 payday loans out barely keeping her head above water. She moved in with me and I gave her 6 months free rent to sort out some of her higher interest debt and get back on her feet and to cut both our living costs.

Her parents live in Ontario, we live in BC so we travel back and forth often and her credit card awards her travel points for purchases and companion discount every year. She got a second card for a second companion discount. All her friends are getting married now and so the last couple of years we have gone back several times. Flying across Canada isn't cheap, usually costs $600-1000/person round trip so it adds up.

The issue:

Our friends have their wedding in Portugal this year. My GF is excited to go and has been talking about making a Euro trip of it. We went out for dinner one night and she stopped and said, ""Hey, can we talk about Portugal?"", after agreeing she asked me what I want to check out in Europe and all I could do was think about how much it was going to cost us and how much it was going to set us back on some of our goals. Plus, Europe isn't on my bucket list for places to travel, so the idea doesn't really excite me.

After not giving much input she got frustrated with me and then I told her I never really cared for a Euro trip and talking about it makes me anxious that we are wasting money that can be spent elsewhere. We didn't talk much for the rest of dinner. When we got home, I asked her how much she thought it was going to cost and she gave me her estimate, after checking things out the amount came out to over double her estimate. When we were breaking it down she got more upset and said, ""At this rate, we are never going to be able to spend time together making memories and experience things because all you care about is paying off debt. By the time you will be comfortable doing these things we are going to be old, sick, and dying to the point where we won't be able to enjoy them as much as we could now!"" I understand her point. I told her that I don't think we should go to the wedding at all and skip this one and do something more local instead for vacation.

I know shes upset, but shes is saying this while I (who is debt free) am trying to put money away for a ring, wedding, maybe a home for our future family. I also see that if we deal with the debt for another two years we will be in a much better position to be able to do things like this more regularly in parallel while saving for life goals.

133,AmItheAsshole,"Hey all, so I’ve been thinking about this scenario for some time as it already happened and I’m not sure if my response was right.

Context: I *had* :( a gf for about 2-3 months before we broke up because she didn’t want anything serious. It was pretty stupid as I was fully committed and was broken down pretty bad when she announced our split. My friend lets call ‘Kyle’ and my ex gf ‘Karen’. So Kyle and GOD DAMN KAREN were already good friends before I came in, so in and out they were always chatting each other up from time to time. Now KYLE THE LOUD MOUTH has pretty good social skills I must say, but he will literally talk about anything just to strike up a convo with you. Literally. “Oh, u/Reddit-Demi-God so how have u been with KAREN lately?” (After the split) Me: ...Bruh. Also, this is a high school scenario and Karen and I didn’t leave on good terms.

The Scenario: So my friend Kyle and I always hang out in the library to read books and talk about business (yea I’m a nerd, sue me). And somehow I don’t know how, like It was just 100% coincidence like there was no way it could’ve happened unless someone brought it up??!!! My relationship with Karen is now the topic of the convo. Now, we’re kind of close Kyle and I, but only when I vent about things. So we talk yap yap and then he tells me that he asked Karen why she broke up with the Demi-God himself and she just says “Why can’t I”. He literally asked her that without my permission just to strike up a convo with her, well knowing that we didn’t leave on good terms. So I responded, whatever she’s the past now. Then it happens a second time and this time she gets a little frustrated that Kyle keeps bringing me up so now she’s mad at me? To the point where she would 100% ignore my existence. I gave a speech to my class willingly one time and I could see that she was trying to look away. Shame. 

My Response: At first I was annoyed that he kept on mentioning me to my ex which caused her to hate me more, even when I’ve done nothing wrong and it wasn’t my fault. Then I weighed the losses and my initial thought was that my friendship with Kyle is more valuable than with Karen because I don’t even talk to Karen, and Kyle is my only library buddy so would I rather brush it off and still have a library buddy or tell Kyle off and put a dent in the friendship? I decided to keep my mouth shut and continue reading, but from the back of my mind for the rest of the day I wondered why the hell would he do such a thing?

Regardless, if Kyle mentions me to Karen again I’d tell him that the topic is private and he shouldn’t be discussing it so directly. So, I’m stuck in with a fork in the road. Oh wise redditors, WIBTA?

We went to see an R rated movie and where I live you have to be 17 or older to see it alone otherwise you need to have someone older than 25 with you. 

The movie starts and about 20 minutes in a group of 6 teens walk in. The theater isn’t that dark so I can clearly see that they’re all under 17. 

Normally I wouldn’t care if teenagers were at R movies. However as soon as they walked in they were giggling among themselves and whispering loudly. I figured they would settle down so I ignored it. 

They sat in the row in front of us and cue the most obnoxious behavior I’ve ever seen at a movie theater. They were talking amongst themselves, not whispering, talking. A few of them were texting, some of them were showing each other stuff on their phones, they weren’t even attempting to be discreet while opening their snack packages, etc. 

I’m not the kind of person who gets bothered by stuff like that and I absolutely HATE confrontation. But this was just ridiculous. After 30 mins of this nonsense I leaned down to the girl sitting right in front of me and asked her nicely if she could please keep it down. 

She didn’t look at me and just said “whatever.” I waited about 10 more mins and tried again. She turned around with the most annoyed look on her face and said “the fuck do you want?”  

I told her in a very calm nice voice that it wasn’t nice to speak loudly and ruin the experience for everyone around her. She stared at me and as she turned back around she called me a racist white bitch. 

At this point I know reasoning with her isn’t going to work and I’m not going to have my evening that I paid for ruined by bunch of rude ass teenagers. I went to one of the theater employees and explained that there was a group of kids being loud and obnoxious. 

The guy went up to them and asked to see their tickets and they all looked panicked and got up to follow him immediately. 

As we were leaving we saw the whole group of kids sitting outside. There was a security guard standing there talking to what I assume was either one of the kids mom.

The girl I had talked to saw me and pointed me out to her mom. This woman came stomping over to me and started yelling at me saying I complained about her kids because they were black and I was uncomfortable with having black kids sitting near me.

138,AmItheAsshole,"So when my wife and I first moved in together, 8 years ago, we rescued a dog, Xena, originally Cicillia but we called her Xena at the center and she was all over us so we figured we found her true name.  

She was 4 years old at the time, but died a few months back at the ripe ol' age of 12.  She was bound to our son since my wife started showing, always stuck by her belly and never left his cradle/bedside for nearly all of the 7 years they had together, they were best pals and he misses her like crazy. 

We had her cremated and buried in a small plot near our shed where my son would put flowers nearby everyweek and made a homemade sign for her.  However, it would get knocked around by weather or something and he'd get upset when someone walked too close to where we buried her, so he kept remaking it, and I thought he'd like something more permanent.

The wife thought it was a bit much, but said if I make it myself or got one for cheap she'd consider it.  Don't get me wrong, she loved Xena, she just didn't want some big ass marker in the ground showing off where dead dog ashes were buried. 

So I know a guy who knows a guy, and he let's me use his shop to make a headstone for Xena.  So we plant a tree sapling, a small blueberry bush(her favorite) actually, over where we put her ashes, and then put the headstone a bit in front of it.  Deep enough so it can't be knocked around, but still high enough to dig up and move if the bush doesn't want to grow around. 

The headstone isnt small, but isn't large, it's the perfect size for an adult sized blueberry bush, but until that grows, it's a bit prominent.

The problem is everytime someone is over and we show them around, our son will want to take them outside and show them where Xena is and will grow into.  We think it's a bit funny and cute, but some friends and neighbors have told us it's morbid what we did, and our son is sick for wanting to show it off.

I recently got out of a relationship and have been dating around for the last couple of months. Recently, I hung out with a guy named Adam (not real name) 3 times. I wouldn’t really call them dates, but I enjoyed my time with him. The last time we hung out, we ended up hooking up (with protection). Before doing so, we had a brief conversation about sexual history. I told him that the last time I was tested was in January of 2019 along with my ex boyfriend and that our results both came back negative. I also mentioned that Adam would be the first person I’ve slept with since the breakup. Additionally, Adam tells me that he was tested in the last few weeks and hasn’t been with anyone else since. 

Fast forward to about a week after the hookup, Adam texts me that he woke up with some strange symptoms consistent with STIs like pain with urination and a strange discharge, and said that he was headed to urgent care to get tested again. I told him to keep me updated and that I was sorry that he was having those symptoms. However, in my head I started to completely freak out. If I was the only person that Adam had slept with since his last results, it would obviously mean that I passed something along to him if he were to test positive for an STI. Knowing that my ex and I both tested negative, I started to wonder if my ex cheated on me and unknowingly passed along an STI. I quickly called my ex, who I had a pretty hard breakup with and explained what was going on. When my mind started to go down that extremely negative path, I told Adam that I’d like to know his results, but that I’d be taking some space to process my own emotions. 

About a week passes and Adam texts me that his results came back negative. I told him that was awesome and left the conversation at that. A couple of days later, I ask him if things are okay between us and he responded with a lengthy message. In summary, the message said:
- He was upset that I only cared about the results of his tests and not his health.
- He was upset that I asked for space because it left him dealing with things on his own.
- The whole situation left a bad taste in his month and he’s now taking a break from dating.
- That he didn’t know how to feel about me anymore.
- Now that he knows it’s not an STI, he has to figure out what’s wrong with him and it upsets him that I didn’t care to ask how he was handling that. 


When I received that message, I was extremely shocked. I felt bad that he felt alone in the situation, but I didn’t really feel like it was my responsibility to ask about his medical issues. I’ve only seen this guy 3 times and I couldn’t even tell you his last name, so I definitely did not think that it was appropriate for me to care about his health.

Over the last six months we've fell on especially hard times with me getting hospitalized and subsequently losing my job (boss was a nut job that wanted me to come in immediately after being released so I quit). Unrelated, my father made a habit about a year ago of sending me money almost weekly. It was not asked for; he is doing it out of the kindness of his heart and it is always appreciated. He sends it through Facebook pay and as I don't have my own active bank account, I linked it to my boyfriend's bank, always considering our money to be just that--ours.

The total averages about $30 weekly.

Now that I've lost my job, I've been more than happy to just let him have it to cover any and all expenses as he may see fit. Today, my dad sent me $60 out of nowhere. Also today, I landed a decent paying job that I'll begin orientation for on Monday. To celebrate, I thought I would buy myself a couple beers. When I told my boyfriend my intention he had a fit saying we needed to make sure the bills were paid first (they are) and that we don't need to waste the money. Says the guy who buys new video games weekly; and that's fine. It's his money. He's been paying the bills by himself for two months. But at what point do I have a say over $10-15 that was meant as a gift directly to me? It's on his card and in his bank account, and it feels really shitty to just take it and use it, but when my dad began sending it he made it clear to me that it was only supposed to be for me so that I could have a little extra money of my own.

It’s something she’s talked about doing for a while, but she didn't make the jump until recently. I told her I’d make sure there was food for her.

One of my best friends got me a nice set of ramekins as a Christmas gift, and I decided to test them out by making some smoked salmon souffles for dinner.

It was really tasty, and I thought it would be a good idea to make enough so that everyone could have it as a side and my cousin could have a large portion for her meal. I also made sure to keep the dressing separate from the salad because I knew it had honey in it. 

My cousin said she appreciated that I kept her in mind but that it seemed like her dinner was an “afterthought” and that salad wasn’t a meal on its own. She said if I had told her I was only making her a salad she would have brought a dish of her own to share.

Someone brought us a pizza, and one of my friends (really just an acquaintance) ate a piece until he got to the crust, and proceeded to put his crust back in the pizza box and close the lid. 

This irked me, not because he didn’t finish his pizza but... there was still more pizza left in the box. Why would you put your crust that you’ve eaten off of back in with the rest?? It is not a trash can why would you do that. I asked him why he did what he did and he just said “I can’t eat the crust.” I insisted that he throw it in a trash can instead of in the pizza box and he begrudgingly got up and said in a passive aggressive tone, “just for you!” Reddit, AITA?

143,AmItheAsshole,"Long story short, my current college roomate broke an appliance of mine that cost about $200. She has fully admitted to breaking it about a month ago and I haven't seen any payment yet. Her excuse is that she doesn't have enough money yet. 

I just overheard her on the phone, and she is about to book a ticket (that costs about $250) to visit her long distance on-off boyfriend next month.

144,AmItheAsshole,"I (27f) take the bus to work every day wearing a backpack. My line is often packed and since my friend got robbed of her wallet on public transport, I've had this habit of occasionally reaching back to check if my backpack's been opened or tampered with. Especially when I'm standing instead of sitting and there's a lot of people behind me.

So this morning my bus was pretty jammed, though not at its worst. I still reached back on instinct to touch my backpack couple of times when people gathered behind me. Then a group of Romanis (possibly a family, there were two adult women and two kids) got onto the bus to beg for change. This is common where we live and when they're done, they usually descend at the next station to do the same on another line.

However this group stayed on the bus even after begging. The two boys separated from the women - who stayed at the end of the bus - and randomly decided to stop exactly behind me, conversing about something in their language and laughing. After one of them bumped into me, I decided to take off my backpack and wear it on my chest instead.

The boys ran back to the women afterwards and I didn't think much of it until they approached me with an angry look. The women started yelling and swearing about me protecting the backpack like the boys are thieves. I told them I always look after my backpack when there's people behind me, pointing out the warning signs on the bus about keeping your possessions safe from pickpocketers. And tbh I don't trust beggars, so better be safe than sorry, however I didn't say that out loud.

They continued swearing at me, calling me hateful to Romanis, but I put in earbuds and ignored them until I could get off.

When I told the story to a co-worker over morning coffee, she told me I was definitely in the wrong if I only wear my backpack on the front with Romani people behind me. This had nothing to do with their ethnicity though, but the fact that they were beggars and acted suspiciously?

So, this happened about a week ago. 

Me and 3 friends, (3 girls I am a guy) were playing truth or dare, when my turn came up, I picked dare, and my dare was to choose any girl I wanted and grab her butt, so I chose the one I had a crush on the most, and snuck up behind her and grabbed her butt.

There is this one Woman that is approximately 3 years older than me and she is kinda difficult. 
We have been employed for the same time. 

She gets overwhelmed very very fast. One example was 2 months ago, we had to prepare a presentation with our results for the past quarter. We were on track and suddenly she begins to cry because she is scared we weren't going to finish in time. Another example was our boss comming in and asking us to change some things from the report. The sections that he wanted changed happened to be from her. She again began sobbing and our boss had to console her.

And it's always like that with her. And I am so fucking done. I am so annoyed. The slightest bit of stress arises and she cries. We have to stop till she stops and the resume again. It steals more time. 

So yesterday I asked our boss if I could change position as one of the guys  in the other group had graduated and was moving on. My boss told me that if I didn't have a reason that he'd rather keep me in my group.... So I told him that our working atmosphere was not the best.

My husband and I have been married for 4 years now, so this is an old situation but I still wonder if I was in the wrong.

When my husband and I got engaged my sister knew I wanted a September wedding. When we toured my dream venue the September for that year was booked so we planned our wedding for over two years out. The first weekend in September that year was Labor Day which I have always been told is a dick weekend to have your wedding so we planned it for the following weekend which ended up being the day after my sister's birthday. When I told her about the date I think I said something along the lines of ""we will have to celebrate you bday the next weekend that year."" I did not ask for permission.

One thing to note: my sister got married the same week that I graduated high school without consideration, so she set a precedent of not asking for permission beforehand.  

I really did not think much of it. It was her 33rd bday, so not a milestone one. Every year we go to the same bar to celebrate and I planned my honeymoon so that I would be back the following weekend so that we could go out. During the wedding planning time she never complained to me about the date. We ended up having a rehearsal dinner on her bday (the night before my wedding) and my mom gave her a happy bday speech. I paid for her and her husband to have a room at the hotel all weekend so that she didn't have to stress about driving. All was fine, I thought.

I found out after the fact that she complained to everyone about the date and thought I was trying to ""one up"" her wedding. I don't even know what to say to that. My wedding wasn't some peacock color themed extravaganza. And she never spoke to me about this. Looking back I think she used the date as a way to be mad at me and justify ruining some of the planned things. No one close to me said anything about it beforehand, not like I would have changed the date but I at least could have told her that I didn't do it as some slight to her.  She ended up pulling some bullshit the night of her bday/day before my wedding and got too drunk and made a mess of things.  I tried to just move on but I was so mad I confronted her and asked for an apology, which she never gave.  We tried to move on but then other bullshit happened (she cheated on her husband for the 90th time with my husbands best friend) and now we don't really talk.

After our sober brunch, she and I visited this cool bar/restaurant that she had wanted to show me. We sat at the bar. We chatted with the bartender a bit. My friend commented that she liked her pizza sweater, we talked about how the cool the bar was and the like for a couple of minutes. It seemed like she liked us. When she asked for our order, my friend ordered a beer. Then I ordered a vodka soda. I asked if it would be possible to make it a double.

She replied to me that they “\*technically\* we can’t make double drinks”. I was a little unsure why she said “technically”. I asked her, somewhat jokingly.. expecting to get rejected… if it would be possible to order a shot of a vodka AND a vodka soda with a little less mixer. (It was clear I was ordering this way to avoid it from technically being a double… but I could pour the shot into the mixed drink to make one). I’ve had bartenders tell me to order essentially the same from them when I would try to order a double from them at a major sporting arena.

After my question, she does not respond, but instead turns around and gets our order. She fulfills my request, but she’s pretty \*ice cold\* from that point forward. She doesn’t speak to us anymore and appears to avoid us.

Eventually, like 10 minutes later, my friend notices that the other bartender was working the last time my friend was there around 9 months ago.. and it was his first day bartending that day.

It seems like he appreciated the conversation as he told us it was really slow in there and that they were really bored. Ironically, the drink I order from him seemed… really stiff.

I used to live in a pretty big house divided in several ""apartments"". It's not a building, just a big house, built and owned by my family. Only 2 out of approximately 6 apartments are beings used. I used to live in one of those apartments with my parents and siblings (older sister, younger brother).

In the apartment next to ours live my grandmother, uncle, aunt and their 3 children. My siblings and I were really close to our cousins and we literally helped raise them. I was their babysitter whenever they needed one and I spent hours with them daily - playing, studying, feeding them... 

Anyway, my siblings and I were raised to always take care of our toys and we really did when we were younger. When we got older we took those toys and put them away, nicely wrapped, in the attic. We gave some of the toys to our cousins but we kept some to give to our future children - we had some really high quality toys in there that we got as a gift from the company our dad used to work for. There were also a lot of clothes there from when we were babies or just really small.

My cousins were horrible to their toys. Breaking them, drawing on them, kicking and throwing them around. Not a single toy survived longer than a few days with them. 

One day, I went to see my cousins and I saw a few of my toys from the attic on the floor. I was confused. I asked my youngest cousin (cause she's the only girl out of 3 of them and the toys were really girly) where she got those toys and she said my aunt let her take it from the attic. I talked to her a bit about how it's not nice to take other people's things without asking (she knew it was mine) and she understood. I didn't take it or told her to give it back. I just wanted her to understand that it's bad to take other people's stuff without asking. My aunt heard our talk and got pissed. She aggressively took the toy from my cousin's hand, gave it to me and said ""There you go, take it!"" and told my cousin ""Look at what your cousin did! She's really selfish, it's not nice to be selfish.""

My cousin got sad and I gave her the toy back and told her I want her to have it and I told my aunt that that wasn't the point - the point was she can't take stuff without asking and that it was her (my aunt's) fault cause she's a bad example.
I couldn't belive a 5 year old can understand simple manners better than a 30-something year old woman..

I get it, he’s very passionate about it and wanted his friends to be “morally correct” as well and I don’t blame him. I had explained my reasons for not wanting to go vegetarian and I could tell he didn’t think they were good enough reasons but I didn’t think any of it. It was my own choice anyway and I feel it would be a wrong reason to change my diet if it was only to please my friend and not because it was rooted in some personal morality or ideals. 

We had decided we just shouldn’t talk about the subject anymore, because we would always get into arguments about it. Not about wether or not he should be vegetarian, of course, I supported him and admired him for being so passionate about a cause that does more good than harm anyway. And that worked for a while. 

Until he learned that I was working towards becoming a veterinarian doctor. He started tweeting things on his “private account” that was obviously about me. I told him I didn’t want to read it because it upset me to the core so I had unfollowed that account, and then he started doing it on his “public account” as to make sure I saw it. It would be comments like “I’d never trust a vet who is also a meat eater” and other things along those lines. When I brought it up to him he told me it was because he cared about me too much and that it was a coping mechanism to “like me less” and because he didn’t want his friends to do things that worsened the current environmental issues and also hurting animals. 

I said some things I regret now in that conversation. We were talking about how I did everything I could to help the environmental situation the ways I could, like not driving cars, etc. Which I guess he took very personal as well, as he loves driving his car. We both came with some pretty awful comments until he said something personal about my private life that made me snap and just end the friendship right there, which hurt his feelings A LOT as I know he did actually care a lot about me and our friendship.

We have known that we have wanted to get engaged for a long time. My partner bought the ring over a year before the proposal happened, we have a young kid together and are sure we want to be together forever. Last summer my partner's brother proposed to his girlfriend so we decided to wait longer to give them some time to enjoy their moment. My partner eventually proposed this past Christmas and I couldn't have been happier. 

However, then when we announced to the family that we were now engaged my partners brother didn't offer up a congratulations, strange but we would see him later so we didn't pay too much attention to it at first. Then when we were announcing it to the extended family while they were over for the holiday the brother and his fiance left the room and wouldn't look at us at all. The whole day then I felt it would not have been appreciated if I brought it up again. 

It took a week then for my partners mother to congratulate us because she didn't want to upset them, trying to keep the peace. They have made it clear that they are not happy that we got engaged so soon after them and for stealing their spotlight. This attitude has continued and it has really put a damper on what should have been one of the best times in my life.

I have now decided to reply in kind and not talk to them either. Which could be making the situation worse but I really feel unwanted within that family now and like I'm the bad guy just for getting engaged. 

Am I the asshole for not talking to them because they are angry we have gotten engaged too soon after them?","AITA for getting engaged ""too soon""?"

165,AmItheAsshole,"Hello, this is my first time posting anything in Reddit, but I just need to know if I'm an asshole or not. There is alot to unpack here and this is a throwaway account. I hope my family doesn't use Reddit....

For Background: I have 3 older sisters, and 1 younger sister,E (F25). When I was young and naive, my parents taught me about how being gay was bad. Unbeknownst to me, was that one of my oldest sisters,B (F29), turned out gay, and it was a hell storm in my family when I was younger. I didn't know but was later told by my other sister, A (F30). I use to be homophobic but because of this and some friends, I finally mended my ways and became more accepting. I regret ever saying the things I did, and continue to try and be more open minded. And guess what? Now I'm gay!

So my family moved on from that, and now I'm 26 and found the love of my life. I've been very worried about coming out to my family about my SO (F27). First off, my dad is still homophobic, and my mom is thankful that 1 of her daughter is just gay (oh mom~). 

I pursed my relationship in secret with alot of close calls, but it worked until my younger sister managed to get into my laptop, read my Facebook messages, and found out I was in a relationship. My heart BROKE, and I was devastated that my privacy was invaded. For context: I didn't tell my family where I was, so she went through my messages to find out. (Well guys, now I have a tracking device LMFAO.)

It's been down hill since. My younger sister is hanging it over my head, telling me to tell Mom cause it's considered lying. That now she has to carry this over HER head cause I'm living a lie. It looks like she told my older sisters and her boyfriend too, cause her boyfriend keeps making comments about how he's surrounded by gay people (when me and my gay aunt are around.) And my older sister, A , (F30) just sat me down right nowto tell me that I need to calm down in going over to see my SO so much (they live a hour and 30 away from me and I see them once every weekend. Or 3 times a week if I sleep over). That I need to tell Mom about this cause I'm living this lie. That its unfair to my parents too since they've allowed me and my SO to sleep over at each other's places cause they think we're friends. While my sister's boyfriend has a curfew.

The only thing is that I already feel like my mom knows that me and SO are dating? Only cause the walls are thin and my younger sister has YELLED at me how I'm living a lie and how I pretty much dont care about this family(??). I'm still unsure about this tbh. 

But Reddit, I'm asking, AITA for not telling my parents that I'm(F26) gay and dating my ""friend""(F27). 

Side note: I still live with my parents and sisters. I'm going to move out in a couple of months with SO once I get my Masters Degree. SO and I have been together for 2 years.

Basically, the cafe I work at has (clearly marked) handicap tables that are designed to have wider sides, be slightly lower to the ground, and have some pull-out trays so that people who are in a wheelchair can have an easier time. We have several of these tables in the cafe, as well some high-top tables, cushion seats, stools, and regular tables. 

One of our regulars, lets call her Amy, has a favorite table to sit at. She's an older woman with a walker/cane, and likes to sit at a specific handicap tables because of how close it is to the hand-off plane and trash can. However, she came in one morning to find a college student sitting there.

 From the time I clocked in, the student had been sitting there (about 2+ hours at this time). This was also back in December, so I figured she must be studying for finals. She had her coat, backpack, books, binder, notes, laptop, etc etc all scattered throughout the table. She was well set-up and situated. Amy walked over and demanded that she move from her seat, since this was a handicap table and that she had a walker. The student refused, claiming that the walker did not prevent her from sitting at one of the other tables which were available. No other handicap tables were available, but there were cushion seats and a regular table available (regular being normal height, normal width, and no additional trays). 

Upset, Amy marched over to me and demanded that I remove the student from that table. I explained that I couldn't do that because it is against store policy to ask someone to leave who is not causing a threat or disturbance. Amy then claimed it was discriminatory, since she was legally handicapped (had a parking tag) and that was marked a handicapped table. I told her that it was meant for wheelchairs to be able to comfortably roll up, since other tables aren't wide enough/are too tall. I offered to bring her food and drinks out to her at one of the regular tables, and said I could drag an additional stool over to that table if it helped at all.

She refused my offer, tried to get another coworker to move the student (who deferred her back to me, the supervisor on duty). Amy left in a huff, claiming that she would never return to ""such a disrespectful establishment"". 

So, AITA for refusing to move the student?",AITA for refusing to move someone so a handicapped woman can sit at a handicapped table?
168,AmItheAsshole,"First time posting so I apologize for anything I may have done wrong. 

I (23F) have a BIL (40M) I never want to be around again because my family found out a while ago that he’s been cheating on my sister (40F) their whole marriage. They’ve been married over 10 years, turns out he’s a sex addict and was sleeping with other people since they were dating. The signs were always there but everybody ignored them (he admitted to cheating on his ex-wife early on in the relationship, a few women directly contacted my sister to tell her about the affairs over the years, the obgyn told my sister she contracted hpv...WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT, they now have a 7yo). I’ve been told he hooked up with coworkers and prostitutes, without condoms. This was all shocking to us to say the least. 

We all found out the fall before last when another woman contacted my sister and when my sister confronted her husband about it and he finally broke down and admitted to it. I’ve always thought something was off with him, because when I was younger I caught him creepily staring at me during family functions, to the point it made me uncomfortable. But I never knew it was this bad. 

After a few months the rest of the family forgave and forgot, but I still despise him and am still just uncomfortable at the thought of being around him. I feel like he got away with murder because my family was so quick to forget about it and pretend like nothing happened, welcoming him back with open arms. During the height of the drama they even blamed my sister for not being a good wife and satisfying him. My family is older and “traditional”,  the men come first and women are servants, that’s their mentality. So it’s not surprising they blamed my sister. 

My sister and her husband are still together and want to continue with the marriage, going to therapy and all that. 

I’ve managed to skip the holidays with them by going to my boyfriends family, solely because I want to avoid the BIL. My family lives in the same city so I see them throughout the year, my sister less so, but it’s not like I never see them. My mom wants me to get over it and start going to family functions again but I’ve refused to because I’m uncomfortable being around him and hate how the family handled it.

169,AmItheAsshole,"Okay so, a little backstory I'm the only girl in a friend group that I play games with online (we know each other irl) and for years one of them has constantly called me thinks like stupid and annoying, and motivated the others to follow along.

So this friend, recently started answering every message I send with something that starts a huge argument because he thinks I'm annoying. Usually his main point is like ""you're annoying and not funny and I don't like you,"" and I admit to being not funny and sometimes annoying but he tries to get me to leave the group chat we have then. 
And occasionally some of my other friends join in and agree, (most haven't) and he always claims he's speaking for everyone saying none of them like me, which I've said I'd leave the group chat if they though I was so annoying.

At one point, I left for a week and when I joined back he said sorry and I thought it'd be fine. But apparently, contrary to what he's said to others, when he appologises every thing in the past is forgotten. So when I sent a message that had ""attitude"" he got all mad about it and went back to his old self.

So, AITA for not leaving the group chat when ""everyone"" wants me gone because I'm annoying, stupid, and unfunny? Are my friends the assholes for not stepping up and helping me out?

EDIT: a lot of people have been asking why I haven't left, so I decided it would be best to copy and paste my answer here
Mainly because the memories, I've been part of this friend group since middle school. Also because I'm afraid I won't find another group of people that I can play video games with from my school, as there aren't many and im not the best at making friends.

170,AmItheAsshole,"My wife has a birthday coming up in the beginning of February. Back in October, we both put in to take the week off to take a family road trip someplace warmer (we live in the Midwest). About a month ago, my 10yr old daughter brought us the her choir schedule for 2020 and we saw she had two performances the week of our trip. We figured she would miss the performances, but over the past couple of weeks, my daughter has voiced that she really wanted to perform. My wife said that was fine and she could push our vacation out to President's day weekend so the kids miss less time from school. We still did not have a destination set in stone but Florida was looking to be a possibility. Around this time, I FaceTimed with my parents and grandma who live in Texas. They were at the hospital as my grandma had recently fallen and was about to go in for surgery. It was kind of hard on her as she is bipolar, and is dealing with early stages of dementia so she didn't completely understand everything that was going on. It was hard seeing her like that and I broke down crying once I got off the call. My wife felt bad and said we can take our family trip to Texas to see my parents and grandma since we've never been down to visit them, and it's warmer than where we live. My parents and I don't have the best relationship, so I said that would be nice so long as we didn't spend more than a couple of days visiting them. We also discussed going to other cities as well in Texas to do sightseeing with our kids along with maybe hitting up a beach. We started researching and looking at places to go, but today my wife let me know she's not looking forward to the trip. I knew she wasn't looking forward to seeing my parents as she gets along with them less than I do. I asked her if it was just because of my parents, and she said because from the start the vacation was supposed to be for her birthday but now it's a trip to go see my family. She then said, to not be surprised if she acted like a bitch her whole birthday weekend and during our vacation. To put in perspective, she's a ""when momma's not happy, ain't nobody happy"" kind of person. As we haven't finalized anything, I told her we could change plans, but she said no it would be stupid to change again.

So I get it. She felt bad for my situation with my family and tried to come up with a way to fix it and make me feel better. I feel bad that she doesn't get what she had initially envisioned for her birthday, but also feel like she offered it up so she could guilt trip me later.

171,AmItheAsshole,"

My high school graduation was last year and I didn’t let my dad come. Our relationship has never been the best. Mostly because he has anger issues. He gets angry very easily and has bursts of anger and sometimes throws objects occasionally.

The day of graduation, I was quite emotional because 2 years ago, I was getting bullied. It was affecting every aspect of my life which resulted in severe depression and anxiety. One of the main reasons why I can’t bring myself to forgive my dad is because when I needed him the most, I felt like he stabbed me in the back. My mom wanted to go speak to my school with him because her english isn’t the best whereas my dad is fluent. That morning he threw one of his angry fits. He said that this was stupid and that he doesn’t want to go. He then proceeded to say that it was ALL my fault and I was to blame for ME getting bullied. He went on a tirade of horrible things. I’ve tried to hard to forgive and forget but I really can’t. I didn’t fight back, I just stood there and took his verbal abuse. 

Fast forward to graduation day where I was pretty emotional because I couldn’t have imagined that day would come and I was proud that I worked through my anxiety and depression. I invited my aunts and uncles, my grandparents, and my immediate family. That morning he was on another one of his temper tantrums. He was yelling that he had to come and see my extended family and that it was annoying and uncomfortable. He then proceeded to say more things that was insulting to my mom. I sort of lost it and yelled back at him. I told him he can have fun at home because I didn’t want him there anyways. I could tell he was slightly hurt but he retaliated by saying more mean things. He said good, he didn’t want to come anyways and that I needed to shut up and apologize for being so rude. So i ripped up his invitation and ticket he needed for the ceremony. My mom was stunned and my grandma was so upset. She begged me to forgive him and that a father needs to be there. I refused and stood my ground. I looked so puffy and red from crying and my mood was killed. I felt like he ruined a special day for me.

He didn’t come to the graduation but for the family dinner afterwards, I let him come because I felt bad NOT for him but for my grandmother who was crying because she was so upset. 

Now I moved out in November to a different country because honestly I cannot live with him. He makes me so upset and every time he yells my anxiety spikes and its not good for me mentally. I was at dinner and my uncle jokingly tells my dad that he's an ass for not coming because he doesn’t know what really happened. My uncle said that as a father its his duty to come and be there for his first daughter. My dad looked uncomfortable and laughed awkwardly. In the car home, my mom says that I was too stubborn and I should’ve just forgiven my dad and let him come. Now I'm thinking maybe I was too harsh?",AITA?

172,AmItheAsshole,"EDIT: My apologies. When I lost the plot at lunch and mentioned the ""admin"" , I was referring to the admin/Deans of the department he was trying to hire me into. NOT the university admin (him).  In the full two days prior to the gin-apocalypse, when I was still gently and politely deflecting the dry-humping- the one thing I kept referring to was the departments lack of diversity, the lack of admin/Dean experience (both deans came to that uni as freshman and never left (literally), the 3-year hiring cycles, &amp; the lack of any seasoned faculty (hence the daycare shot). All of which are a huge red flags in academia. I believe the reason he was so insistent is he thought I could solve all those systemic issues and the reason he focused solely on what he perceived I could do FOR them, and no mention of what this meant for my career.

Also, WEDDING. Not a hostage situation masquerading as a job interview.

Backstory: I work in higher education and have been living/working overseas for over 14 years. My best friends live in an area of the US that I used to live and would love to return to, but the area has become stupidly expensive in the past few years. I do keep an eye on job postings in the neighboring state, because it is within a few hours of my friends and way more affordable.

Last Fall, I was asked to officiate a friend’s wedding. The service was fun and low-key followed by a full-on 3-day party, replete with all kinds of shenanigans. Which meant we spent a lot of time with the wedding party and guests.

At the wedding, I was introduced to a man whois the President of a small university in the neighboring state. I was informed of his institution, because I had previously considered a position and had deep dived their entire website. I promptly realized it was a bad fit, for reasons to follow. He was exceedingly informed of me via my friends and LinkedIn.

Cue the University President full-court-pressing me to come work at his university.

He never mentioned what the university could do for my career, he concentrated on all the ways my experience would be useful to their strategic plan and mission. It was super flattering, until it just felt desperate and weird.

Side-note: I am not that attractive of an academic hire. I am not robustly published. My skillset is as a practitioner and teacher-trainer. All of his perceptions were based exclusively on the fact I have worked out of the country.

At lunch the second day, he was insistent to the point of being antagonistic. I thanked him profusely for his interest and ended it with (paraphrased, as there was gin involved),

“The department you think I will transform is dead in the water. The department admin came to the university as freshman and now, 18-years later are now in management, with no other experience. The department research is archaic and not aligned with current norms. The faculty rank turn-over is on a 3-year cycle, which tells me you hire new graduates, who gather 3 to 4 years of resume fodder and then are off like a robber’s dog. There is no consistency and no experience in the ranks, which is exactly how a weak department administration would prefer it. Anyone you hire will be demoralized or collapse to the level of the current department admin, as this kind of entrenchment is impossible to crack. You basically have an academic daycare and I am not remotely interested. Who wants fried pickles?”

Several of my friends are aghast. They think I was rude to say this in front of people, dismissing the fact that he spent 2 days dry-humping me in front of everyone.

173,AmItheAsshole,"About a year ago she was homeless and my dad wasn’t treating her right so I took her in. We made ground rules as we knew she was an addict (she of course denied it), which included not going out at weird hours/with weird people, and starting to budget and figure out what she’s going to do to live on her own. She gets a disability check of $1300 a month. Average rent for a studio here is $450-$550 so it’s doable. She would sneak out at night a lot and one night disappeared into the darkness after stealing our scooter. A few months later we sold the Xbox she left at our home bc we figured we would never see her again and she’d either be dead or in jail. Fast forward to yesterday. She calls me in hysterics, still needs a place to stay this time she will change. I have no real idea what she’s done with her money. She said “ohhh I rented a truck for a week which was $1500,” “oh I have to rent a storage unit to live in which was $300 a month.” How the hell... I looked up the storage units she was talking about and they’re $63 a month. Anyways, after I call her back to say yes she sounds perfectly normally and fine. Once we get home she starts asking to have a phone blah blah blah. Gave her our back up phone, she confronts about the Xbox I told her I was sorry and would replace it tomorrow. We went to bed shortly after. I have cameras in my house now, so I saw that throughout the night she went outside a few times for up to 1.5 hours at a time. It seemed as though she was talking to somebody through our door at one point. We also caught her on camera stealing items from us, weirder less important items including the batteries in our remote and paper towels (wtf???? Lmao). So I wake up and start getting ready for work, which was before I watched the cameras and didn’t know about her nightly charades. She then started interrogating me about the Xbox! Like that should be her priority in the first place however on another hand I feel extremely guilty I sold it as it was her only and prized possession. It ended up with my screaming at her about how I’ve had to fend for myself my whole life with no guidance, I’ve never had parents, yet I let her stay in my HOUSE and feed HER, all that stuff. She continues about the Xbox, totally disregarding my break down about how I’ve never had parents. My girlfriend gets pissed and kicked her out. It’s snowing here and I feel really guilty. On the spare phone we gave her we left the “find my friends” app activated. She’s currently at her climate controlled storage unit. 

TLDR; my mom is a homeless addict who has never been there for me, and has stolen from me multiple times. I sold an Xbox she left at my house a year ago, and kicked her out bc she wouldn’t let it go (I was going to replace for her tomorrow). I feel guilty I sold it and for kicking her out. I mean, it was her only possession so of course she would be upset about it.

174,AmItheAsshole,"Genuinely curious... A tad long, so please bear with me. 

I live in an apartment, a decent one in a nice neighborhood. Been living here with my family for 4 years now. A couple of months ago, new neighbors moved into the third floor of the building (I live in the 2nd floor), directly above us. 

First few months went by without too much of a hitch then days suddenly progressed into loud music, kids running around, thumping, talking loudly on the patio at 2 a.m. in the morning etc., They weren't the best neighbors at this point, but everything was tolerable, civil, to a degree. 

Then yesterday I come home and glimpse out into the porch where my mother has several plants (awesome ones she's cared for over 10+ years) hanging over the metal fence. 

Something was glistening. Odd. It hadn't rained recently so we both went outside and was absolutely MORTIFIED to find a pile of VOMIT just pooled on our plants and patio. Along with several pieces of random trash. The smell... was utterly unbearable. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

We tried to be understanding, maybe something happened, yadda yadda. But the more and more we thought about it and as we cleaned the nasty stuff (took over 2 hours), I became livid at how incredibly rude and gross it was. God forbid anyone was seriously ill and was passing that along. And who the hell throws up over the patio from the top floor? If our plants hadn't ""caught"" the vomit, it would have gone straight down to our 1st floor neighbors. 

So que my ass along with my sister going upstairs. Knocked on the door for 5-10 straight minutes. Finally one of the residents come out, immediately says, ""no english"". 

Huh?????

We whipped out our Google translator and basically informed her of the vomit and trash on our porch in desperate hopes that hey, maybe PLEASE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS DISGUSTING AND RUDE?! 

Her response (from what we could gather from the translator)? ""I wasn't here so it wasn't me. But I'll find out who it was.."" and she shuts the door. 

We were floored. 

I've lived in apartments for over a decade, different cities, complexes, neighborhoods and never had experienced this. 

I emailed the front office and asked them for advice on how to handle this situation if by golly, it HAPPENS AGAIN and have a Spanish speaking associate have a chat with them IN CASE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND OUR REQUEST. I honestly don't know if they realize what they did was.... NOT OK??

180,AmItheAsshole,"I work in car sales at a large dealership in a big city. Today I showed up early to help some clients that I made appointments with. The foot traffic was starting to pick up and I was nearly finished making my call outs I had planned so I decided to walk the lot. As I get outside a guy in his mid to late forties pulls up in an old beat up two door truck. We start shooting the shit for a few minutes about what brought him out and decide to have a look at a new car.  

We walk inside and I show him around a vehicle he’s interested in. After showing him it I ask him to hop in to show him some features. 

This is where it gets weird... the guy’s eyes go wide in a look of shock and panick...
He says “ oh uh... no... thanks”

I’ll a little confused... but then the smell hits me. This potent smell of the nastiest fart Ive ever tasted. 
I look at him visibly confused because he’s acting super weird for a fart, all be it the monster it was.

He says... “Ok then I’m going to go.”

Instinctively I say “sorry sir did I do something to offend you? Or were you wanting to look at something else?”

I look down at his pant leg and see a wet brownie forming next to his shoe. Chocolate protein powder just pooling up and I start to put shit together...

He knows.
I know.
He knows I know.

He says “no no uh no I gotta, I gotta go.”

I say “uh... have a.... good day” but I know full well it’s gone to shit. The worst part is I can still hear the sound of his soppy socks creating suction in his shoes.

I stood there bewildered...

my manager comes over to ask me what happened. 

I tell him “he threw up the dueces and left.”

My manager: “what do you mean?”
 he steps around the car and sees our floor fertilized and then a trail of ‘who dun it’ slopping to the guys truck and he quickly backs away. 

Queue the argument. 

My manager looks at me and says
“You need to get some paper towels or something and clean this shit up.”

I  am shocked. I’m thinking No. Absolutely not.
Me: “There is no amount of paper between my fingers that would make me touch a turd. Look at it! It’s wet!”

Him:”I DONT CARE GET A FUCKING MOP AND CLEAN THIS UP” 

Me: “I can’t, no way I can deal with shit. I’m happy to sell cars, but there is no way I’m on poo patrol”

Him: “Then get the fuck out of here if you don’t want to do what I say. Don’t bother coming back tomorrow either”

Me: “like I said I’m happy to do the job that you hired me for but I cant bring myself to steep for another mans stool. No way. That’s not my job”

Him: “Get out then!”

I was dumbfounded. On one hand I was probably a bit to joking about the situation, but I’d never had a grown man gaze into my eyes as he shit himself. So I figured I’d try not to be to disgusted and just see the bright side of it instead of letting it flush away the rest of a good day. But was I really in the wrong for refusing to clean another mans shit? There is no fucking way I will clean any other grown mans poo.

182,AmItheAsshole,"     I'll give some context to the story. (these are all fake names for obvious reasons) The 2 friends involved are named Katy and Makena. My ex bfs name is Chad. 

  We all having 2nd period Pe together, which has never been an issue. 90% of the year has been pretty civil between me and Chad. But things took an unexpected turn when chad started tickling me. Around my stomach area. and it hurts a lot, too. today, I was hanging out with Kate and Makena during Pe. chad comes over and of course starts doing the tickling thing.

   I told him to stop. he goes away for 5 mins, comes back and does it again. at this point i was already frustrated so I told him to fuck off. He of course, doesnt care and once again starts tickling me. I push him away from me and I ask him why the fuck he cant keep his hands off of me. He then said, and I quote,"" I dont wanna stop, since I find it funny when you say no.""

   
   That's when I fucking broke. I told him to get his fucking shit together and to leave me alone. My friends, unfortunately said to the situation, that if I swore less and was nicer he would have stopped. they just said he was doing it because ""boys will be boys"" They keep on trying to argue the what he did was fine

183,AmItheAsshole,"Bit of background, me and 6 other friends all moved into a house for 2nd year university. As a group of 7, 6 of us were all really tight and effectively a ‘squad’ and there was one other member, Tony, who we were all good friends with but not as close. 

We had somewhat predetermined which rooms we wanted, but there was still room for debate. Due to various circumstances, people moved into the house at different times. 2 of the house members moved into the house and claimed the rooms they wanted. Tony then moved into the house after, and claimed a room that was up for debate between Tony and Aron. 

Eventually, me and Aron got to moving into the house. When we arrived, most of the rooms were locked and Aron as a joke decided to kick down one of housemates’ door (not Tony’s) for a laugh because he hadn’t seen any rooms before. We we were all friends, and we knew this wouldn’t be a big deal. After Aron kicked down a door, I thought this was really funny and joined in and kicked down another one of my housemates’ door. Aron then kicked down Tony’s door (knowing it was the room that he “had chosen”) and was upset to see that Tony had moved into “Aaron’s” room. 

Aron as a “tongue in cheek” joke moved all of Tony’s stuff out into another room. (Tony hadn’t moved into the room properly, but simply dumped his suitcases in the middle of the room). Aron then moved his own stuff into the room and took it as his own. 

Once Tony found out what had happened, he was upset and reported us to the landlord about what had happened. We later found out he had medical issues due to stress over the summer. We believe he wanted to move out of the house anyway and used this as a reason to leave the house. We were always good friends with Tony and never had any actual mal-intent, but Tony clearly took this the wrong way. 

Tony decided to leave the house because of this, resulting in an unfilled tenancy in the house for his room. We are yet to find a new tenant to live in the house and as a result are jointly-liable (due to the contract) as a house to the $8000 rent due.

This rent must be paid at the end of our contract (mid-July). The landlord is pressing charges against the entire house (except Tony) to cover the rent due. Tony has expressed the only reason he left the house is because of the actions of Aron. 

Aron has asked me to subside $1500 dollars of the payment, because I did kick down 1 door as well. However I did not kick down Tony’s door and essentially had nothing to do with it. 

AITA for refusing to subsidise Aron for $1500 because I had technically had nothing to do with Tony the kicking down of his door, even though  I  did kick down one of my housemates door in general (this house housemate didn’t care at all as we were good friends).

184,AmItheAsshole,"So me and one of my friends have recently fallen out because of something i did. I know I’m the asshole in that situation, so not even going to ask you guys.... But I’m worried about her for different reasons. 
She has suffered from anxiety, stress and depression for a while now and has had experiences that don’t help with the situation, we are both current, at university studying a masters. She lives with her twin sister, but her sister is not home much because she also graduated last year an is currently in a new relationship and trying to find work in a different city. My friend used to talk to her a lot about her issues and stress, but of course this isn’t possible just now. I know she misses her sister terribly, but she doesn’t want to get in the ah of her sisters new life and interfere with her moving on. 
I can’t talk to my friend just now because we are currently not speaking much. We used to hang out alll the time and I used to be her stress sounding board. But just now I can’t be, 
What I want to do is contact her sister without telling my friend, then tell her that my friend misses her and is stress and feeling anxious. I want to do it in a way so my friend doesn’t know I’m worried about her, a private message or something,

185,AmItheAsshole,"A few days ago my girlfriend posted about a politician that I know way too much about. And I mean his entire political history. She said she would have preferred him over another politician and by the time I saw the post someone had already mentioned how awful he was. But I liked their comment and wrote my own in a playful but dramatic way.

Somewhere along the lines of ""OMG HE IS THE DEVIL!!!"" Then, as per my usual fashion I was going to write another more poignant comment about how it's easy to fall for that point of view because of how he carries himself and if you know nothing about him. I was also going to cover this with my own political overview of his career.

She deleted it within 10 minutes of my first comment. When I presses send my other comment was gone. I was kind of disappointed because I thought she would like to debate this topic online since she had it on her page. Especially since she spends so much time debating people online who are racist, homophobic, ect...and we both like to talk politics and things like that already either online or over the phone.

I called her and asked why she deleted it and she basically told me it felt like no one supported her opinion. I told her that's because it was wrong and explained the mans political career to her because 1 I knew it and I was excited to share and 2 I thought it would put things in perspective to why others reacted that way. She said she understood why now and we went on with our conversation as normal. I asked her before we both hung up if I upset her or if she felt attacked by me or the other people still and she said no but she does this thing where she'll kind of lie about that until later when she just can't anymore. So, to better catch and self regulate myself I thought I'd ask the internet.

And I'm asking this because I know I can be in the wrong. Especially with people I love and trust and want to grow when I see something incorrect. I have definitely gone overboard in the past and regretted it later. So, I wouldn't be mad if anyone did call me the asshole and gave me some constructive criticism.

186,AmItheAsshole,"So, sister (26) recently got engaged. She and her fiancé had been pretty secretive about details but invited me (31) and our other sister (34) out for drinks and surprised us each with a box she made. We opened them up and inside were little Ireland trinkets. This was her way of telling us that surprise! We’re doing a destination wedding in Ireland..on Christmas Eve 2020. Couple important things to add at this point: We live in the US, other sister (34) just did a destination wedding in Mexico a few months ago which newly engaged sister complained a lot about (to me) due to the cost and inconvenience. Other sister and new husband also have plans to start trying for a baby next month, so she will very likely either be pregnant or have a fresh baby by the time the wedding rolls around. Newly engaged sister knows that my husband and I as well as our parents are struggling financially. I did my best to act as excited as possible about the wedding, thought I pulled it off. But she just sent me a shitty text about how it’s bullshit that I’m not acting more excited for her and being supportive. Truth be told, no one in our family is excited. This is going to be costly and it’s hijacking our entire Christmas. WIBTA if I flat out tell her this? I know she’s stressed and disappointed that people haven’t reacted with more excitement, so I don’t know if it’s best for me to leave it alone because maybe our family is being TA for not being more excited about her big day?

Edit: I really appreciate all the input, including the YTA and ESH verdicts as it gave me perspective into what she may be feeling. At the end of the day though most of the comments made me realize how absurd her expectations are. I did talk to her, took advice of several people here on how to do that, and she seems to be reconsidering. I also suggested she research more because the kind Irish people of Reddit had some good points about weather and availability for Christmas Eve. I think she is leaning towards ceremony here and honeymoon in Ireland.",WIBTA for telling my sister her destination wedding is inconsiderate?
187,AmItheAsshole,"So I’m 21 years old and I’ve had Type 1 Diabetes for 13 years now. My mother has always had a lot of anxiety over my disease, and throughout my childhood and teenage years she had various ways of handling it. When her and my father would get up and go to work at 8am, 14 year old me would have to wake up at the same time even if I had no where to be because she didn’t trust that I could survive the morning if I slept in (her fear is that my blood sugar will go low and I won’t wake up). My bedroom also essentially had a mandatory open-door policy and up until I was 17 she would come in at all hours of the night to perch herself on my bed and test my blood sugar. I’m also (still) obligated to text her all day while she’s at work so that she knows I’m okay throughout the day. There’s other examples of this sort of thing but I think you get the idea. 

Now I’m 21, and the one main rule that remains in place is that I have to wake up early (9am) and return her text messages while she’s at work to verify that I’m alive. I have to do this even if I have nothing going on that day and have the opportunity to sleep in. Most of the time I manage to wake up early and appease her, but sometimes I leave my phone on silent and I sleep in till 11:30am or so. This is exactly what happened this morning and I woke up to a full red alert. I had a dozen missed calls and a barrage of irate text messages, and my mother was just about to leave work to come home and wake me up. She also calls my dad at work and screams at him whenever this happens, and he is obligated to pester me as well or come home and check on me (even though he doesn’t agree with her behaviour at all).

My mother thinks I’m inconsiderate and that she’s not asking for much. I think that her irrationality has gone to the extreme and that as an adult it’s up to me how long I sleep in for.

190,AmItheAsshole,"I (M18) have a friend (M; M21) who I've met almost two years ago. When I met M., He was heavily addicted to cocaine, but I wasn't bothered about it. Over the years he tried to quit many many times and relapsed. I've always told him that if he wants to try to quit again I'll support him  100% and that I'm still glad to have him as a friend. Everytime he quit, his personality changed drastically. He went from fidgety, anxious and restless to very quiet, reserved and overall just depressed because of his withdrawal symptoms. 

Now a few months ago he stated that he would quit again after we lost a great friend of ours. The weird thing is that the personality changes didn't come with it. He's still very restless and fidgety, sometimes even aggressive. When I asked him about it, he said that because of his ADHD and autism he started to take on these quirks and now can't get rid of them, since they're now a force of habit. 
I don't know how much truth that holds, I don't know too much about adapting behaviors.

191,AmItheAsshole,"I'm really close with this online friend to the point where we've been dating for a bit. We're both in our early years of college and living with our parents. Thing is she's depressed in general and doubts herself more than anyone I've ever met. I'm always there to try and comfort and support her as best I can. Unfortunately, her anxiety got the better of her to the point where she feels like she's a burden to everyone, especially me. Nothing I say can change her mind about that, and she eventually broke up with me because she couldn't take it. To paraphrase, she told me she wanted time alone to work on herself. I understood her and accepted. 

As much as I love her, I know she's not gonna do anything. She's been depressed for as long as I've known her and nothing she has ever done for herself has fixed that. I encourage her to seek a therapist, but she refuses. I ask her to take the antidepressants that a psychologist once prescribed her, she refuses that too. Her reasoning? None at all, she's just stubborn.

Despite all this, she's a very intelligent person. Just has too much pride, I guess. So I thought that if I can't get to her, perhaps her mother can. I don't think she's that close with her, as her mother would've probably done something by now if she knew how depressed her daughter is.

I was close to contacting her using one of them, but I wasn't sure how immoral that would be.

Like I said, I love her, but I know that she's not gonna do anything on her own.

196,AmItheAsshole,"First things first English is not my native language and I'm on mobile, sorry for mistakes. Get some popcorn this is a very long one sorry for that but I think the backstory matters here. Shortened version

&amp;#x200B;

I started working as a caregiver in a hospital in March 2019. I loved my work and my workplace, enough that I started the apprenticeship as nurse in October 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I was a service assistant in that ward. I didn't get proper training as the other service assistant was ill for a few weeks. After 1 month I had my first weekend shift. I was wondering if I had to check the ICM (incontinence material) but since weve got set days I didn't check. (I was nevernever told if a patient needed more.) When I got back one of the caregivers showed me the cold shoulder so I asked her in private if she has anything on her mind I could improve. She didn't like that I didn't check ICM. Ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the other service assistant. I was her little maid for everything. When I switched to being a caregiver she didn't stop treating me like that. The straw that broke the camels back was when she told me to do one of her tasks as she took her jacket to go outside to smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks before I started my apprenticeship I was on shift with them(cold-shoulder-coworker and screaming coworker), and a friend of mine. It was the second morning I had to go to the bells all by myself. When we took our break my friend and I went to the cafeteria, when we got back someone said a patient needs help. My coworker got up and left, I thought she would go there, nope. I was angry because of the bells thing, nurse noticed and told my coworker. She got angry. 

After morning routine I was writing reports, when I finished mine I saw said caregiver already doing what i had in mind, so I did her reports. After that the nurse told me ""you come with me"" so I have no choice. 

I go into the 3rd room and see that it's messy and no beverages. Even tho my coworker just finished her beverages-round. I go to her to ask her if she has any plans for that room but that's when she starts screaming at me in front of patients ""you can take out a plate by yourself can't you"" I was taken aback and just left. Afterwards a little war started. At the end of the shift the cold-shoulder-coworker told me and my friend we are lazy and both nurses stepped in and said that's not true.

&amp;#x200B;

So now to the subject of this post. I don't care if they talk about me negatively with their coworkers or at other wards but after our first practical period a friend in class told me that people at my old ward are talking about me with them present even try to get them to talk about me too. They are uncomfortable every time. And I think this is too much. I don't like them talking like that about me to my classmates.

My husband is from a big family. I'm the only child of divorced parents. His family are very involved with each other: there's even a family group chat, spouses excluded. My family aren't distant, but we aren't like his.

When we started dating, there was tension from his mom. We live hundreds of miles away &amp; his job keeps him here. She hated that he stopped travelling home on weekends. I was his first girlfriend, he wanted to take me on dates etc, &amp; didn't have the money spare. I didn't realise it was an issue until our first NYE together. We were having sex; when we finished he had multiple missed calls &amp; angry texts from his mom because he hadn't phoned her at the countdown. Every year since, it's been imperative to stop whatever we're doing to call his parents.

First time I met them, his mom got drunk &amp; threw digs at me, saying I wasn't good enough for her son. Once engaged, we decided on a private ceremony (parents only) as we wanted to splurge on a honeymoon instead of a wedding. His mom wasn't happy, as it meant excluding her other children &amp; grandparents. No plan we made was good enough. I began to notice how my husband pussyfooted around her, saying ""yeah, I know,"" to everything. If I mentioned it, I was unreasonable, or I didn't understand because my family were never close like his. She sent many long texts moaning at him for not coming home, not contacting her enough - despite texting every day and FaceTime 2/3 days a week. Sometimes he'd call and she'd give him the cold shoulder. He'd butter her up, apologising and joking about it; enabling this possessive, juvenile behaviour. She'd say things like ""I'm not your favourite woman anymore,"" and ""I'm your mother, your real family should come first."" His older sister, who I've never met as she lives abroad, kept saying I had ""changed him"" and I heard her being rude about me on the phone. To clarify: I've never forced my husband to do anything other than what he wants, if he wanted to visit his family he could at any time. Eventually, he stepped up and stood his ground. Things cooled off a bit. She's still a helicopter mom, but from a distance.

My FIL is driving stuff down for us next week. Of course, I've offered dinner &amp; our spare room. However, my MIL has now texted me saying she intends to come along with my husband's kid sister. No idea what they'll do with the dog - it's poorly trained &amp; chews everything. Either way, I'll be cooking for 5 in a 2 bed, 1 bathroom house with nowhere for his sister to sleep. I only have a small dining table with 3 chairs &amp; I really don't want people eating off my brand new couch over my cream carpet. But I'd feel like a dick if I said no. I doubt my husband will understand why I don't want to host the whole Motley crew, feed them, find room for them and clean up after them. Is it unfair of his mother to expect me to play host?  Am I the asshole?  How do I handle it?",WIBTA for saying no to my mother-in-law?
198,AmItheAsshole,"Hopefully this doesn't get too long so I'll try to keep this brief!

I had my daughter six months ago. She's not the first baby in the family, my cousins (a family of four girls) all have had kids at this point. Now, I am not close to my cousins. I never have been, and I likely never will be as they live quite far away. They are an extremely close family and they have what they call their ""Mommy Swap Group."" Basically, they all share baby supplies with each other and just circulate it through the group as the kids reach the appropriate age. It's cute, it saves money and is better for the environment. 

When I had my daughter, they decided to involve me in the group. I want to be very clear here that they never asked if I wanted to be involved or talked to me about it in any way, I just started receiving packages full of baby clothes from my cousins. Every time my daughter reaches a new size, I get 3-4 packages stuffed with clothes, and each package contains between 15-20 items of clothing, so it's a *lot* of stuff. 

I told them when the first 6 packages arrived that it was unnecessary, that I was grateful but that they should keep them but they insisted and continued to send things. 

To be clear, I *always* write an email (we don't have each other's numbers) to whichever cousin has sent the box to thank them for them. I am always gracious and I do always mention that it isn't necessary and that they don't have to keep sending things.

However, none of the clothes thus far have been things I want to dress my daughter in. There's nothing wrong with them, they just aren't things I would choose. And between the items we purchase ourselves and gifts from my parents, my husband's parents and our friends who understand our taste better, we have enough clothes that I do like that I haven't ever needed to use any of these outfits. 

So, every time I receive a box I pick together an outfit out of some of the items, put my daughter in them for a photo, attach it to my ""thank you"" email and then I wash and fold everything and put it away so that when the time comes, I can pass them along to the next appropriate cousin. 

Last week, my aunt (my cousins' mother) called my grandmother and in the course of that conversation complained that I have upset all her daughters by being ungrateful, as my cousins have noticed that when I post photos of my daughter on social media she's never wearing any of their hand-me-downs. They feel like I don't appreciate being part of their swap group and that I'm being an asshole by not making an effort to post photos of my daughter in their clothes. 

It never occurred to me that they would care, as I have no contact with them outside of my thank you emails but now I'm left wondering if I've been an asshole for not being more grateful for the free baby clothes?",AITA for not posting more photos of my daughter in gifted hand-me-downs?
199,AmItheAsshole,"Backstory: I live in a city with a challenging housing market (expensive/fast moving). I have moved several times over the past 5 years and have advertised for roommates several times. I am a 20s female and was never interested in having a male roommate, so I would put “women only” in my ads. Every single time, men would respond inquiring about the room, and it became a particular irritation of mine.

Now, a friend of mine is moving and asked me to share her roommate ad. She is also mid 20s F and does not want a male roommate. She has “women only” in her ad and I specifically said “looking for a woman” in my accompanying post.

Wouldn’t you know it, the very first response is from a guy inquiring about the room. I’m so fed up with this being a constant thing that I respond and say “I don’t know whether you can’t read or just don’t respect boundaries because both the post and the ad say women only.” He called me an ass and said I could have just said no. I told him that men consistently don’t respect when women post roommate ads just for other women and it’s messed up.

We have a newer busser at work (it’s their job to clean and reset tables) who consistently will clear dirty plates off of tables and then leave the mess in the server area where we punch in food and have our work station. Tonight I got annoyed at the mess I was constantly cleaning up from her so I went up to the other busser who is her in real life best friend and asked her to remind her friend that she needs to clean up after herself, as the message will come across nicer from her. (I’ve been here for a long time, and I can be a little sharp when telling people to do better). Everything I’ve known about her up until this point is that her work ethic is utter shiiiet and has a bad attitude. 

The busser who isn’t that good at her job comes up to me 5 minutes later talking a mile a minute that she would appreciate me talking to her directly and not to gossip about her with her friend. I looked her in the eyes and said “I know you don’t know me, but I was doing you a courtesy as I thought her delivery would be better than mine.

I had a mid-term today and I was expecting my older brother to watch our 2 year old cousin while I went to university. My brother was not home when I woke up at 8am and I called him and he told me he got called down to his nursing placement. I was fuming because I couldn't leave my 2 year old cousin home alone. So I decided to bring her to my university 2 hours away. This was awkward during my fluid mechanics class because I had a test and the seatings were pre-arranged for the test to avoid plagiarism, so she couldn't sit in an empty seat next to me. I begged the prof to let her in and explained my situation, the prof seemed super chill and said that she can sit in his desk in the dead center front of the class. My worst nightmare came true, and that was her crying 20 mins into the test. I had to shush her, and I was not given extra time for killing time trying to calm her down.

203,AmItheAsshole,"So, my co-worker has announced that she is pregnant and is due to go on maternity leave pretty soon. Her baby is due sometime in February and every one of my co-workers except me has put in money for a baby shower. They have each contributed £10 (which is about $13 for those in the States).

I have been asked to contribute and felt that I was put in such a spot, I said ""Maybe. I'll need to check my bank balance."" In reality, I didn't want to contribute but didn't want to say it outright because of how it would look on me. I didn't say I would definitely pay though. I assumed they would just ignore me and leave me out from there. But they didn't. 
 
One of my co-workers put in £10 on my behalf without asking me first and now I owe him money apparently. I have stuck to my guns and said that I am not paying him and it's caused some tension between me and him in the workplace and he's saying that he can't afford to take his daughters' out for their birthdays because of me (which I know is bullshit). He keeps asking where his money is every time I start a shift and I've considered going to HR about it. He's been telling me that he'll escort to an ATM on the spot and it's just left me really awkward and uncomfortable, and I said this to him.

 I signed a card earlier wishing my co-worker good luck (just out of niceness because I was asked to sign the card before actually being aware that money was involved). I didn't know a card was a declaration to pay.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for my co-worker but I don't like to hand out money just so I don't like an asshole.

They haven’t seen each other or talked since high school, before my wife knew she was infertile. The subject of kids was brought up and my wife said she’s infertile. Her friend says “oh I’m sorry, have you looked into adoption?”.

I then say “I could never adopt”(my wife knows this, we’ve discussed it at length and are both happy with the conclusion). Her friends face turns sour and she looks away. At this point I’m wondering if I said something wrong, and so I apologize and say “sorry, did I offend you, I didn’t mean to”. She says she was adopted.

I then say that it’s nothing against adoption, and that I just personally don’t think it would be the same for me. This made it worse I think because she just looked away again and sort of cringed.

205,AmItheAsshole,"This is something that happened several years ago when I was in college, and a friend brought it up recently.

I was 22F at the time. A few friends of mine at the time were trying to help this one guy (60m) and only one of them had a car. I was with the other 2, Jay and and Vince, when one of them got a call from this guy asking for a ride. Since I have a vehicle, they asked me if I could drive them to pick up this guy, Cory. I agreed, since 8t would only be a 3 mile round trip max. On the way, Jay mentioned that Cory had drug addiction issues that had messed up his mind, so some of the things he'd say might not make sense.

Situation turns out that whenever I was around Jay or Vince and Cory called, they'd ask me to drive them.

The Friday before Thanksgiving, Vince sends me a text saying that he gave Cory my number, and asked me to spend time with him over Thanksgiving break because I would be in town and they wouldn't. I went to Corey's apartment once, but left as soon as he pulled out a Gideon's pocket New Testament and started acting like he was reading it, but actually was staring at me half the time to see if I was impressed with how 'Christian' he was being. I barely interacted with him, and he had a tendency of getting worked up and very angry about trivial things.

Later, Cory began calling me almost every day, up to 8 times a day, for 6 months. I would not answer at all. He'd leave voicemails saying ""Baby, baby! Why won't you call me back? I love you, baby! Call me back!"" I was on my parents' phone plan, and they refused to block Cory's number, but it wouldn't make much of a difference since he would change numbers every other month. (I had a non smart phone and to block a number, you had to go through the service provider and pay a monthly fee.)

I was not alright with Vince giving my phone number to anyone, much less a 60yo addict who was mentally unstable and somewhat volatile, and happened to have a crush on me. I politely told Vince I was uncomfortable with him giving Cory my phone number without my permission. Since then, I've politely cut off all contact with Vince.

206,AmItheAsshole,"This happened in late December. My dad is a narcissist. He is emotionally stunted from childhood trauma and acts like a 13 year old boy at the ripe age of 52, and I believe he is incapable of self-reflection. I (17) try not to react to what he says because he harasses me if I stand up for myself or disagree with him in any way, shape, or form. He especially likes to pick on me for being transgender, and constantly makes fun of my pronouns and masculine appearance. 

So, I was visiting him for the holidays and we decide to get sushi with an old friend (C) of his who I knew as a child. She's a delight, and I love talking to her. When my dad interrupts me, C stops him and allows me to speak. Soon, he starts going on about his parental trauma, for some reason, and is saying things like ""my dad is so reactive and never lets things go"" and ""my mother never supported what she didn't understand about me."" This is super ironic, considering he is constantly offended by any criticism and doesn't support my gender identity.

Now C and I exchange...a glance. We have apparently both experienced his hypocrisy. This is the catalyst. He goes quiet and is acting super moody throughout the rest of the dinner.

When we were in the car going home, he starts screaming at me. He's furious that she and I...looked at each other? He says that C is a drunk who had sex with his girlfriend and that when she gets drunk, she'll use my opinions of him against him. I tell him that this is none of my business and that I don't know why we're going out to dinner with someone he has such issues with. He says that I'm ""gaslighting him"" by making fun of him and not apologizing.

Finally I just tell him that I believe his statements were hypocritical because he makes fun of me for being trans (something he doesn't understand) and is super reactive. I tell him we were only having a little moment acknowledging that together. He just fumes while mumbling something under his breath.

I'm not entirely sure if I was TA. I know that he's a man-child, and I poked fun at him anyways knowing it wouldn't end well.

207,AmItheAsshole,"As a bit of context, childhood friend and I were very close as children but then lost contact for abt 10 years, they (among others) became very close to me for about a year and I really appreciated the friendship and the love I got from them all while we were close, then a couple of years ago I fell into a really deep depression and isolated myself to heck for roughly 2yrs straight, I lost my small business, I was supporting my mum in rehab, I lost a best friend but I continued to try and wrangle the situation for way too long and ended up with a bunch of debt I'm still paying off. During that time there was only a few people checking up on me, it would be a lie if I said I didn't have any hard feelings that childhood friend wasn't one of those people. But at the same time, I was also barely speaking to anyone/using social media/reaching out. The last time I spoke to childhood friend was maybe a year ago, we went out for dinner before I moved even further away from them (normally we are 3hrs apart, now we're a bit further) and I really wanted to reach out and apologise for being so distant and explain what had been happening w me and just generally have some friendship since it had been a long while.

FFWD to getting the wedding invite and I find out that the event is at a very ritzy location about 2.5 hrs away from me, it's a beautiful spot and probably the nicest one in our state. Since going out to dinner I hadn't heard from childhood friend until they message me telling me that I will need to purchase accommodation asap and that no one is free to share rooms with me anymore because it's getting too late (this was 8-9 months prior to event), they also mentioned that carpooling will be tough for me because they know that X friend of mine has a full car. I check pricing and ""early bird"" for the cheapest accommodation in the vicinity is $150 per night, I've been asked to stay for two. It's a lot for me at this stage in my life and I can't stop thinking about how $300 + food and transport is more than half of a down payment for a new rental which is 100% my top priority atm, I'm living out of a single room at my mums and it's full of all the gear I need for work and school. V uncomfortable.

Am I (36M) the asshole for being upset I didn’t get a plus one to my buddies wedding? 

In our group of friends (about 10 guys), everyone’s married/engaged. We’re all very close and see each other often, will all be hanging out all weekend at this wedding, which everyone is traveling in to be at. I’m divorced but now dating someone new but it’s not serious yet. Bride and groom have never met my GF. Everyone else’s partner was invited. I understand why my partner wasn’t, but I called and asked for a plus one. I was told no, only engaged/married couples are invited.  It’s not that I think my GF needed to invited but I don’t want to be the only one there without a date. Also I don’t get that much time off work and it’s an opportunity to get a weekend away with the GF. Spending a lot of money of this wedding (hotel, flight, suit for the wedding party) and it probably means I won’t be able to go away with her in the near future. 
I didn’t really care/sort of understood until I found out a friend of hers got a plus one for her BF.
I guess I’m upset for a couple of reasons. 
1) I don’t like that I’m the only guy in the group not in a serious relationship at the moment and bride and groom know it.  It’s been an issue I’ve been depressed about and saying no to a plus one and therefore being the only guy there without a date makes me feel like shit. It’s not their fault, but it affects how I feel. 
2) Her friend got a plus one (she isn’t in the wedding party), but I was told no. 

Just to add there is no issue of them thinking we will make a scene, cause any issues. Additionally, it’s a rather large wedding. I even offered to pay for her seat if it was a money issue (which I know it isn’t).

   Usually I drive out to her since she has no car which is sort of a hassle for me since it is kind of far and we usually see each other during night hours. I have told her my concern and she understands for the most part...
   The other day she asked to see me. I told her I’d love to but I did not feel like driving; I propositioned that she Uber to my house for a change. She replied with, “LOL are you gonna pay for it?”

My biggest problem is with my upstairs neighbors. I know the walls and thin in general, but I can hear everything they are doing. I have never met them, but based on their voices I think it is a heterosexual couple and a dog. I also think I have seen them leave the building from my front window, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen them up close.

Anyway, every weekend I hear them screaming. And I don’t mean a fight or sex or whatever. I mean I will hear the woman saying “no” and “ow” in a quieter way and the man saying something else and then the woman will let out a bloodcurdling scream. I have called the police before, but nothing seems to have happened, so idk what they said. But these all seem to happen after midnight when I am in bed and would like to remain in bed and not have to deal with my neighbors or cops.

Then today (and other days but today was especially bad) for hours it seemed like they were running around and jumping or banging furniture on the floor. It was literally shaking my apartment and it was *constant*. I seriously thought my apartment ceiling might cave in. 

They also seem to run heavily up and down the stairs. Based on the floor plan of the building, my living room is right next to the stairs, so I can often hear when someone is out there, but when I hear them on the stairs it is obnoxiously loud. I have no idea how someone makes that much noise on stairs.

So, I am considering knocking on their door one of these times that they are making noise and just asking if everything is okay because I can hear things.

My birthday this year fell around finals, so he was to busy to do anything for it and we celebrated by him making me dinner. He also gave me a couple small but thoughtful trinkets. Now his birthday is soon, and when I asked him what he wanted to do he named an expensive restaurant he really likes. I agreed and certainly don’t mind doing something nice since it is his birthday (I will be paying for both of our meals of course). But the issue is, I’m not sure I can spend $100+ on dinner and afford to get him a present too.

He said ""I clocked in then realized I left something at home so I left for an hour because that's how far away I live."" I just looked stunned. Like dude YOU LEFT WORK. I asked if he atleast told management and he said no. I was okay then you deserved it. I then went on with my day.

216,AmItheAsshole,"So last month I was going shopping with a friend (N)  for gifts for the holidays. I came across this thing, called a magic 8-ball or something, that you ask something and it will tell you no, yes, or something like that. It used to be sold for 6 euros, but they had it on sale for 50 cents, so I decided to buy some. I wanted to gift one to my sister, but came across a better gift, and the same story with a birthday of a friend.

So come today. We're celebrating the birthday of another friend (B), and I decided to gift her one of the 8-balls, with two other small things. All in all, it cost me about 3 euros, but I was happy with it.

Then we get to giving the gifts. I was the last one to give mine. B first opened the other two gifts and then came to the ball. B opens it, and N just starts laughing, like kind of snort-laughing, and keeps telling me I can't give stuff like that to people. She then proceeded to tell everyone I bought it for just 50 cents. I felt really embarassed about it. I thought it was a nice gift, and thought the birthday girl might like it, but when N said that I saw B's face drop a little. My other friends that were there also gave me looks like I was a cheapskate for giving her such a gift. 

However, later on, they did play with the ball and seemed to like it, but I just can't shake the feeling that I shouldn't have given her that ball, and should have just bought something else, or just left it out of my gift.

I kinda didn’t mind until she told me that tomorrow she will be going out with her again to try food at a buffet that will be served for the wedding.

So I then asked her if we would have any saturdays available to do things, and she said she would like to help her sister every Saturday until the wedding. I then expressed my frustration asking “every single Saturday you won’t have available”? She then says “well we hang out on the weekdays so why does it matter? Why is that day so special to you?” She also said she doesn’t have a life anymore. As if I’m forcing her to hang with me. 

So we get into a 30 minute stressful argument about how I think I think it’s stupid we can’t hang out on that day ever for 40 weeks straight. So now she’s ignoring me because she said I am making her feel bad and I am controlling. I told her I don’t care anymore if it doesn’t matter to you why should I care?

“And what’s more, you can’t fire me. You can’t fire someone who doesn’t work here. *I*. *QUIT*.” So I seized the moment and said “You’re quitting?” 

And this is the PG version but basically he said  “You’re damn right I am!” And I said “So you’re resigning your post, you are choosing to not work here anymore, you are leaving your job?” 

He said yes, he said a few other things, he left. I processed his removal as though he’d quit. I no longer had to pay him severance of any kind.

222,AmItheAsshole,"My fiancée and I are getting married at the end of February, after over a year of planning. I had asked my then-brother to be one of my groomsmen when we first got engaged, and he had been on board with it this entire time. 

However over the weekend (less than a month before the wedding) he “came out” to the family as transsexual. My fiancée was there at the time and was supportive, however he almost immediately brought up that he would like to “come out” to the rest of the family via our wedding, and would instead like to be one of her bridesmaids. 

My fiancée was obviously uncomfortable about this, pointing out the obvious time constraint, and how plans had already been made for the bridal party. Turns out, he had already ordered a very similar dress to the ones her bridesmaids are wearing from online, before even asking us.

Fiancée asked to speak with me alone and admitted she wasn’t comfortable with him as a bridesmaid. The rest of the group are her friends and sister, who she trusts to help her get dressed and made up for the ceremony, she doesn’t know my brother very well, definitely not well enough to want him helping to hold up her dress while she pees. I agreed with her.

I explained to him that the bridal party is just for my fiancée’s friends and family, but that he was still welcome to be a groomsman. He did protest that he thought it would be good “bonding time” for him and my fiancée, but agreed, as long as he could wear the dress.

And this is where I might be the asshole but I vetoed that too. I know if he wears a dress, instead of the suit we’ve already paid for, it’s at best going to completely distract from the wedding, and at worst start fights among the relatives, we don’t come from the most tolerant family.

I basically gave him an ultimatum to wear the suit he agreed to months ago, or not be a part of the ceremony. Our parents think I’m being too harsh, and that this is a chance to “show my support” but I refuse to do that at the cost of my and my fiancée’s wedding.

I would say I put in slightly more every week with the cleaning.  I would say there is one area of big contention, I make dinner for us usually 5 nights a week, my husband maybe once a week.  When I cook I expect my husband to clean up as I do when he cooks and so that I can cook the next night.  My husband always does a half-assed job when he cleans though.  Like for example he will load the dishwasher but not wipe down the counters or clean the sink.  

It’s very frustrating as I feel like I have to clean for 10 min  every time before I cook.  I have talked to him about this multiple times now.  But most nights I end up nagging him to do something, which he gets annoyed with too.

I am thinking about only cooking a simple dinner for myself moving forward, like a salad or eggs and letting my husband fend for himself.

227,AmItheAsshole,"I'm a 23 year old woman, living with my mom and stepdad and 17 year old step brother right now, for financial reasons. We live in the suburbs and I work in the city. Parking is kind of a pain in the suburbs, were allowed to park on the street, except we have to move our cars on garbage day (once weekly), recycling day (twice monthly), or street cleaning day (once monthly) and sometimes our neighbors get mad when we have too many cars in the street, making them park further from their homes or making it ""so hard"" for them to navigate out of their driveways.

We have a driveway to a 1 car garage, but it's only 1 car wide. So when my mom's car, my stepdads car, and my car, are all lined up in the driveway and garage, it's a juggling act to get anyone out... Move my car, move my mom's car, my stepdad can leave... Put my car and my mom's car back because it's garbage day... Now my mom wants to leave... Rinse and repeat.

So overall it's a pain in the ass to park at home. Made even more annoying because I mostly ride my bike to work so I keep forgetting to move my car and getting expensive tickets for being in the street on garbage day or street cleaning day or recycling day. I'm trying to lose weight and I've been biking almost every day for 6 months now. 

But my office has parking for everyone, it's in a private lot, and we can leave our cars overnight. No tickets, no having to move it, etc. I've been using my office as long term parking, and I checked with security that it was ok. They said yeah, just take a spot in the back corner.

Before I started leaving my car at the office, I'd occasionally let my family use it. Now that my stepbrother has his license, we've got four licensed drivers and three cars in the household. 

But now it's not so available; it's a 30 minute bike ride to go retrieve the car, and that makes using it pretty inconvenient. I only really use it to do long trips out of town. 

I don't borrow the other cars at all, but it is still causing problems at home. My stepbrother wants more driving time but he often can't use a car because my mom and his dad need them. Or when he does use one of their cars, they are frustrated about being stuck at home. 

And I'm getting blamed for leaving my car at work, when it's needed. I keep saying that if anyone wants to borrow the car, they can take the buses into the city, pick up the car, use it, and return it to my office lot. But I don't want to keep it at the house any more because it's a pain.

And apparently that's not an okay answer, the bus ride is so long (40 mins) that it's just not feasible. Plus my stepbrother is too new a driver to be confident driving in the city and he needs to have more time practicing in the suburbs apparently.

Now I’m highly allergic to dogs, so I did not and till this day, am not around his dog.  So my s/o obviously did everything for him, which he should. Since it’s his dog.  While living in Cali he had the time to play and spend loads of time with that dog. And give him proper medications. It was a cute sight to see. And they both seemed happy. But when he moved in with me to Maryland everything changed. We wanted to build a family. He took on two jobs. He would wake up  @4am and get back at 12am every day.  It’s been 4 years of this.  His dog does nothing but sit on the couch in the living room And cry, and poop/pee on dog mats. 

And it honestly makes me sad, that dog is too old to be living out his last days basically alone, because all my husband does when he gets back home at night is give him food and water. And go right to bed.  He doesn’t even take him outside.  I’d take him outside if we had a fenced in property, because that involves me not even having to really be near him. Or pick up his poop, but we do not. And there’s children and other dogs out there. I don’t want to have any accidents.  And I’m pregnant at the moment. And can’t afford to get sick. My immune system has always been crappy. And pregnancy makes it worse. If I’m around that dog for more than 1 minute, it’s over.  And I’m miserable for weeks.  

Last night I got sick of hearing that dog cry and moan for his owner as he does every damn day and night  and finally yelled at my s/o telling him to get rid of his dog. Give it to someone else that actually will give a damn, Because it’s clear he doesn’t have the time nor will put in any effort  for him and it shows. He’s been ignoring me for the whole day.

Edit due to theme of asking/questioning : last year i talked about this same thing to him, and he acknowledged he didn’t have the time, I was the one who found people that already had experience with his dog and loved him enough that they agreed to take him. My s/o was on board yet undeniably sad about it. Until the last minute. He backed out of it.   I’ve also offered him to hire a pet sitter, he claimed he didn’t want to spend the money on a day to day basis. I’ve tried to help the dog with suggestions to it’s owner. I genuinely do want him taken care of, and have gone out of my way to look for some alternatives. They’ve just been shot down.  (I’m avoiding re-asking the people who wanted the dog before hand because as of now, they’re going through a potential situation that may require their own dog to be put down due to old age, and asking them at this time just seems like a bad idea)

+ when he adopted said dog we were just dating 5 months in. I could not, and honestly did not have the authority over him adopting a pet when we didn’t live together yet (I was visiting him in Cali every few months) nor was married to him.  He agreed that the dog would be his responsibility only. Since he acknowledged I was allergic.",AITA for telling my husband to get rid of his dog

239,AmItheAsshole,"So I(19f) work at a restaurant to make some money beside university but since i still live at home i'm not dependent on the money.

Sidenote: My parents said they would support my decision to quit if the situation with my boss and coworkers gets worse.

A couple of month ago i started working at a fairly popular restaurant in my town. From the  beginning i immediately noticed that some of my coworkers didn't like me. Altough i made some friends with other coworkers and we even meet outside of work, three of my coworkers never warmed up to me.

Especially our only full-time employee (mid 20s f) has a lot of fun picking on me. Everytime things get a hint of stressed she immediately becomes a total bitch, but only to me. Then i have to do the dirty work, clean, run around like a maniac and whenever i have a question i would only recieve a snappy, belittleing answer.

I'm the only one she treats like that and is actually very nice to every other coworker. Since she works full-time i literally have to work with her everytime i work.

The second part i'm thinking about quitting are my bosses. The restaurant is run by a brother/sister duo and they can get extremely mean. A few weeks ago my boss hired three more employees and now we are overstaffed and pretty much fighting over shifts. This also gives my bosses the power to choose the servers they like at the moment and to make the other stay line because otherwise you won't make money.

Apparently i'm not in their good graces at the moment. Before the three new people were hired i worked two times i week which was perfect for me. Now i work once a week -if i'm lucky.

And even if i work everything i do is wrong to my bosses. What i say, when or when not i can work, what questions i ask, how i behave. Everything.

Last week everything got too much for me after my coworker treated me like sh*t the entire shift and my boss yelled at me in front if the entire staff for something i didn't even do. I went home crying after that shift.

I'm considering quitting my job of something like that would happen again, even if it would happen mid-shift. And its very likely to happen again. I don't need that job (or its recommendation) and i have my parent's support.

241,AmItheAsshole,"TL;DR in title
I was in a store just before, had checked out and was slowly being winched down the moving walkway to the bottom level (not an escalator but kinda, it didnt have steps) and this lady and her son come galloping down the incline and stopped directly behind us, indecently close really, and the only thing I heard out of her mouth was ""we haven't got all day.""

The last time I was in this store I was fat shamed because I tried on a dress, it was too big and I said I needed to get a different size to see if thatd fit. A guy, and his girlfriend, walked past just as I said it and loudly informed me that it wont, so I had some anxieties getting my clearly fat ass back in there. 

So anyway, irrelevant details aside, I man up, begrudgingly turn my fat head and say pleasantly enough, I'm fat, I'm lazy and I'm not moving. This lady looks shocked and says what?! I say I'm fat and lazy *and I'm not moving* she looks at me is disgust and says I wasnt talking to you, I was talking to him, it had nothing to do with yous. (Yes she said yous, gross.) So I smiled said ok and continued to be whisked downwards by this mechanical marvel and carried on my way. 

My question is: AITA for, correctly, assuming it was directed at me, given they were so god damn close and she said it as she stopped directly behind me?

242,AmItheAsshole,"I have a friend that kept following and unfollowing me on Instagram, and it’s been a very upsetting situation for me. Usually this does not phase me of course, social media shouldn’t be taken so seriously and it can mess with your mental health, but this is someone I know personally, we’ve spent a lot of time together, I went to his wedding party, and I always gave him business and follower advice or whatever he requested of me. A few years back I lost my social circle, so having him let be a part of his life was making me feel back to normal again. 

It mainly hurt so much because the first time he unfollowed me it came out of nowhere and after hesitating, I mentioned it to him. I told him how it made me feel but he dismissed it, saying it was just an accident, then next time he only wanted to follow meme/business accounts, or to have a good ratio(ie 10k followers but following 100 people), etc etc. This happened maybe 3 or 4 times. It never added up because, I was always the only person out of our friend group that he unfollowed everytime. It felt like a deep cut, like I made him mad even though he and I never had any issues before this. Anyway, he unfollowed me for like the 4th time and I just gave up and unfollowed him back, and nothing happened for a while and I was moving on. He didn’t talk to me or anything. 

Then last month I got request from a fake name on Facebook asking me to accept his friend request. It was him. I sent a carefully worded message about how I was confused and hurt by everything and why he wanted this from me now. He dismissed my feelings and said he always thought of me as a friend and said some religious stuff. I pressed further and put emphasis on that it wasn’t just some trivial social media beef, but that he made me feel like lesser than the rest of our friend group and just another piece in his algorithm for clout (I had/have more followers than him so everytime he asked me for advice I helped him the best I could). He never explained it but ultimately he did apologize and said he would stop ‘being petty like a female and work on repairing our friendship’. I didn’t really reply, but allowed us to be mutuals, even though I was wary. 

Then earlier this week he makes a new personal account, moved all our friends and my boyfriend to it except me, and wrote in the bio “I keep my friends close 💜”. I never said anything but I did cry and vent about it privately. Then yesterday abruptly he sent me that “aww shit, here we go again” meme and a message, but I can’t read it.

This i how it happened: (my memory of this all is a bit blurry)

We were at uni with 2 of my others friend((M24 and M23) + my friend(F23). We all talked and then she decided to go to the bathroom. While she was there, me and the others talked about games and mma for the most part, and then her phone calls! It has a picture of her girlfriend and one of them goes «who is that?». 

I answer by saying «thats May(Original)... i mean thats Brendan(New name)».( when i said her original name i slipped and tried to fix it by saying her now name.)

One of them ask «Why branden?» 

Then i try to explain why and i do stuggle a bit. She then comes out of the bathroom while i am explaining it to them. I just tell them to ask the main source instead(thats F23). She then explains it and i thought that was it.

The day after she asks me why i called her out like that? We got into an argument and i still dont know why she is upset by it.

244,AmItheAsshole,"So I have a friend, let’s call her Lucy. Lucy is going away for 6 months starting tomorrow. 

I texted Lucy earlier this week, saying we should see each other before she goes. She says ok, then I ask if she’s free Friday. Lucy says possibly and that she has to pack, so then I ask about Thursday, to which she says she’s busy Thursday. She later tells me: “Friday should be fine. I’m actually going to a restaurant with Sarah that night if you wanted to come by.” Sarah is a friend of hers who I’m also friendly with, but I don’t really hang out with her without Lucy. I tell Lucy I’d come to the restaurant. 

So Friday comes around, I ask what time they’re going, Lucy says she’s not sure, depends on Sarah and that they’re not gonna be there till later in the evening (she texts me this at 7:30 pm). At 9 pm I ask her if there’s any update, and she doesn’t say anything for about an hour after that.

She then texts me, “hi sorry Sarah and I are at the restaurant, I think she wanted to hang with just me tonight because we made these plans, but if you wanna come say bye to me you can stop by my house tomorrow.”

I asked Lucy if she told Sarah that I was coming too, and she says she did tell her. Lucy says it was their plan to go out to begin with so that’s why Sarah isn’t telling her this till right now.

245,AmItheAsshole,"My wife and I live in an apartment. Our landlord allows us two pets. We've had two cats for a long time. We found an injured, sick kitten trapped in a bush over the fall. We knew it would violate our lease to keep it, so we contacted 20+ rescues in our area to see if they could take it but they were all full. In the time we nursed the cat back to health, we came to love it and decided to keep it. We are planning to move out next year and figured we could keep the kitten a secret until we left.

A large crack appeared in one of our walls to the point where the wall is crumbling more and more daily. We called our landlord to see if they could fix it. I told the landlord they did not have permission to enter if nobody was home, which shouldn't be a problem because I am home all day during the day and could easily shoo our cats into a bedroom while they worked on repairs.

The landlord's maintenance man has been running late and blowing us off all week, and then finally showed up one day when I was out of the house for one hour, so they could not enter without me. They called my wife and told her they could not enter today without me home, so in order to get the job done quicker, my wife gave them permission moving forward to enter our apartment even if nobody is home. The maintenance person said they would return ASAP this week and let themselves in.

I had a big problem with this. I tried to explain to my wife that there's no reason to take the risk, and that she should not have gave the landlord/maintenance man to permission to enter without me for fear that they will see our three pets and cause problems since we are violating the lease. This conversation happened over text and seemed as neutral and diplomatic as all of our partnership and problem solving talks are. I never said she was wrong or did anything bad, I simply tried to convince her than even the 1% risk of the maintenance man letting the landlord know we have too many pets is too high of a risk for me. Being that both of our names are on the lease, I told her I wish she'd asked my permission before telling the landlord they could enter whenever, as this situation affects me and I should have had some agency in it.

My wife now seems pretty upset with me. She says it doesn't matter, that the landlord-employed maintenance man doesn't care if we are violating the lease, and  that we have nothing to fear since other people in other units have violated their leases before. I still maintain that since I am home from 9-5 every day and can supervise and control this information that we are violating the lease, that we should not let them enter without us and that it was a bad move to give the maintenance person an opportunity to see that we are violating the lease and potentially communicate this to our landlord. We are extremely poor and if we got kicked out of our apartment we'd be completely fucked.

Hope that all makes sense. I feel bad because my wife is really upset with me. Am I the asshole?",AITA for being upset with my wife that she gave our landlord permission to enter our apartment when we have more pets than allowed by the lease?

247,AmItheAsshole,"So, this weekend is my mom's birthday, the 26th of January. Lunar New Year is the 25th. My boyfriend is Cantonese and I've celebrated New Year with his family last year. This Saturday, my family planned to celebrate my mother's birthday on Saturday since we can go out to eat, invite some friends, and exchange some gifts. We were set on celebrating her birthday on Saturday, no other plans discussed. 

My boyfriend's family invited me to celebrate Chinese New Year on Sunday in New York. Usually, I like to inform my parents about any plans I have so I nonchalantly mention it to my mom, ""Hey, my boyfriend's family invited me to celebrate C.N.Y on Sunday.""

Her immediate response was, ""This Sunday? My birthday is this Sunday."" Her attitude changed from relaxed to irate.  I responded, ""yeah, but we are celebrating your birthday on Saturday, so I didn't think it would be a problem."" She goes silent, then says, ""I wanted to go to the spa with you on Sunday"". I have to add on, that my mother has a bad way of dealing with emotions, a bit of a narcissist, and overall not too compassionate with other people's plans. I kinda awkwardly leave the room since I didn't know what else to say at this point. 

Fast forward to before dinner time. My dad and I were in the car while my mom was still in the house, so I tell him whats going on. I say, ""Hey, I need to talk to you about something because I genuinely don't know if I messed up or not"" so he goes sure and I basically explain what I wrote above. Normally, my dad doesn't side with me since he likes to please my mother and avoid conflict with her but surprisingly he took my side, ""She shouldn't react like that, etc"" basically backing me up. He thought that it was childish she was reacting this way since Chinese New Year is an important holiday to my boyfriend's family and since they invited me I should go. 

Another fast forward, things become tense at dinner and when we get home she explodes. She starts yelling at my dad asking why he's siding with me and that she doesn't want me to attend her birthday party anymore. My father is trying to be reasonable and tells her ""Were not going to do that, you need to relax."" She comes up to my room and proceeds to call me a ""little fucking bitch"" and other words amongst that category and says ""What did you tell your father to make him take your side"" and ""You always fucking ruin everything"". I sat there without saying anything because honestly, I was too scared to do anything in fear that she would physically attack me.

Having just gotten engaged, I am so excited to be able to plan my wedding knowing my dad will be there to walk me down the aisle and be by my side on the big day!! Here is my selfish, assholeish dilemma: 

My fiancé’s brother got engaged a while ago and his parents told us that they were initially planning on having a 2 year long engagement. Surprise, surprise, that was false information and they’ve set the date for their wedding one week after my dream wedding date. This date is not just important to me, but to my family, and me getting married on said date would be really special as my grand parents were married on that date as well as my parents. I would love nothing more than to have 3 generations sharing a wedding anniversary in my family. 

All of my friends have said screw the brother and his fiancé, everybody gets ONE day, do what’s best for YOU, etc, but I know my fiancé feels we should wait an entire year if we want that date (could be Friday or Saturday) so as to not steal anyone’s thunder. However, my concern is that if we wait an entire year my dad will be in poorer health / unable to walk me down the aisle. I tried explaining to him the pain of caring for a parent with a terminal illness in your twenties is so surreal and painful. It literally makes my heart hurt to imagine walking down the aisle without my dad. I truly don’t think my fiancé will understand that pain until he is faced with the mortality of his own parents. 

I know if I do ultimately choose this date, we will have to sit down with my FBIL, FSIL, FMIL and FSIL to have a discussion about why we are having our wedding a week before theirs. I believe I would at least owe them that. Otherwise... I truly don’t see it being a never-speaking-to-them-again-scenario.

This is something that saddens me greatly as we have a very loving and comfortable relationship unless we get into an argument/fight, which lately has been happening every 3 weeks or so. I am not ok with how he treats me during a disagreement, he has anger issues (which he admits) and treats me very disrespectfully and hypocritically, he often tries to gaslight me during fights which I do not give into which only angers him more. 

I've told him that I refuse to discuss things any further at this point because it's clear to me that we have different perspectives and talking things out between us two isn't going anywhere. Everytime I try to talk to him about the things that are bothering me, I end up getting lectured/berated/yelled at for hours that ""he's not blaming me, but it's all my fault"" and I have to just sit there and listen to why/how he's upset, etc. I think it's incredibly unfair and so i'm insisting on us attending couples therapy, which thankfully he has agreed to. The problem is that it's pretty expensive, and i'm honestly not sure how soon we'll be able to go. 

We're due to re-sign our lease in a couple of weeks. Our landlord had originally given us a choice between re-signing a one year lease and keeping the rent the same or switching to a month to month lease but our rent would be higher, we had decided together awhile back that we would be resigning the year lease. However at this point, i'm having serious misgivings about our relationship. The way he's been continually behaving and treating me during disagreements isn't something i'm willing to put up with much longer, and I want to protect myself and make things easier for the both of us if we were to split up. This would of course be much easier if we have a month-to-month lease instead of a year. I emailed my landlord independently and he ended up saying that since he liked us as tenants and hoped we'd stay long term, he wouldn't be making any rent increases for at least 6 months if we do switch.

The thing is that he honestly does not see my side. I'm glad that he's willing to attend therapy, but if that doesn't work out I have very little hope for the relationship as much as I wish it would work out. I have a feeling he will be upset if I tell him about the month to month because he'll think I don't have faith in the relationship and with signing the month to month instead it's sending the message that I don't think things will work out.

I've been trying since the breakup to get more time with my daughter, a extra school run, anything at all to be with my daughter a little more. Each time I request I'm met with the same answer of ""it would be confusing and unsettling to our daughter for you see her on my days with her"".

I don’t care about that. 

Which leads me to my AITA moment. 
Once a week there is a lesson planned that requires two teachers in the classroom. I was assigned to be with Ana, which I didn’t mind. 
Because she’s been gone I’ve had to have the lesson alone every week except for 2 lessons. 
Today less than 1h before the lesson starts she texts me in our group chat that she won’t be able to make it because she has an appointment. I text her privately;

“I need you to tell me at least a day ahead if you’re not gonna partake in the lesson. It puts me in a uncomfortable situation when you cancel this quickly because I can’t find someone to cover for you. Also you’re responsible for finding someone to cover for you.”

She replies
“That sounds weird! Every other time you can and knows how to do everything on your own!”

It’s true that I have no problem to work alone but as mentioned this lesson is designed for 2 teachers. I reply that she’s being rude &amp; she tells me to read my message &amp; then judge if she’s being rude or not. 
She continues saying that I’m not her boss &amp; have no right to tell her what to do. I reply that I’m just asking her to partake or find a substitute. She replies that she’s covered lessons for me in the past and that I wasn’t complaining then, which I don’t understand being relevant and tell her that it’s not about that and that I’ve helped her in the past too. She replies that I have done nothing for her, which honestly really hurt me. 

It ends with her saying that she’s gonna change groups &amp; be with another class and that the original teacher in that one should be assigned to my group, &amp; I tell her that she is being ridiculous. Firmly stating that this should not affect the kids. No reply.

I text her a few hours later asking what happened, trying to figure out why it made her so upset but she didn’t reply. 
I’m feeling like an gigantic asshole and honestly I’m not sure why I do but I just do. I know she’s going through a lot at home, but I can’t decide if I came across as insensitive and rude.",AITA for asking my co-worker to give me notice in advance before missing a lesson.
255,AmItheAsshole,"2 days ago the only moderator of the discord (we’ll call him David) added someone (we shall refer to him as Ed) to our discord server who none of us had knew on discord. After asking him and talking to him, we found out he is a student at my joint middle school and high school (the whole group was in high school, and Ed was in the 8th grade), this meant that none of us knew him too well and only knew him from group projects. At this point I talked to our moderator and found out that Ed had found out about our discord from an overheard conversation and had afterwards constantly asked David (our mod) for access to the server. David eventually let him in without the discord’s permission. Since Ed was let in he has made very many low quality posts (e.g. stealing from google/ifunny, horrid cropping, bad grammar, and lots of “random” humor) this has gotten very annoying and I accidentally posted in our main chat a few sentences about how he shouldn’t have been let in (this was intended to be sent to David) “omg David why the hell did you let this kid into our group. Not to be rude or anything but he obviously doesn’t belong here.” Afterwards I felt terrible realizing I made a grave mistake. I sent a sorry message to Ed “Hey bro, I’m just gunna say I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for you to see that. I shouldn’t have been a dick. It’s just that the server is a for the friend group, I’ve never talked to you before, and your here out of nowhere with low-effort posts.

259,AmItheAsshole,"This happened literally an hour ago and I am triggered af. Curious of others opinion:

So I am the office manager for a small company. I decided to finally clean the freezer out of all stuff that isn't being used anymore. Over the past few years we have gone from 70ish employees to about 18 so there are plenty of things left from employees of the past. I mentioned last week that on Thursday of this week I would be cleaning out the freezer and to make sure they mark the frozen items they don't want thrown away. I also mentioned it Monday at the  morning office meeting that everyone has to attend everyday. Today (Thursday) I mentioned it again at the meeting. I even Slacked everyone  a half hour before I did to let them know in case they hadn't got around to it. Fast forward to after I cleaned it - a coworker on his way out asked if I threw away a PowerBowl from the freezer. I told him I did and then FLIPPED and said he just bought it today and it shouldn't have been thrown away.... Went to his boss and told him I was being unprofessional because I got an attitude when he asked. Mind you I only got one once he started with me...He said it was the ""principal"" of it and that it was stupid to throw away an unexpired item. 


TL;DR: AITA for throwing away his newly bought frozen meal after warning everyone I was cleaning the freezer?

Edit: forgot to mention I just started three weeks ago - if that is relevant at all to your decision making.

Edit 2: I am genuinely grateful anyone who offered their opinion. I feel better about it. I'm just going to treat this basically as  a lesson to put a warning on the actual freezer next time so I don't even have to question if I'm  the asshole. I will admit I'm like 22.67% the asshole here - and I venmoed him the $5 for the food.

I’m 18 and my sister is 19 and our parents are both 39. Now that we have that out of the way we can focus on what happened.

We had a family gathering for my grandpa’s birthday yesterday and many of my aunts and uncles and cousins were there too. They are usually held at my grandparents and so were they this time too.

Two of my cousins had gotten a ride from my uncle but he had already left with his family so they couldn’t go with him. We basically had to take them both with us. They are boys and ages 15 and 16. As you probably have figured out we only have 5 seats and we are 6....

My mom decided that my sister could sit on my lap for this one hour trip . I was very nervous but I decided to go with the flow.

I struggled to not get a boner but after around 20min I got one because she was sitting right on top of my stuff and there were bumps in the road. She didn’t tell me about it in the car but she told mom and dad when we came home.

262,AmItheAsshole,"Alright, so met my GF 3 years ago. We are both doing the young professional thing. Climbing the ladders and all that jazz. We met at a hiking meet-up and just really hit it off and have been together growing ever since. So, last year I moved in with her and have been making an hour long commute to my drive. I decided to move in with her because she had bought a house before we started dating and it would be easier for me to move in leaving my apartment than her selling her house.

So, boom. About 2 months ago she gets like an interview at a place for a job of a lifetime. It's a grueling intensive interview process and she was so stressed during all of it. I supported her the best I could through all of it not to take any credit from her though because it's all her hard work paying off to get her that opportunity. The timing kinda sucked because of the holidays slowing down the interview process. What's great is her new job would be literally 5 minutes from mine and she'd almost double her take home pay, so we'd be able to move making things so much easier for us.

So, she had a girls trip for a bachelorette party with some friends last week in Chicago. I knew the friends in question she was visiting liked to smoke weed and I told her make sure she stays away from it since she'll have to drug test in case she got the job. Especially with it being legal there now I'm sure they all would be smoking. She agrees not to do it.

She goes comes back Monday. And, we are hanging out then she gets the email that the company would like to extend an offer. We are friggin' ecstatic. Salary, job, location was perfect. Then, at the tail end of the email it says she has 48 hours to accept, and once she does she has to schedule a drug screen within 48 hours of accepting. She turns as a pale as a ghost and I'm like, ""there's no fucking way you smoked... did you?""

She starts stammering, and making up excuses. I'm going to be honest I was pretty livid this was a big deal for us. I know it's her job, but it would helped us out so much as a couple and knowing she lied to me about it sucked too. After talking a bunch I tell her ""I'm not breaking up or anything but I think I'm going to look for a place closer to my job because if you can't go a weekend without smoking to help us out as a couple why should I keep waking up 5am to go to work just to get home at 8pm."" I was starting to leave just to get away from her and she called me an asshole.

So, AITA here?

Edit: I keep seeing people say most jobs don't care about drugs and especially not weed. That may be true. But, for a 100% fact this one does it's literally listed in the initial paperwork of what could lead to withdrawal of the offer the same as if they found out she committed murder in the background check.

Edit 2: Also, we had talked about the location at length during the interview process how it would make things more convenient and we could spend more time together with shorter commutes. Along with we are pretty serious so engagement and a bigger house for a potential family are in the talks as well. This would've jump started things so much for us.

He has started taking it randomly for all day or days and not saying anything to me. the past two years of sharing the car he has guilted next every time into dropping everything and bringing it to him like a personal assistant. He lives less than a 5 -7 minute walk to the car and it takes me about 2 minutes to walk there myself. 



My brother (20M) and I (22F) stupidly share a car our parents bought us. It’s brand new and we share the payment and gas equally. I alone pay the $65 a month garage fee to make sure it is in a covered spot during our snowy season. 

I would’ve preferred to have two separate “lower” quality cars than share a car but I ain’t gonna complain about having the support from them to get one with having their name on the auto loan until we pay it off. 

This summer we will be selling it and splitting the money to each get our own car as I am moving to a new state after I graduate from my masters program and he is staying behind at school. 

He continuously asks me to drive him over the car as it is in my garage but he is less than a 5 minute walk from the car. Each time he asks I drop everything pretty much and bring it to him or ask him to wait 20 minutes so I can finish my task or food then head over. After he does his errand or whatever he’ll either keep the car or drop it back off and I take him home Park it then go back inside.

I’ve been always bit more quieter and more relaxed. 

We went to different sixth forms and this is where I think she started to copy me. This isn’t me trying to be obnoxious about I’m so great it just started to feel uncomfortable. It started with smaller things like I’d cut my hair short then she would, I would go on city breaks and she would go to the exact same places. My favourite series would be her favourite, and even people started to comment on her copying my sort of sense of humour and mannerisms. At first I literally just thought oh well, usually happens in friendships and I don’t own any of these things plus it’s nice to have more things in common.

Maggie is the only one among us who did not stay after 6pm during this period, as she has 3 children at home and she also took 3 days off during Christmas to bring her family to her hometown. While I don't judge her for that, it is apparent that she did not contribute as much to the company during the festival period as the rest of us.


Since the busiest time are over, I felt that I should show appreciation for the team for the hard work and bought 9 boxes of(rather expensive, even for staff purchase) imported chocolates from the company.

271,AmItheAsshole,"One of my neighbors, though I am not 100% sure who, has two small dogs that they let outside every day. They just open the front door and let the dogs roam the neighborhood to do their business multiple times. One of the dogs, a grey male, poops in everyone's front yard. When you try to shoo him away, he will growl and lunge forwards at you. To my knowledge, he has not bitten anyone yet. 

We also have a lot of stray cats in the neighborhood and one of my friends runs a cat rescue. She knew my husband had a small live trap and asked me to start catching the cats so they can, at the very least, be spayed/neutered and released. So I did. The trap is always baited when I am home and I've caught quite a few cats that ended up being able to be adopted out.

Earlier this week, the grey dog went into the trap and I let him out to go home. This morning, he was in the trap again and I got a really good, close look at him. He looks to be an older dog, has cataracts, and a large mass on his side that I would guess is an abscess. He also smells very strongly of infection and his fur is matted. I, again, let him out so he could go home but the minute I did, I regretted it.

It's very obvious to me that the dog is not being properly taken care of and I highly doubt he is up to date on his vaccines, if he even had any in the first place. So, I decided that the next time he got in the trap, and I'm sure he will, I'm going to call animal control to pick him up. Even if I knew for sure which house he belonged to, I highly doubt talking to the owner would do anything but piss them off. There is absolutely no way that they think this dog is healthy and that he is being properly taken care of. 

I told my husband of my plan and he said that was really shitty of me. He pointed out that the dog would probably be euthanized. The more I thought about it, I realized he was right. The dog clearly has issues that the shelter may not have the resources or money to deal with. But at the same time, the dog is not being taken care of and could easily be hit by a car (we live right outside a large city).

Right now, I still think I will call animal control when the dog shows back up but knowing that he very well may be euthanized is eating at me.

There were only 3 people in it. The bartender and two girls I know. Now I wasn't really expecting to see them there so I went and said hello. I immediately noticed that they were angry and irritated. I didn't know why but I started a conversation with them (Big mistake). I asked them what they were doing, how their day was and why they were so annoyed. They didn't feel like talking and I got mostly vague answers. I realized that they weren't in the mood so I left them alone and sat on a chair that was really close to them. I got a beer and started to dick around on my phone. Nothing really interesting was happening and my battery was low so I turned the phone off and started to stare at the wall pointlessly. I was pretty much lost in thoughts. 

Apparently one of the girls got really offended by that because she thought I was staring at her. She came to me and told me that I should leave. I was confused and asked why. She said I was ''getting on her nerves''. After she said that I actually laughed a bit. Me laughing actually got her even more annoyed. I told her that I don't really want to cause any problems but I'm not gonna leave a bar just because she was feeling irritated.

Eventually she started to piss me off and I told her that she isn't interesting nor attractive so there really isn't a reason for me to look at her. Now after I said that she started to look at me menacingly and actually said that she would break my jaw. 

My reaction was literally this: ''Who do you think you are? I get that you're having a bad day and something is clearly upsetting you, but you don't have the right or justification to vent that crap on me.''. She started to threaten me and call me some dumb names but the bartender had enough and suggested that I leave. I want to make it clear he didn't ask me nor force me, he just said it would be smart to leave and come back later. I said no. I'm a paying customer and I haven't done anything to escalate this situation. I told that girl that things don't have to be the way they are and we can just shake hands and forget this happened. She didn't want to hear it and stormed off with the other girl and told me to ''Watch my ass''.

The bartender started to lecture me about how he doesn't want trouble at the establishment and I should have just left and not made things difficult. I was a bit baffled by this. I told me him that he's an asshole and left. I didn't want to argue anymore.

Later on someone told me that the bartender apparently was good friends with that girl (News to me) and he knew what was troubling her and didn't want to upset her. Apparently the girl was kicked out   
 her parents house? Not exactly sure if that's true or not.

My mom who is 39 put the movie on and told me that she would come back in a moment. I of course waited and watched the movie a bit but decided to pause it and scroll through Reddit on my phone. 

After like 15 minutes I started thinking ”WTF is she doing?” and went into my parents’ bedroom . Well yeah they were doing that stuff and it was obvious.

I just closed the door quickly and shouted to my dad telling him to get done quickly so I could watch the movie with mom. I know that I might sound immature for an 18 year old but like I really wanted to watch that movie with her.

I went back to the couch and my dad soon came out and was all mad at me and told me to never act like that towards him.

My grandfather's sister has recently passed away this week. My aunt and grandparents have been travelling every day this week and always come home late at night.

My family told me that everyone is required to go and that we will be home late at night.

I don't want to go because of my busy schedule, I have a lot of schoolworks to do and I don't want to cram it the last minute because my works (works also involve group projects) might turn to shit. Plus this semester is very quick that's so there's no room for any late submissions.

Another thing is that the school and my family requires me to have an 85 and above on all subjects. 

I also don't know the relative quite well, I know I should pay my respects but I'm not really sure if I can just.. cram it into my schedule for someone who is a stranger.

276,AmItheAsshole,"I know that what we will do is not illegal and we’re not going to break any law in the process, but coming from a traditional and religious family, my dad wants to know really before we proceed with it.

Ten years ago my dad bought a piece of overgrown land near a heavily forested mountain about 20 kms (12,5 miles) from where we live for a surprisingly low price. The previous owner reasoned that the lower price was because the location was deemed ‘not strategic ‘, and not to mention the uneven terrain. My dad decided to purchase it because he believed that within the next ten years, our little city would expand due to the recent discovery of crude oil (it was only rumour at the time) in the countryside of a neighbouring village, in which the land is located.

Anyway fast forward to five years later, the rumour had been proved to be true. My dad hired some people to clear the land and they found a decades-old tomb and nobody in the village knew anything about it. The inscription on the tombstone was barely readable except for a male first name (Nicholas) and the date and year of death and some quote from the bible. We asked around and even put up a board sign on the shoulder of the street in case some passers-by knew about it or who it belonged to so they could come and claim it (to relocate it hopefully), but until today nobody has. I had tracked down the death records in that year in the area but found nothing so we consulted a lawyer and were told that according to the local law, we can’t exhume, let alone relocate a body, without the consent of the deceased’s family or relatives. In cases where nobody claims to be the family or relatives of the deceased, we still have to wait for 5 years to legally and properly relocate it, which brings us to now.

Somebody has offered to buy the land so my dad went to talk with the village headman and the elders and was told that according to the traditional and religious customs it was highly inappropriate (though not illegal) to relocate the body without the family’s consent in fear of disturbing the dead man’s soul. They asked us to wait another year. My dad, being a devout Christian, took it to heart. But I still insist that we stick to the plan since they offer no solution at all other than waiting. Besides, we will legally and ceremoniously relocate it to the town’s cemetery (despite the village’s protest). Now that somebody wants to purchase it triple its original price (he knows about the tomb and expects us to relocate it) we can’t wait any longer. So WIBTA if we relocate the grave? Do we sound like a bunch of greedy money-hungry people like some of the people in the village have told us?",WIBTA if I relocate a tomb on my family land eventhough it is considered inappropriate by some?

278,AmItheAsshole,"  So I'll try to make this brief. I've (37f) been with my guy(39m) for just about 3 years. I have one son from a previous marriage and we share an almost 2 year old. We've lived together almost a year. The first year after our son was born I claimed him and my oldest when doing our taxes with the understanding that we could switch off years claiming our shared child. That first year I got a significant (over 10k) amount of money. I paid my oldest sons tuition, gave my guy 2 grand to pay off a credit card, and paid for us to get a townhouse together, as well as bought a new bed and mattress, couch, table and chairs, dishes, vacuum etc. basically everything we needed. I spent over 5k on getting us into our home, and paying the first months rent and things that we needed. I make slightly more then him through out the year but I also have more disposable income. my car is paid off, low ins rates, both credit cards etc. We sit the Bill's and rent equally, but I pay for our joint sons daycare expenses myself. which equal about 900 dollars a month. Now tax time is coming up again. I asked him if it was ok if I claimed our son again, with the same situation as last year. giving him money towards his debts etc. With the left over money (about 1500) I planned a trip for the 2 of us to take. Now we are trying to plan excursions on this trip and hes arguing, well how much does that cost, is it more then this... and I'm getting frustrated because I'm not asking him to pay for anything. I'm using the rest of the tax money after giving him money for his Bill's, paying off childcare and school expenses for my oldest and taking this trip. tonight I told him that I'm not asking g him to pay for anything and Its my dream and I dont expect him to pay for my dreams. and he said well I'm letting you claim our son for the 2nd year, it's not just your money. You're acting like you're paying for all of this yourself. and I was kinda blindsided. 1. I didnt mean for it to come off that way and I apologized. 2. I pay much more then him through the year for our sons daycare costs that I dont expect him to pay for because I have more income that's not reserved for other Bill's. I'm ok with that. but also that being said i am technically head of household and i should claim both boys because i make a higher income. was i wrong? I apologized for how I said it but I dont think I'm wrong in thinking the way I do necessarily. thoughts?? thanks for the read

281,AmItheAsshole,"I spent the last year living in Japan where, fresh of of college, my parents agree to help me with my car payment for 6 months. I paid all other bills. I chose to stay an extra month in SEA and I started paying for that car when I got back and payed the extra month of car payment as it was not a part of our deal.

My mother convinced me to get a job with a school district while I started graduate school (I started school when I got back for Japan, paying for that on my own). This job pays very little but is great experience. I also work part time as a server on top of going to grad school FT. In exchange for taking this job, my parents told me I could live at home and watch my little brother (16) who has autism and those hours would go towards my car payment. I pay every single bill of mine except for the mortgage and utilities and health insurance (I can stay on until I’m 26, I’m 23 now. I offered to enroll myself in my jobs insurance because they offered a decent rate and my parents said they didn’t mind keeping me on insurance). 

My boyfriend of a year and I met while I was in japan and he is honestly the greatest bf ever. When I came home, we had to go long distance for job and visa reasons but we are trying to close that gap. I get paid year round for my job and he offered for me to come to Australia for the whole summer but I talked him down to 6 weeks. I brought this up to my parents and they think that I am absolutely taking them for a ride, not paying my dues, and because I’m not staying here to work as a server (on top of my year round pay) and saving money, I am completely irresponsible and they are threatening to kick me out if I go, saying I can’t just come and go as I please. I was planning on paying all my bills for the six weeks I would be gone. They are very much against my relationship and have always been very controlling. He is paying lots of money to come here in March to meet them and my parents say they don’t see a point because we are never going to actually be able to be together (which isn’t true).

I really want to see my boyfriend but I’m also to the mindset that when I get breaks to go somewhere or opportunities to do them, I should do them because I’m young and one day I am going to get my brother and be his caretaker when they pass. I love my brother and I am 100% okay with this and accept this as my responsibility , but I’m also very much child-free and I would like to do all the things I want to do before I have to be his caretaker day in and day out. I wouldn’t want him to go to anyone else. I got upset expressing this my parents and they think I’m being emotionally immature and out of line for thinking this.

282,AmItheAsshole,"I'm an accountant and my wife is a housewife. We have been married for 3 years. She has a kid from a previous marriage, he is 11 years old, and I have a good relationship with him. My wife's ex-husband remarried too and now they have a little  daughter with his wife. (I don't know how old is the girl, but I think around 3-4)

My step-son sees his dad at least once a week, but also everytime his dad, his dad's wife and his little sister make plans, they include him. And that is awesome, don't get me wrong.

Everytime my wife and I need a babysitter, she always call her ex-husband first, to see if he can take care of my step-son and only if he is not available she calls a babysitter. I never felt comfortable with this  because I felt as if everytime I make plans with my wife, we always informed her ex-husband. I would have felt more comfortable if we hired a babysitter first and only had the ex-husband as a back up plan.

Recently, I found out about a better job opportunity, but it's in the other side of the country. I would be making almost twice as much as I'm making now and I would be in a better position. It's not a sure thing yet, but the posibility is there. When I told my wife about it I thought she was going to be happy, but instead she said it was not possible.

She said she didn't want to move to another state because she didn't want to take my step-son away from his dad. That kind of pissed me off, because I'm her husband and it kind of felt as if she was putting her ex-husband's needs above our family well-being.

I told her that, and she got mad and said it was not about her husband, it was about my step-son who adored his dad and little sister and it would be hard for him to be away from them. I understand that, but kids adapt pretty quickly and it's not as if we live in 1950, he can still call them and text them and see them on vacations.

Then she told me that if we move to another city, she won't be able to leave my step-son with his dad when she needs someone to look after him, or call our regular babysitter. I told her how I never felt comfortable leaving my step-son with his dad when we want to make plans because that feels as if I have to let her ex-husband know everytime we make plans and that the kid is 11 now anyway and he is too old for a babysitter, since the city we are planning to move to is a fairly safe city.

I tell her I didn’t know that, or notice the conflict on set. So I was surprised. She elaborated a little, and I was shocked. 

I respond “I guess they must have their reasons, so I’ll take your word for it” she replies with “sure 😅” and links a Reddit thread about it. Full of some of the info she gave me. I’m surprised, had no clue, and express my shock.

We go back and forth about moments where the cast was at odds, and  that in retrospect I can see what she’s getting at. She sarcastically thanks me for seeing what she’s getting at. And I express that I’m not very observant.

And she says that it’s “me not believing her when she tells me something”. And then it was a bit down hill from there. But not the first time it’s happened.

Admittedly when she tells me things I don’t know, conflict with what I do, or that I’d like to know more about I don’t take it at face value. I want to know more.

So every year, I tend to not actually care about my birthday and Christmas. To the point where I'd just as happy being at work than being at home on these days. Even as a kid it meant little to nothing to me.

But nearly 3 years ago, my mum died the day after my birthday. And since then, both Christmas and my birthday  mean even less to me. To the point I only do stuff for other people.

Which brings me to my current issue. This year I'm 30. Something my sister and my girlfriend all insist is a birthday I need to do something big for. I however, just want to stay in bed all day. 

Now bare in mind, I don't drink or do any drugs. So partying isn't my thing. They're trying to compromise and just go out for dinner, which again, I'd rather just stay in bed.

I had built a sort of a rapport with one of them and one day, she PM'd me out of the blue to thank me for following her.

I obviously thanked her back for all the free content over the years and we had a little chat, at the end of which she told me ""If you're ever interested in something in particular, then I'd be happy to make it happen. This is my pricelist"" and she sent me a copy-pasted message of her services.

Now, even as much as I had enjoyed her posts, I personally didn't value them enough to pay for. In fact, that's not something exclusive to her, I just never found any logic behind paying for porn when there's *petabytes* of free stuff out there. So I politely declined, with a simple ""Thank you for the offer, but no"".

But then she pressed on and offered me a 20% discount, which kinda annoyed me a little, cause I generally don't really like people who press on after getting declined. It kinda reminds me of telemarketers or other types of salesmen, which are professions I have absolutely no respect for. 

Like, do I need something? I'll come looking, don't try to create a need for me. And even if those scummy tactics don't work on me, they work on others and it's definitely kinda shitty when you're selling practically useless stuff to people who don't have a real need for them.

287,AmItheAsshole,"Hi all, throwaway that I made (today!) specifically to start using for things that happen to me as a full time K-12 music teacher.

My 7-12 Chorus students attend lessons on a weekly basis, in addition to rehearsal every other day. The content for the lessons changes fairly regularly- started out the year with sightsinging exercises in different forms, then section work on concert repertoire, intervals, key signatures, reading music, etc. I have students doing written work, singing work (obviously), things on the staff board, things on the Smartboard, stretching and focus activities, playing with instruments in the room meant for elementary classes, lots of different activities. Lately, I have been implementing a “wellness for musicians” kind of unit into lessons. The first 10-15 minutes of the 45 minute period have been spent doing things such as yoga, breathing exercises, guided meditations with a focus on breathing and inner peace (not super-spiritual guru inner peace, just basic peace that 12-15 year olds need more of), and short discussions on how outside life contributes to ability to make music. Overall, my students have been really enjoying this and asking if we can start with yoga or one of the other wellness-based activities again.

I have one student, a boy, who is not into it. He is struggling across the board socially and emotionally, and has been all year, but at an increasing level lately. He has been refusing to participate during rehearsal, and in other classes (as other teachers have said in discussion on how to help him better), and refuses to participate in lessons if other students are present and becomes very hostile. If he is one-on-one with me, he is very open, talkative, friendly, wanting to connect, and can connect easily with me- we share a massive love for Star Wars and cats. However, with other students around, he is increasingly become hostile with me. In regards to the yoga and meditation activities during lessons, he just says that he “doesn’t do” yoga or meditation or stretching or whatever. He has not said it makes him uncomfortable, or that he does not like it, or anything else for that matter, just that he “doesn’t do” it. For the past two weeks, it has escalated to the point of me telling him he has the choice to either participate, or go back to class and not get credit for the lesson. I have other students waiting and need to be working with them, as well. Both times he has chosen to go back to class.

The teacher in me tells me I am not TA, because the student is just choosing to not do the work (this is applying to written and sung work lately, as well), and does not have a disability or other reason to be allowed to miss work. The human part of me who relates closely with my students is feeling very sad, though, so...AITA?

289,AmItheAsshole,"I, 22M am the middle child with a sister who is 24 and one half brother who is 6. 

My ""parental units"" have consisted of many different people. Mostly my grandma took care of us. My biological father is a dead beat who've I've never met and has a lot of kids with a few different women. None of which he supports.

So, growing up, It was my grandma, or a baby sitter taking care of my sister and I a lot because my mom would be away at work or with one of her boyfriends, usually. My mother had a few boyfriends throughout the years, one of which (We'll call him D) was around a lot. He did things ""For my sister and I"" but im positive he just wanted to look good towards my mom because when he babysat my sister and I he would just lock is in the upstairs bedroom and told us not to come out. The one time I did, it was to ask for something to eat, I got chased up the stairs.

My mom was with D for 10 years the first time. He cheated after being engaged to my mother. They split for like 5 maybe 6 years. D would marry some other woman and beat her.

My sister and I moved into my grandmas apartment, my mother bounced between that apartment and staying with whichever dude she was with.

In 2012 my mom and D got back together.  In 2013, my half brother was born. My mother stayed at grandmas with the baby where my sister and I still lived. She didn't stay at D's house because he ""Needed sleep"" for work. But this was an almost every night thing. So I did the part he wouldn't do which was get up with the baby, change his diaper, feed him, whatever. My sister watched him 5-6 times a week on top of working part time. Same story for me.

D clearly never wanted to be a father. If you point that out to my mother though, she ALWAYS defends him no matter how wrong he may be. Just makes up excuses like ""Well you know he has a temper"" or ""He hurts my feelings all the time. Get over it"" 

D and my mom like to go out twice a week on top of having my sister or I watch our brother while they work. If we say no to watching our brother so they can go out, they freak out and act as if we're ungrateful. 

Fast forward. 2018. My grandmother passed away. My sister and her boyfriend moved back into my grandmother's apartment to help me pay the rent/utilities. This seems like it would be fine but no.

They treated the place as a dump, made my living situation absolutely miserable because of filth they would leave behind and how often I had to clean up after them. We started to get ants and rats. I would ask nicely for them to clean up their stuff but that got me no where.

Now, I say no anytime they ask me to watch my brother and every time I do they guilt me saying that ""We've done so much for you"" or ""Why can't you do something for us"". They say it isn't score keeping but that's what it sounds like.

D texts me one day telling me that I'm a piece of shit, he's so much better than I am, I'll never amount to anything and that I'm the dissapointment of the family.

So, Reddit, AITA?",AITA for no longer speaking to my family?
290,AmItheAsshole,"Context: I'm a college senior who is taking a big shift in career decisions. I need to support my family after I graduate, so I decided to quickly change my major to CS. I live upstairs w/ parents, Sarah (sibling) lives downstairs with her SO and son.

My nephew comes upstairs all the time and plays with my dad, and Sarah does not watch him at all because she assumes that my mom/dad/I will watch him. The issue is that they make a ton of noise, and I can’t focus. I can’t study elsewhere because I’m easily distracted by people/noises (so no coffeeshops or libraries). At home, however, I can focus. When I'm trying to think through a coding problem, my thought gets interrupted by loud laughter, screaming, and running. I've asked my dad to quiet down, but that doesn’t stop anything. I've tried drowning out the noise with music, but I can't focus with music on. I'm just one of those students that work really well when it's silent. I've tried closing my door, but I can still hear everything. 

I told my parents that I can't have this happening. I moved back home for two reasons: it was cheap, and I could actually get my work done in a quiet environment. I told Sarah this and that their son can't come up all the time because I'm trying to study. I told Sarah last week that her son could come up on days that I'm not home (Tue/Wed/Thur), but on days I am home, I am trying to focus and prepare for job interviews. She said agreed “sure, whatever. just lock the door upstairs.” Fast forward to today and I see him upstairs making lots of noise. I told my dad I'm trying to study but can't with all this noise and asked that they play downstairs.

My nephew tells his mom to come upstairs to tell me to ""stop being mean."" Sarah gets upset and says ""this isn't right"" and ""my son wants to play with his grandparents."" Ok, fair, but literally 4 months ago when he couldn't open doors, you didn't open the door for him to play upstairs, so why is him playing with his grandparents so important to you now? She feels like it's her son's right to play whenever he wants. 

My biggest issue with this is that she is literally not upstairs playing with their own son. She doesn't even play with their son for most of the day. She's usually just in their room watching reality TV all-day. Sarah also doesn’t work. So all the responsibility of taking care of her son is on my dad and mom. I'm upset at the fact that we have to bear all the responsibility for her son. 

When I talk to my parents about this issue, they both say they feel bad Sarah doesn't play with her son--their only reason for playing with the kid. It's literally my siblings responsibility to take care and play with her son. The worst part is that she wants a second kid. She basically does nothing. Her SO works, cooks, and cleans, so I don't fault them. 

I feel like my sibling is not doing their only job--being a parent. 

AITA?",AITA for not letting sister’s son play upstairs 4 days of the week (but on the other 3 he can)?
291,AmItheAsshole,"Recently I've been chatting to a woman who always gets the same train home from work that I do. I'll call her Louise. She's really beautiful but there's a bit of an age gap. She's 31 I'm 23. On the plus side I look a lot older than I actually am, and so because of this I convinced her that I was the same age as her. 

I finally convinced Louise to give me her number and we chat for hours. We're going on a date later today but I'm not sure if I should continue lying about my age. 

The only reason I did is was that the last time I was talking to a woman, it was going well until the moment I revealed I was younger than her. At that point she said it wasn't right. A lot of women don't give younger guys a chance so this seems like the best way.

292,AmItheAsshole,"I'm 24, I've graduated university and once I settle down with job I'd like to move out. I have discussed this with my parents. Their reactions were abusive, and more or less made me feel guilty. My mother told me she would sell the house and move away. My dad is telling me he's sick, with 0 income. My mother makes the main income in the house hold and expects me to pick up my father's slack. I don't want to go because they won't be able to afford to live where they are, with the house and the cars. I would feel extremely bad. At the same time I'm feeling miserable and I lost the love of my life because of this shit. I'm really starting to resent my parents. But I feel like they've done everything for me and for me to just leave would make me an asshole. I've agreed to help them make payments by handing them money every month from my income. They still say the same old shit. ""I'm going to sell the house and leave!"". They expect me to stay there until I get married to someone they approve, which isn't going to happen.

293,AmItheAsshole,"Hey all, so I’ll get right to the point. In August, for my 25th birthday I had planned to go backpacking through Peru. I was going to do Machu Picchu, lima, Cusco, the touristy spots and some smaller villages. 

I just came up with this idea the other day while reading a travel magazine at my job and decided I should go for it. I texted my best friend who is currently in Mexico on vacation, stating that hey I think I might want to do this. She didn’t answer me until today, and I figured it was because of shotty reception, so I wasn’t worried about it. Tonight, she FaceTime called me and she’s like can I talk to you, and I’m like what’s up so we start talking and basically she laid into me saying that I stole her dream, she always wanted to go to Peru, I’m an awful person and she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. I honestly do not remember her and I ever talking about Peru prior to tonight. We talk a lot, we talk all the time so I honestly forgot. 

After going nowhere for a while, she tells me I’m an awful person, she’s done with me and all of my issues, and she’s not going to support me anymore. If I paid attention to anything she said, or if I ever really knew her, I would’ve known that was her dream. I let her know, I had forgotten, I apologize, and did you wanna come to? She said no, a lot more vitriol and that our friendship is over. Apparently she was sober while yelling at me, because I texted her boyfriend to confirm so, so I guess she’s just really pissed off that I decided to backpack alone in Peru.

So I guess I’m asking, did I take her dream? Am I an asshole? I didn’t feel like she could Bogart a whole country, it was just affordable, and the magazine made it look cool so I started making arrangements.

EDIT: Hey guys, I appreciate all of your input. It does make me feel a little better, but after some reflecting I think there’s probably a deeper issue at hand here. She stated that I don’t listen to her, because I did not remember this dream of hers, so I’m thinking this may be a build up of her feeling like I don’t listen, and could’ve been the straw that broke the camel. So I’ll try to talk to her with an open mind and acknowledge her feelings, and try to move forward from there.",AITA. I’m going to Peru and somehow stole my best friends dream?
294,AmItheAsshole,"So I go to a university with pretty massive lecture halls meaning the professor really can't hear if people sitting in the middle/back are talking. 

Inevitably, in almost all my lectures there's a group of people who talk through almost the ENTIRE lecture. Now I don't mind whispering or talking for a couple minutes. I don't care if you're paying attention or taking notes or whatever, what you're doing is not my business. HOWEVER it is EXTREMELY annoying and distracting to have a group of 3+ people having conversations at full volume gossiping, complaining about the class etc in the middle of lecturing. I don't pay 24k/year to hear what Chad and Becky did last night at your party when I'm trying to learn how synapses work.

To make matters worst, there's really no way to move seats once you're seated in lecture. Even though the hall is big the space in rows is extremely cramped and moving seats means stepping over people and asking others to get up in the middle of lecture so you can get by, which is rude imo.

295,AmItheAsshole,"For context: my aunt lives with me. Her, my best friend, and myself, would frequently hang out together and we were all best friends despite the age gap.

Friday, my best friend (18f), aunt (27f), and her boyfriend (31m) had a threesome while I (18f) was at work. When I came home, my aunt texted me saying to not come in, go downstairs, she’s busy, don’t knock, etc.. I expressed confusion and she responded “Trust me”. Of course I was weirded out and jokingly asked if there was “weird sex stuff” going on. No response. I keep making guesses and still, no response. At this point, I’m on the verge of having a panic attack b/c I have no idea what is going on. I tried distracting myself and told myself I was just anxious. Turns out it was my intuition firing off shots b/c I was right. 

On Monday, best friend and I were hanging out and my aunt comes downstairs. They drop the bomb and say that it’s been “eating them alive” for the past 3 days. Of course, I’m upset and explain that they crossed multiple boundaries and I don’t think I’d be comfortable with the 3 of us hanging out anymore. The best friend stayed quiet and my aunt said that it was 3 consenting adults and that they didn’t have to tell me b/c it’s not my business. They felt bad for lying, but even then excused that by saying they were scared of how I would react and didn’t want me to judge them. My aunt said she doesn’t want me to be upset with the best friend b/c she made a decision as a consenting adult to have a good time and she had fun. I tried explaining why it was wrong in multiple ways - one explanation was along the line of “you have 3 best friends, and 2 of them go off and do this thing together, completely disregarding the other best friend”. I meant that in the way of my feelings being completely ignored; my aunt’s responses was, “well, it’s not like there was a way you could’ve been involved because we’re related”. 

Since Monday, I’ve been ignoring both of them because the whole situation really disgusted me and showed their true colors. I feel like it’s wrong on so many levels, and I don’t think I can forgive them. Neither have shown remorse in doing it, only in the fact that they told me. I feel like I’ve lost both of my best friends/a family member. My aunt moved out today, and my ex best friend has been posting A LOT about moving to where my aunt is going. Prior to this situation, the 3 of them (aunt/bff/aunts bf) had a group chat about living together.

My ex best friend and aunt have made posts about doing what they want, and basically victimizing themselves.

296,AmItheAsshole,"""(ish)"" in the title is because no one in this is married. Referring to my sister in law as Liz, my boyfriend as Jack, and his brother (Liz's boyfriend) as Mark.

Jack and Mark used to live together. Mark moved out at the start of this month to live with Liz, at which point I moved in with Jack. Mark and Liz's new flat is a lot smaller. Mark owns a lot of gym equipment, plus several large musical instruments, all of which are in his old room at mine and Jack's place. He has arranged new storage, but it won't be available until the end of February. In the meantime, he is coming here to access these items. Mark needs the instruments for his job, but he no longer has a key, so when he needs to pick anything up from his old room he contacts me or Jack and we let him in.

Earlier today I was home, alone, and my phone died so I put it on charge. Mark needed something out of his room. He called Jack and Jack gave him the key to get in. I was in the shower at the time he arrived, and came out of the bathroom in a towel. Mark was very apologetic, and made a point of looking away. I was also apologetic for not answering my phone and I could barely look at him, either. It was all very British. I went to get dressed and Mark was gone by the time I came back into the living room.

About 4 hours later I got a call from Liz. She started off nice, just saying Mark was acting weird and asking if anything had happened, and I told her. She then said that Mark had already told her everything I'd just said but did anything else happen. I said no. She asked me twice more. She also asked what he came to get and I said I don't know, I was changing when he got it.

I got sick of this and directly asked Liz what she was implying. She responded that Mark waited a while to tell her and she didn't know where he was all day. I responded that I didn't know either because he wasn't with me.

Liz then said if Jack saw her in just a towel and then was radio silent for hours, I'd react the same way. I said ""I wouldn't, and I don't appreciate what you're implying"". She then went back to not knowing where Mark was, and I said ""why not just chip him?"" She then got offended and I said that the towel thing was unfortunate, but if Jack can laugh it off then she can, too, and there's no need to accuse me or Mark of something we didn't do. She then said again that I wouldn't want her around Jack in just a towel and I responded that I was secure in my relationship and it's not my problem if she isn't.

Liz is making this Mark's problem, so Mark is making this Jack's problem. I refuse to let it be my problem or apologise when she started it. Jack is on my side, and can't believe the cheek of her but Mark wants this to go away, which will only happen if I apologise and reassure her for the umpteenth time that nothing happened.

297,AmItheAsshole,"Sorry, on mobile. Here's some backstory: I am from a religion where funerals are very much a celebration of someone's life and a time to look forward to seeing them again after we have died. They are somber, but there is also a feeling of hopefulness through the event. The religious event I am referring to is when someone reaches a specific age or point in their life, they are welcomed into our religion. There isnt a huge party, usually a small luncheon with family, but it is a celebration. Both of these events are considered major events in someone's life, leading them to eternal happiness.

My brother in law will be joining our church next week, so my husband's parents are flying us out to see them all and to celebrate! He has a very tight knit family, moved around constantly, have friends in lots of places, but no super close friends, so they all rely on family more than anything. We were worried we wouldnt be able to afford the plane tickets to come see them, so his parents buying us the tickets was a huge relief. This will also be the first time we will see his family since we found out we ar pregnant, so his family is looking forward to seeing my specifically.

My great grandma passed away last night. I didn't know her very well, but I have a few memories of her and she was a very sweet and gentle person. My grandpa is very sad, and rightfully so. My dad is also fairly sad he has lost his grandma, but we have all been expecting it for some time. My heart hurts for my grandpa, and I want to be there for him as much as possible.

The problem is, both of these events take place on the same day, several states apart. I simply can't go to both. My husband would be devastated if I dont come with him to see his family, for the first time in so long, he feels a little homesick whenever he's away from them. My mom thinks I should go with my husband. But I cant help but feel so guilty for not being with my grandpa during this hard time for him. I'm thinking I will being my grandparents some dinner in a day or two and spend some time mourning my great grandma with them, or simply giving them something to keep their minds off of it, whatever would help, but go to see my in laws instead of coming to the funeral.

298,AmItheAsshole,"In most cases at a double drive-thru, I usually follow the rule that you alternate going forward regardless of who orders first. That's just the easiest thing to do, especially when a restaurant is busy.  However, the other day I was hit with a unique scenario and it's been bothering me ever since.  As I pull up to a double drive-thru to get a quick breakfast before work, a car was just pulling forward out of line 1 and line 2 was empty.  I pull into line 1 and place my order immediately, and then I wait...

After roughly 5 minutes, the line hadn't moved at all and there was one car in queue behind me. Meanwhile, line 2 was still sitting open and a truck pulls around the car behind me and places his order in line 2 and proceeds to pull forward and wait for his time to merge in line. I look in my mirror and see the frustration on the face of the guy behind me and I was feeling the same way. Now, this is the point where I would usually alternate and let the guy merge, but since I had ordered a full 5 minutes before he had even pulled into the parking lot, I felt like I had a rightful claim to pulling forward first. 

Fast forward another \~10 minutes and this is how it goes down. Line 2 guy lets the car in front of me pull forward because he was obviously there before line 2 guy and then when the line moves again, I used my advantageous positioning behind the last car to merge to claim my spot and not give line 2 guy room to slip in. Line 2 guy immediately throws his hands up in the air and looks pretty angry. He rolls his window down and is yelling and screaming that it was his turn while calling me every name in the book. I calmly told him that I had been there 5 minutes before him and rolled my window back up as to not engage with him any further and this just seemed to piss him off even more. He gets in one more ""fuck you"" and then glared at me for a few more minutes before I was able to pull forward again.

299,AmItheAsshole,"A little context first, I have lingering mental health issues and whilst I am better then I used to be. I still do have low points. I was having one of these low points the other night and felt like I. needed to a long term friend of mine for advice and some home truths. I messaged two people. One replied and helped. The other seen and ignored me.

I was miffed but I said nothing. A few days later that person did a tweet saying how with mental health you find out who truly cares for you and who your friends are. It was like a fire was lit up in my belly. Because I reached out to her and got nothing but she wants people to be there for her when she's low and reachs out?

I responded publicly which I will admit was probably my biggest mistake. Basically saying how hypocritical it was and where was she for me the other night with how I was feeling? She said the world don't end cause I don't reply. Which normally I would agree with but when someone needs help and support? To me at least a reply of sorry I'll reply later busy right now isn't too much to ask?

I say in retort how a good friend shouldn't make me feel like an inconvenience or nuisance and I end up blocking her. A few days go by and I do think that I am in the wrong for being public about it but at the same point I'm not wrong for anything else. So I message her friend who I also know well (big mistake in hindsight I know) about what I think about the whole thing.

She says she's got alot on right now and doesn't want to be involved which I say ok but then I'm invited to a Facebook group chat with people including my ""now ex friend"" I originally fell out with and others talking shit about me, hurling abuse and making threats about beating me up and people saying they'd second and third that.

302,AmItheAsshole,"Okay, I don't know how people from other cultures will judge the whole setup, but anyway here goes:

I got married fairly recently. My in-laws, husband and I live together. I have it 99% better than most women who live with their in-laws. I don't do household chores that my husband doesn't equally take part in, and that was our agreement before wedding. Both of us are working, and our in-laws are retired and staying home. They take care of the house, and also don't interfere much in our life. Except for rare occasions. 

Now, one of the major arguments in the early days of our marriage was that my in laws didn't like me wearing shorts. These were not like extremely tiny ones, but ones that were right above my knees (Yeah, women, especially married women do not dress up like that in our culture). My husband and I had a huge argument about it, and in the end, I agreed to not wear shorts if he stopped wearing them. I am also told to wear certain kind of dresses when we're visiting their relatives, or when their relatives come over, to maintain the family reputation. (Already I wear 3/4th sleeve dresses/t-shirts only because I have body image issues)

He agreed to dress modestly too, but every now and then he'd forget. Also, when the climate gets hot, he just removes his t-shirt and sits in the living room with just his vest on. 

I point out to him that if we were living alone, I'd be able to dress like that too, but because he WANTS to live with his parents, he should at least respect my feelings and dress modestly. 

Most of the times when I point it out, he gets angry and just snaps at me. He later apologizes and covers himself up. 

Today he was wearing a really old stupid t-shirt and shorts. I told him that the t-shirt looks really ragged, like the kind someone will wear while doing a painting job, and he should consider not wearing it while going outside the house. He got defensive and started saying that he will wear what he wants and that I should not make unwarranted comments. 

Well, seeing how his entire family moral policed me into wearing full length pants even in the summer, I told that I have the rights to say what I thought about his t-shirt. Also, I pointed out that he was wearing shorts and he should change it. 

He now gets angry and says that if I want to wear shorts, I can wear them. 

But I know that this will cause a major issue and might lead to my in-laws never talking to me again. Being a woman, I'll be blamed for everything that goes wrong, regardless of what conversation my husband and I had. I don't want to antagonise my in-laws, but I just want my husband to follow the same dress code that is expected of me.

303,AmItheAsshole," His co-worker and I study the same course so we can secure a permanent position in the same career field but in different sectors.

I am struggling like hell because I have to do these tasks in a language I am not, in my opinion, very good at. Concentration is also very difficult for me. I have a 3 years old who always wants everyone's attention. I have to also cook and clean. I work also. My partner works a lot and he rarely gets days off. Therefore, between preschool and evenings, I don't really have time to do any tasks, let alone concentrating on them.

His co-worker lives with his parents still. He works part time, doesn't have a kid or a wife. He has all the time in the world to do the tasks. Plus, he has friends from the job in the course that will carry and help him out. So, even if he doesn't show up to the course itself, his friends still vouch for him and help him out with the assignments.

This particular course is obligatory for me before I get to dive into more courses that fit more with my job whereas this course is easily understandable for the co-worker since he has been working in the field for a long time with different people. So, in a sense, he's already at the advantage of passing this course.

This course is taken in a second language for him, but it's a third language for me. His co-worker had already mastered the language since he moved here when he was 3 years old. I moved here 4 years ago, was a stay at home mother (involuntarily due to the immigrant influx situation) for 2; so, I got the chance to study the language for only 2 years: 1 year academically and another year from working with the natives.

I hope you can see why I am struggling here. And my partner cares about his co-worker passing the course more than me.

AITA for crying and getting mad at my partner who seems to care more about his co-worker than me?

Edit: My partner took this course and has been helping the coworker out by relayin the information regarding the assignments and the tests. I asked for his help with our kid but to just get told they wouldn't care if I hand in my assignments late. I do care. I want to be responsible for my own things. 

I told him it's difficult for me to study when I have to take care of our kid also and he just shrugged off, saying I'd be fine, whereas when he was taking the course, I'd help out every step of the way to make the learning process easier for him. I have ADHD and the difficulties concentrating and actually finishing a task. So, having a three year old around doesn't help, and they're always loud. 

Thank you to all for calling me an asshole for being petty about the situation. I do try my best and I know that. I got A on my first assignment but it was a complete wreckage. I have two tests coming up, assignments that aren't done, group works that no one help out, etc.

My boyfriend of 8 years and I recently got engaged. I bought his wedding ring in a store so he already has it, and mine is coming in the mail so I’m not wearing one yet. We’ve told a few close friends and the couple of family members I have that I talk to regularly, my sister and cousin. He hasn’t told his family yet because he knows they’ll want to see my ring, so we’re waiting for that. 

I haven’t had a good relationship with my parents for a year. Lots of fighting and not speaking. Things finally started to calm down, but the day I bought my boyfriend his ring my mom did something real shady and made me really upset. So I didn’t tell them when I was telling other people. 

WIBTA if I didn’t go to them to tell them about the engagement, and just let them find out with everyone else? I know in their eyes this will be a moment I took away from them forever, so I don’t know if I’m overreacting and ruining something or not.

Edit for context: I’ve never had a “normal” relationship with my family. Shitty childhood full of drugs, fighting, police, petty drama, family feuds, lots of stuff I’m realizing was really bad.

We offer a few ways to adjust the repayment period and thus monthly payment even after the loan is provided, and it's all pre-calculated in the system along with the relevant interest rates. So we can easily answer simple questions on that.

She had been making payments for about six months via automatic withdrawal. So she asked if she was paid up and if her monthly payments were sufficient. I confirmed she was. Then she asked for her interest rate and current amount of interest she accrued each month. I answered that.

She then paused and then said ""So I'm not paid up? Because I should pay *interest amount + minimum payment*?""

I told her no, the interest is built into the monthly payment. She can overpay to pay it off sooner but is not required to do so.

She paused again and asked me a few other payment options. I gave her the length, amount and interest rates. She paused again and said ""so on this plan I really should be paying *number*?"" It was an amount I never stated and I have no clue where she got it from. I simply gave her a flat no and reiterated the plans and monthly payment amounts.

She then asked how much she had to pay to pay it off in a certain time frame. I gave her the cited number for that timeframe's plan. After another pause she said ""so I have to pay *different amount*?"" I was stunned. I told her no, the number is simply what I quoted before and I reiterated it.

She then basically said ""Well you see *rattled off long list of information that had nothing to do with the payment plan or even the loan.*"" I simply reiterated that wasn't relevant and what her amount would be. She then mentioned her friend had a different loan from a different provider with a different interest rate. I simply responded ""OK"" and then reiterated our amounts.

After about ten minutes of going in circles reiterating this info my brain had turned to mush.  I no longer had any idea what she was talking about and could no longer follow. So I simply said ""Ma'am I'm sorry but you are greatly overthinking this. I've stated your potential term length and exact monthly payment amounts multiple times and those plans are all that is available. Do you wish to switch your payment plan to one of these or stay on your current plan?""

I personally have blonde and brown eyes from my dad. My mom has black hair and blue eyes from my grandfather. My uncle mentioned how their kids got their looks from my aunt and I sort of mentioned that I also have her eyes (in more of a joking way since I am pretty darn pale). My mom and dad got super upset with me about this and once most of the other family members left they told me that I’m their child and all that hoopla.

I'm gay and he's bisexual but like 90% of the time into boys. We relate to each other a lot, but sometimes I feel like his opinions are toxic. He's pretty traditional and doesn't believe in gay marriage because ""children should have a male and female role model in their parents"". Therefore, he says he wouldn't adopt a kid with his future partner. I don't like when he tells me that, not because of his personal wishes but because he knows I *would* like to have children when I'm older. So he thinks I'd damage my future kids just because I'm gay.

On the other hand, he's not a generally bad person and has given me a lot of advice and guidance. For example, just yesterday we had an interesting long conversation about how gay kids grow up faster because of the mental stuff we have to struggle with. And I completely relate to that, I feel more mature than my classmates sometimes.

I told my parents I would rather be called Uri, and for a while when they called me by my birthname I immediately corrected them (e.g. Hey *deadname* can you pass me the salt? - URI - yeah of course here you are)


My mum got very annoyed and would call me more and more by my deadname because she said that me insisting made her less likely to call me Uri. I haven't come out 'properly' and said ""Alright so the thing is that I am not a girl and don't feel comfortable with a girl name"" because 


A) When I came out as non-straight (I am pan, but my parents don't even like the bisexual label so I didn't want to start talking about genders and such because I knew it would make them angry) they told me it was just a phase, and my mum would manage to slide into conversation that people are either gay or straight and bisexuals are not real, yadda yadda yadda. They didn't react well when my sister came out as lesbian either.


B) As I said, they don't believe bisexual (much less pansexual) people exist... And they believe transexual peoole are just ""looking for attention"".

So the thing is... I do want to come out to them and tell them how I feel. However, they are very judgemental about gender/sexuality issues (I feel that if a friend of theirs came out as nb they would be ok with it, but they'd still think it's bullshit and they are not afraid to let me know how they feel).

I work security at a higher end retail center. A couple months back I had to stand by a work truck that was suctioning water out of a pit. Important thing to note is that this truck was loud. And I mean LOUD. Between the huge diesel engine, the suctioning equipment on it, and the hydraulics it was virtually impossible to hear anything. I could barely hear my radio and I had it on full volume and clipped onto my shoulder. Furthermore, this truck has to positioned to where the roadway is cut down to one lane, so I have to stand by and direct traffic. Admittedly, it wasn't too bad because it was Monday night.

So as I'm standing there, this lady pulls up with her window rolled down to ask me a question. I could see her lips move, but I couldn't hear what she was saying. There wasn't any traffic around, but since we're cut down to one lane and I can't hear shit and I was also yelled at by my boss for answering questions when someone was blocking the road (or as property management put, ""don't stand there and have a conversation with them""), I just tell her to keep driving. I saw her lips moving again and I tell repeat myself.

She pulls forward a bit and then stops again. I then start repeating 'keep driving"" and at specifically tell her ""I can't hear you"". I finally hear her ask what my name is and I tell her just to get her moving.

Three and a half months ago my step mother passed away unexpectedly of a stoke. Her and my father have been together since I was 8, so she was essentially my second mother and one of the kindest people I’ll ever know. 

Since she passed I’ve been doing my best to adjust, but sometimes it still doesn’t feel real, and it feels like if I call her she’ll answer and we can chat about everything that’s happened. My dad has been coping as okay as can be expected. He’s had relatives stay with him for the first few weeks and help with funeral arrangements, a lot of which I did to take the burden off him, but now it’s at the point where life has to try to go back to normal. 

This afternoon my dad told me that he’s started seeing someone. Part of me isn’t surprised, because he’s the kind of person that can’t be alone, and before my step mum there was always another woman. But mostly I’m hurt and angry that he could even think of moving on so soon. He wanted to know how I felt, and I got the impression that he expects me to be supportive of him and this new woman. I want more than anything for him to be happy, but it feels like a slap in the face to my step mother to do it so soon

324,AmItheAsshole,"Edited due to length.

I'm a high schooler currently and I'm living abroad So the situation that I'm living in is... there's a dad and a mom and two kids, tiny, suburban town where the richest kids live on a mountain, where it's safe to walk out at night and where transit can be halted by the weather in a blink of an eye.

To summarize, I'm just a messy, loud-yet-shy kid who is busy and can be late on her promises (a LOT).

However, I feel like I've still been mistreated. Sorry for the long exposition. ***Now, the meat of the post.***

To clarify- I don't feel this way by the mom, because she is an angel.

The dad, however, I feel like he completely loathes me but hides it under a smile? The mom told me that while he seems friendly, ""\[I\] should keep my distance because he is extremely particular about the way the house is,"" and I only half-understood to what extent.

(EDIT: I was asked, not unwarranted) ""Honestly I don't like the water that \[the fridge\] filter(s) at this house, it's sorta gross to be honest.” The man complains to his wife without telling me and she relays the information. Why can't he tell me there and then? Personality differences? Sure, I get it. I've done that before.

The second instance of this in action was the way I forgot to push my stool. He stopped me, told me I didn't push my stool- I push it in then. As soon as I leave, he starts getting into an argument with his wife about me (we're both from the same country, he thought I was whitewashed and couldn't speak its language) and starts complaining about my behavior. He goes on about how they should kick me out of the house, and the mom is defending me- ""Even if you really hate her this much, we should **at least** give her a year.""

Then we go to a restaurant for breakfast once, and I accidentally bump the tray, causing a loud noise. He makes fun of it. Then, four weeks later, we go again, and he brings it up. Okay, that's fine, funny, even. Again, he brings it up and I'm on the verge of tears (PMSing probably) I tell him to stop again in the car, as it had been going on. Quote- ""Please, stop. I'm serious. I don't like this very much anymore.""

And then he moves back into the family home a few months ago. And now, recently, I was putting my laundry downstairs when I was told by my homestay mother that I should put it there so that she could wash it for me after I left on Saturday morning. I do, and I carry it in two batches, because I need to wash my blanket too and I kinda leave my laundry piling, very irresponsibly... I know.

So the first batch has me opening the downstairs door and keeping the light on, I'm singing very loudly but when I go back upstairs to grab my 2nd batch, he calls out that I should close the door. I say I have laundry. He says ""you should close the door regardless.”

I explain that I'm only grabbing the 2nd batch and since I couldn't use any hands… (cont if there's any interest, again, I cut out 6000 characters from this post)I'm overreacting but, AITA?

326,AmItheAsshole,"Throw away, btw.

So, my family (me, mom, at the time 2 brothers) used to go on a family vacation every 2-3 years. The last time we went, I was 14, brother 1 was 9, and brother 2 was 7. We would always get one room with two queen beds, me and B1 would share a bed and mom and B2 would share a bed.

We haven’t gone on another vacation since then, and my Sister was born 3 years ago. This time, my mom said I should invite my girlfriend of 4 years, and I thought that would be fun so I did.

However, today I asked my mom if she was booking the rooms or if she’d like me to. She said she would, and made a comment on how she hoped my girlfriend wouldn’t mind sleeping in her own room. I told her I had planned on staying in a room with my GF, and my mom got really mad. She said she assumed it would be the same as every other family vacation. I told her that I didn’t see how that would work, as my B1 is now 14, I’m 19, B2 is 12 and my sister is 3. My mom said that I would share a bed with B1 still, and her, B1 and sister would share a bed. I told her no, I wasn’t sharing a bed with my grown brother, nor was I going to make my other brother share a bed with a 3 year old. I told her it makes more since if I share a bed with my girlfriend and B1 and B2 share a bed, and her and sister share a bed. She told me the whole vacation was off because I wouldn’t agree to her terms, and B2 said that even if we did go he didn’t want to sleep with her and sister.

I don’t feel like I’m saying anything crazy, I think she’s being a little unreasonable. Even if my GF wasn’t coming, I’d probably have booked a room for myself, or maybe another room with two beds one each for me and B1 since were both pretty big and it would be hard to share a bed with either of us.

So reddit, am I being the asshole?",AITA for getting a separate room for me and my girlfriend on a family vacation?
327,AmItheAsshole,"A little bit of a backstory, I’m 20, nearly 21 and I am living with my partner. Before that I was living at home with my mum, three sister and my brother. We’ve never been a well off family but we always got by and as far as I can remember there was always food on the table. 

A couple years back my mum was having some financial trouble and whilst I had a stable job, I couldn’t afford to give her much rent. She begged and pleaded with me to help her get some money to pay off the bills she had and get the kids some new school uniform (we’re British). I offered to lend her some money as a loan of sorts and it was agreed that she would pay me back by August 2019. For a whole year I didn’t say anything about the money and pretty much completely forgotten about it. It wasn’t until I moved in with my partner and he reminded me that I mentioned it to my mum.

In August I asked her about it, she said that she was struggling a little with money and needed till Christmas, I agreed because I was in a more financially stable place and didn’t exactly NEED it so it wasn’t a big deal to me. Cut to the beginning of December where I mentioned it again and she said it would be paid back by the 20th. Brilliant! I can get in a last few Christmas bits before putting the rest into my savings. 

The 20th rolls around quickly and nothing happens, I don’t mention it, it’s Christmas after all. It gets to the 22nd and it came up in conversation and she basically denied ever borrowing money. A long argument ensues, in which she claims I’m ruining Christmas, and she finally admits to borrowing it and agreed to pay it back by the 27th. As you can guess, it never happened. I’ve messaged her and seen her a few times over the past month and she’s said nothing, every time I try to bring it up she claims I’m bullying her and making her feel uncomfortable. 

I feel like I should just give in and let her keep it, but my partner and I are planning to start a family soon and honestly we could really use the money to help with that. 

Am I the asshole for asking for it back?","AITA. I lent my mother some money and asked for it back, after two years"
328,AmItheAsshole,"So, my friend and I made plans to hang out the day before she went home for the long weekend. I was pretty much waiting on her as I didn’t really have anything important to do and we had planned for a general time to meet literally somewhere around the corner (not far for either of us bc we live so close). But it kept getting pushed back, and she’d had a bad day so I didn’t push too hard and just did some laundry while I waited on her to do whatever she needed. What bothered me was that by like 7 pm she texts me telling me how much cookie dough she just ate and basically is texting me like she’s chilling at home. I thought maybe she’s still packing, so I didn’t push until about 8 because the coffee shop closes at 9. I ask if she wants to go finally since they’re closing soon and ... no response after her consistently texting me for a while. I finally just said, it’s fine, we can reschedule for when you get back! She immediately agrees, which kind of hurt but I just let it go.

Come this week, I knew she was back in town and I invited her out one night to go have fun since our plans fell through before and she had been wanting to go out together. No response all day. NEXT day with an excuse but again I was like it’s fine. Tonight she texts me “i miss u” and that kind of just set me off a little because she’s been bailing on me. It just hurts to say that like I haven’t been trying to make plans with her. So as nicely as possible I just said well I tried to make plans with you twice and I know you had your reasons the second time but yeah. She responds with ‘wow omg ok. i wasn’t blaming you i was just saying i miss you”. But my thing is instead of saying you miss me, maybe don’t just bail on me when I try to see you and then you won’t miss me?? Am I the asshole for calling her out a little?

329,AmItheAsshole,"I (M23) have been helped financially from my parents since I moved out at 18.  Call it an allowance, safety-net, privilege pay, whatever.  A sum of $500 a month, plus coverage on college fees, car payments and phone bills.  Needless to say, I’ve had it easy.  So easy financial stress seems like a monster in the closet rather than a legitimate threat.

Right, so I changed my instagram name a few months back to separate it from my new photography account.  My photo one is under my real name, my personal under something I find funny.

However, my parents DO NOT find my insta name funny in the slightest.  Idk what I can put for reference... I guess it’s like I got a butterfly tramp-stamp or something.

Now to clarify... the name is really stupid.  Like childish dumb.  Third-grade funny.  I don’t tell my dates about it until I know they’re cool.  But hey man, that’s my humor.  It’s a private account, not linked up with anything official.  Just a little page for me where I find the name funny.  I see nothing wrong with that, but please, Reddit, be the judge.  My instagram handle is @feathersupyourbutt and that’s about the dumbest thing on there.  The posts aren’t raunchy meme’s or... idk... joker incel posts.  Just what i’ve been up to.  Updates on life and what’s goin on in life.  Tame puppy stuff.  But my parents just won’t let it die.  I’ve blocked them on my personal account, but they’re more than welcome to continue following my photography account, as that still has some updates for my life too.

There could be a number of reasons why they’re doing this.  I hope this is just a joke reason, and the real reason is that my dad hasn’t been paid in 2 months.  Not that I wish that stress on them, I’d just rather get cut off if they need to tighten their wallets for themselves rather than them not approving of what I find funny at 23.  Still, I’m not sure and any time I’ve tried to talk about it my mom brushes it off.  She doesn’t want to talk about it, she just seems to want me to follow their orders and not ask questions.  If that’s the case, then it’s time I start learning how to better handle my finances.

They would have huge parties and pretty extravagant cakes, like honestly, they were the size of a baby elephant, without exaggeration. Her birthday was always a huge deal because it was truly a day of celebration for all of us. 

However, my dad very suddenly passed away on the day of her birthday 14 years ago and ever since then, we haven’t celebrated it.

333,AmItheAsshole,"let me preface this by saying i try my best to make this an internal issue. i do not lash out at him. in fact, i’m not sure he knew  it bothered me until today, other than by, perhaps, the facial expressions i make when he talks about it. 

anyway, my boyfriend and i met through work. before we were together or even started talking, really, he had a crush on another, much prettier girl there. he even bought her birthday presents. i didn’t think much of it, just figuring they were friends. i knew they hung out outside of work, and he had even given her alcohol.  

fast forward til after we’re together. i find out that not only did he used to like her, but he liked her up until a week or two before we got together. he stopped liking her when he found out she went on dates with a lot of guys at work (supposedly, but i doubt it), so he figured they would never be anything serious. that hurt me at first, because it made me feel like i was just an option. 

he was very respectful to me, though, and stopped talking with her. i’d occasionally see, out of the corner of my eye, her speaking with him. he’d turn away and/or just not respond at all and stare at her blankly. a bit excessive and rude, i will admit, but it secretly made me feel good. 

now that i do not work there, he sometimes comes home (we live together) and talks about conversations they have together, or about stuff he does to make her laugh. for instance, today, he told me about how she blew him in the face with an air hose and he pretended to make his hair flow in the wind. i snapped and said i’d prefer if she would stop flirting with him. 

it hurts. we have an extremely loving and strong relationship. i know he would never cheat. i am not expecting him to. i do not believe he is. i’m just jealous and i don’t like it, but i don’t want to tell/ask him to stop, because i do not want to be controlling. i don’t go around talking with my ex crushes. why does he have to?

334,AmItheAsshole,"Originally he was a friend of my ex-boyfriend. Over the last year, we got close. In the past, he’s had a reputation of having younger (highschool to freshmen in college) girls hang around him. He’s actively pursued some of them, but not while I was friends with him. 
Recently, he’s been increasingly chatting with this freshmen who’s a fresh 18yr old. My friend is about to be 22. While I know age gaps aren’t that big a deal, the fact that his last gf was a young girl, also barely 18 who he more or less admitted to idealizing and kept pursuing her even after she broke up with him because 1. She was in another state, and 2. She wanted to “work on herself”. I warned him when he told me, while I want him to be happy, it’s a bad idea to go after people who don’t even know themselves yet. 
I am 22 yrs old and have personally been that naive freshmen. The guy who used me was 3 years older than me. While, yes, I understand people develop at different rates, the fact that he has a pattern is starting to seem (unintentionally) predatory to me. My ex, who used to be a good friend of his, said they met some 15 and 16 yr olds when they were 20 at a concert, and he still hit on one of them even after knowing how old they were. He ended up going to some highschool dance with the girl later on. 
To top it off, this friend has, on multiple occasions, admitted to “not caring” what happens to himself or others. He doesn’t fear consequences. When I told him I can’t agree with him messing with the newest girl, his response was “That doesn’t bother me but doesn’t mean I’m not gonna do what I decide to do”

335,AmItheAsshole,"Upfront, I (27F) believe I was the asshole. My roommate (29NB) doesn't, and now I'm unsure. 

A few years ago, I moved in with a friend (28F). I didn't know it at the time, but I had OCD and severe ADHD that I was managing poorly. These paired with dislocating my knee and my grandmother dying, put me in a bad place. AKA, why I'm the AH.

There were 3 big fights.

Her dog ate all of my special-needs cat's medicine. I panicked, called a vet, and paid $50, so I could start first aid. The dog was fine. Those meds were not cheap, and I didn't have the money to replace them. I asked roomie to help, but she blamed me because I didn't put them away. I didn't think the dog could reach the table, but he had a habit of destroying things if not watched. Should have known better.

Second, during DnD at our apartment, I started a teasing another friend about a movie. I thought we were close enough to tease after some late-night drunk heart-to-hearts. I didn't realize I was making things uncomfortable, and when I was called a bitch, I took it as a joke.

A friend who wasn't playing DnD wanted to see that movie and offered to buy me a ticket. I told the group that they could kill my character and left. Everyone was pissed. Game night was their stress relief, and I was disrespectful by not taking it seriously. I apologized to everyone. I gave them space during DnD and even left our podcast as they decided it was better if I wasn't involved at all. 

Third happened during her month-long trip. I asked her to write down everything that needed to be paid. She did for a few bills, then told me about the phone bill. I forgot about it until she called. I got defensive about her not writing it down but paid. Another shock was the utility bill which was over $170. She hadn't paid for it in three months, even though I gave her the money. 

Paying it wiped out my food budget, and I ended up starving before she came back. Logic didn't work at that moment because hunger + emotional dysregulation + endo pain + death in the family= explosive anger. I blew up. I don't remember much of because of the pain, but I did get a mutual friend to mediate. She said my messiness triggered her anxiety. I promised to try harder to clean, and she paid me back.

After, friends cut me off because they couldn't be friends with someone who blew up like that. I did everything I could to apologize, but people kept saying I was two-faced. 

My current roommate is a mutual friend, and they tell me that she complains about me even now. 

I've acknowledged I was a cunt, and I'm finally getting treated for OCD and ADD.

That includes talking about how my clothes don’t fit, my unhealthy diet, and how little I exercise. 

That said, she’s been determined for 2 years now to get me to go on daily early morning walks with her at a local park. I have two major issues with that.

How did she end up adding him to our family plan? I lived abroad for a year, and I didn’t want to cancel my number, so I put it on *vacation mode* for $10/month and gave my mom full authority to do whatever she wanted if she needed to change the plan or whatever.

I’ve approached this to my mom and she claims she talked to him, but then it happened again once more and we were stuck without data for the remaining 3 weeks of the cycle.

So now that they broke up, I believe that he should start his own plan. I don’t want to risk being stuck with him not paying the bill or blowing through our data again for the next year because there’s another 12 months left on the contract. 

My mom yelled at me last night and is now not talking to me because she thinks that I’m heartless, and I just couldn’t get through to her. Her side of the argument was that he e-transferred her the money yesterday for his part of the bill, therefore he should stay on the plan.

340,AmItheAsshole,"This Christmas after dinner my family and I were all sitting around the table having coffee and desert and chit chatting and my sister and I were discussing my pregnancy (my 3rd) and I mentioned how I wanted to try breastfeeding this time . I didnt with my other 2 children and always regretted not trying. Anyways after I say that my mom obnoxiously laughs and says that no I wont , I will hate it and give up . She goes on to say how its gross and a bunch of other ridiculous statements.. so at this point I'm super annoyed and I said how rude that was and defended myself saying I will try it . She proceeds to hold her hand across the table and says wanna bet ? As in she wants to shake on it and bet that I will hate it and fail.. I said I thought it was immature how anti breastfeeding she was , and that her outlook on it prevented me from wanting to try with my other 2 children. She was super offended by that comment for w.e reason even though it's true. Anyways we wrapped up dinner and I was so mad at this point that I wanted to go back to my house with my little family. I helped with dishes and shortly after my husband and the kids and I went home . I knew things were a bit tense so the next morning I sent her a few texts like Merry Christmas and a few photos of the kids opening their gifts as a way to break the ice .. she one word answered me and posted some ridiculous meme to facebook about how ""the tongue is a small thing but what enormous damage it can do"" . I found the whole thing ridiculous, she was so rude literally laughed in my face and put me down when I didnt even ask her opinion and now shes mad at me for defending myself? .A week later I dropped my kids off with my dad while my husband and I went to shop for a van, and I again acted normal tried making convo with mom and she wouldnt even look at me .. being very dramatic about it and giving me one word answers even turned away as I went to hug her.Anyways after that I decided to give up as I am not apologizing for anything.. it's been a month now and we still haven't talked .

341,AmItheAsshole,"To start with I would like to excuse my English and the bad spelling.And sorry for the long post.

Background:

So me and two girls (*lets call them girl 1 and girl 2*) in my class use to do a lot of assignments together the last year and a half. So when it was time for our practice group exam we decided to do it together as well. Girl 1 and I had great discussions but we ended up doing most of the work. Girl 2 on the other hand did only show up 2/5 days and what she contributed was in no way coherent with what girl 1 and I did. So the oral practice exam WENT HORRIBLE!

The episode:

In December it was time for the real group exam and compered to the practice exam we were allowed to make groups with less that 3 people, so girl 1 and I decided to make a group together sense our work together in the practice exam seemed to work for both of us. BUT for some reason my teacher added girl 2 to our group. Girl 1 and I were a little unsure about our teachers dissension but decided to give the group dynamic a chance more.

So the week for writing the synopsis for the oral exam comes around and girl 2 don't show the first day . Not the second. the third day she didn't show up girl 1 and I decided that the group dynamic WHERE NOT WORKING and it was best to write to girl 2 and tell her.  After getting one of the other more empathetic girls in our class to look over the message to make sure it was not rude and it got the point across.

this is what we wrote her:

"" hey, we hope you are okay? (*her reason for not coming to school the last 3 days where car troubles but the bus stops right outside her house*) Darling\_Dane and I have been talking and we don't feel like the dynamic between us are working. So we where thinking of doing the synopsis separate  but you are more that welcome to ask for our help and advise. Hope we see you soon""

Girl 2 just answered ""okay"" and has not spoken to girl 1 and I for almost 2 month now and I feel really bad, even though she did great in her exam.

So I have to know

342,AmItheAsshole,"My partner and I have been together for 5 years now. We had kids (unplanned) soon after meeting, and now live together with two children, 4 and 2.

We have gone away for the weekend a couple of times since having kids, and both times the experience has been awful for me. Our parents are all pretty shit grandparents. My dad moved to the other side of the country, my mum has admitted she’s just not cut out to have them, his mum doesn’t like to have them either and his dad runs a business with very little free time. 

Last time his parents had our kids (the weekends we have gone away before) they admitted to struggling and we returned to our kids filthy, unwashed, barely fed and barely clothed. His mum said she didn’t enjoy the experience and it’s unfortunate we don’t get to go out by ourselves often, but I’m happy to stay home with them. (For clarification, I am a SAHM studying from home so it’s my normal anyway).

A group of our friends are planning a weekend away in a town 2 hours drive from where we live. I feel really uncomfortable and don’t want to go - it’s hard pushed we’d even find someone to have the boys (normally we try to divide up the care between the 3 grandparents over the weekend) and I’m worried about how they’ll be cared for in that time. My partner is really angry with me about this, he says I’m not fun or social and he doesn’t understand why I won’t go. He feels like we don’t have fun anymore and I can tell this is important to him feeling satisfied in our relationship, I feel caught between a rock and a hard place. AITA in this?

343,AmItheAsshole,"I (26F) was homeschooled from 6th to 10th. I struggled with anxiety, anxiety/panic attacks, bipolar disorder. The school told my mother I wasn’t welcomed back until I was medicated. My mom medicated me, but as a lot of people know, meds are trial and error. She eventually said fuck it, put me in therapy and taught me at home. It was all legit. She had to meet with the school board every quarter and show work. She didn’t push religious bullshit on me. All in all, it wasn’t the ideal experience, but we both managed. I got my good enough degree when I was 15 and started focusing on my mental health so I could attempt to contribute to society. 

I’m not embarrassed about being homeschooled, but I hate talking about it. There are a lot of negative connotations surrounding it, also a lot of stereotypes and things like that. The moment anyone finds out I was homeschooled, it becomes an hour long conversation and a shit ton of questions and I just hate dealing with it.

My mother, however, loves talking about how I was homeschooled. A lot of people told her she was making a mistake in homeschooling, that she was fucking me up, so I think she feels vindicated that I managed to become a competent adult with an okay job, a mortgage, a husband, a decent member of society. 

That’s all fine, but what she doesn’t understand is that people will wait for her to walk away to bombard me with their opinions and genuinely question my upbringing. “You seemed so normal” is something I’ve been told to my face. “How did you have friends?” I didn’t (and I didn’t have any from kindergarten to 6th grade, but nobody cares about that. I was a weird kid with bipolar disorder, not much to like). “You really missed out, here’s a list of things you missed out on”. Etc.  

Example: when my husband was just my bf, she blew up my spot by telling him I was homeschooled. It’s incredibly difficult for me to discuss this with people and I wanted to do it on my own terms in my own way. It caused some tension between him and I because I “lied” but when he was asking the same questions I’ve been asked a thousand times, I said this is why I “lied”. I tell people I went to the high school across the county and nobody questions it. She also came into the bank (where I work) one day to open an account and told my coworker all about homeschooling. My coworker was grilling me about it and how she “had no idea”. Well, duh?

I do not want my mom thinking I’m ashamed or embarrassed. I don’t want her thinking it was a waste of time or that I’m not totally thankful for what she did. I thoroughly believe I wouldn’t be alive if she didn’t make the sacrifices that she did for me. I didn’t get a typical teenage upbringing, but I’ve had a very nice adult life that I wouldn’t get to experience if it weren’t for her. I just don’t need or want the additional judgement.

So, would I be the asshole?",WIBTA if I asked my mom to stop talking about me being homeschooled?
344,AmItheAsshole,"My (24m) girlfriend (22) and I met 2 years ago in New Zealand (my country) when she was here on a uni trip. She's from England. We fell in love and have been long distance since with visits every 6 months. 

After many long discussions we finally decided that she should move to NZ. She arrived on Wednesday. On Thursday we were having tea with my grandparents who invited us to welcome her. After tea we stayed at the table and had a chat. It was maybe 7.30 so not late at all when she apparently got really tired. She asked me of we could go home since she wanted to sleep. I told her not yet because my grandmother had backed a cake and it would be rude to leave before she served it. About 10 minutes later she put her head on my shoulder and FELL ASLEEP!! I woke her up and told her that we could leave soon as my grandmother was just getting the cake ready. Then we ate the cake and my girlfriend half fell asleep again with her head against the wall this time. We left shortly after and I told her that it was rude to fall asleep and my grandparents were really looking forward to this night and had put a lot of effort into food and dessert. She started crying and said that she was still really jet lagged and maybe it was a mistake to move for me if I was going to be so mean.

346,AmItheAsshole,"So for some context, I was playing a popular online game with a group of friends which I'll call Group A. Group A ended up leaving early after 30 mins to watch football together, so I saw my close friend who I've been friends with for a decade currently online, I'll call him Friend B. I'd also like to mention me, Friend B and a person in Group A are gay (it'll make more sense later). So I joined Friend B's chatroom and we end up playing for a few hours. After those few hours have passed, Friend B's friend, 'Friend C' joins and Group A come back asking to play. 

Now, when I joined Friend B's chatroom, I made note my friends left and I implied I was waiting for them to come back, however, Friend B felt extremely betrayed that I left him to play with another group of friends for one last game with them. I told Friend B to come join Group A, but Friend B said Friend C feels uncomfortable around people being 'really gay'. So I end up playing a game with Group A without Friend B or C. Friend B then tells me how betrayed he feels and I argue that if he wanted to play he could have played with my friend group. He states that Friend C just really doesn't like strangers. Later on he tells me about it again and curses me out because I betrayed him and refuses to talk to me now. 

I ask my other friends what they think, and they do the same thing with my, leave a friend group to play with other friends. The past several days I'm starting to think, maybe other friend groups don't operate this way? Is it wrong I played the same game right in Friend B's face with another group?

347,AmItheAsshole,"( sorry for the formatting, i’m on mobile, and this is also my first post, so i’m kinda new to all of this) 

As you can tell from the title, my “friend” ( we’ll call her Amy) would talk about crap about everyone and everything. i’m aware that she’s toxic, but our group is really close, and i don’t want to break that. 

So, around 3ish months ago, i found out Amy was talking about our group and everything wrong with it. every person, and every problem she has with them. it’s the 6 of us, if that’s important. but anyways, she was saying some really harsh stuff. like: “ugh, she can’t get over him!” “ she’s just crying for the attention” “she can’t get a hold of reality. she just faking her depression” the last one was directed at me, but she’s *technically* not wrong, i’ve never been diagnosed, but i have cut and it got pretty bad. she said the same thing about another person who actually has depression, (not too bad, it just kinda hits her here and there) and i really don’t think that’s ok. 

a few weeks ago: i decided to hang out with some other friends instead of the group, just to catch up, nothing bad. Amy go PISSED. here’s what i got: “ugh what the hell?! i can’t believe her.” plus more that i can’t remember. I soon had a small feeling they were gonna drop me ( get “rid” of me) and so i told another friend in the group. we’ll call her Coco. Coco told Amy, and then she said: “she’s being a bitch. like, she’s just asking for it. it’s her own fault. she being really rude” and stuff like that. Coco told me, and now, anything i tell Coco, she tells the group. ANYTHING. so i don’t answer any of her questions. Coco knows i have trust issues, but now, i just don’t know what to believe.

So she’s (amy) not talking to me, which is fine, i don’t really care. but i can’t tell anyone, and the group are all still friends, so there’s that. this whole thing is just really bad. we’re in 8th grade too, if that means anything. my parents are just saying “oh, it’s just small drama, you’ll laugh about it in the future” but right now, it’s pretty relevant to me. so i’m stuck. was i actually being rude, or am i just causing everyone trouble.

In other words: am i causing unnecessary drama, or is this somewhat important?

(i’m really sorry if this doesn’t make sense or anything!! like i said, i’m new and don’t really know my way around reddit yet! if i can, ill try to respond or something, and maybe make edits for clarification, details, etc.)

Edit 1: so when i say “snapped” i mean, i’m distancing myself from them. they’re all pretty clueless about my side, but i’m pretty sure they know amy’s side, or at least some of it. it’s not like i’m trying to make them mad, but apparently, it annoys them.","AITA?

348,AmItheAsshole,"Very recently I broke up with my then girlfriend. We lived together, signed the lease together, and split the rent 50/50. To break the lease we have to give 60 days notice then 1 months rent as we move out. So essentially the equivalent of 3 months rent but you get to stay for 2/3 months. She moved to the city I grew up in to be with me, when we broke up she got some of her stuff and is now with her parents in another nearby city. So I currently live in the apartment alone. It is important to note that she did not want to break up. Our relationship was toxic and I couldn’t do it any longer. I’m 23 and cant afford to lose more of my life on trying to make something work. Yesterday, I asked for her half of the rent and she got mad. She got incredibly angry and felt disrespected, stating that it was my decision to break-up and that makes it my responsibility to pay 100% of the rent. I can’t afford 100% of the rent. I told her at most I just need her to pay the equivalent to break the lease. As mentioned earlier we are both legally obligated to pay rent. I’m trying to find a roommate and change floor plans so I don’t have to break it. If I find one soon enough, I won’t ask her to pay all of that amount. I understand the fact I am living there and she isn’t so some would say I should pay it by myself but i told her she is more than welcome to live in the apartment and i move into my parents. My parents live 15 minutes away, not ideal but no biggie. I just don’t want to pay 100%, whatever i have to do to not do that, i will, accept get back together.  So am I the asshole for asking her for the money? 

TLDR: broke up with my girlfriend and asked her to still pay half the equivalent to break the lease. We both signed the lease. She doesn’t live in the apartment anymore but I gave her the option to live there and for me to move out.

Edit: I gave her the option to live in the apartment and for me to move out. She has yet to choose that option. I am just concerned about 50% of the amount to break the lease.

349,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway since this is slightly embarrassing. 

I (23F) was having a conversation with my partner (25M). The topic of porn stars came up. We were talking and eventually it got to me saying that I wouldn’t be okay with him being a porn star, and him saying that if I wanted to be a porn star, he would support me in my career choice. Apparently he doesn’t want to hold me back if that’s the career I’m passionate about. Neither of us want to be porn stars; it’s all hypothetical. It also got me back to thinking about how I would be quite uncomfortable with a threesome, and while he doesn’t want one, he is much more open to the idea of it than I am. 

Anyway, this started a tiny argument, as I’d kind of hope that my partner would be against me having sex with other people. Nothing big, but it has bothered me a bit, and I know that the argument kind of annoyed him.

350,AmItheAsshole,"Update: Thanks for all the input. I wanted to make sure there wasn't some aspect of this I just was not seeing because people are different. (I am definitely different than SIL2.) Sis1 and I discussed, and she volunteered to talk to SIL2 (they know each other better because they live close to each other, and I am many states away). Turns out all she had to do was directly ask SIL2 about her thoughts on the matter, and SIL2 mostly talked herself out of it (although once she did, Sis1 made sure to be clear that, yeah, we don't want babies on the trip). We're pretty sure no feelings were hurt nor relationships damaged.

BTW, those who are concerned we let this drag out too long, SIL2 announced her intention to come with baby in tow last night after my kids were already in bed, and Sis1 talked to her about it today. Sorry if I made it sound like it was dragged out. If we had thought she was on the verge of clicking the ""Purchase Tickets"" button, we would've done it sooner. We only delayed briefly so that we could deliberate about whether a confrontation was likely to damage our relationship with SIL2 because that is the more important thing.  

---

Update 2: A bunch of you are concerned about the breastfeeding aspect of this. SIL2 never said she was planning to bring the baby because of breastfeeding. I included the bit about her nursing her other children to say we had reason to believe that wasn't the issue. (After talking to her, we know that it was not the issue.)

---

My sister (Sis1) and I didn’t finish our undergrad degrees on our first go for various reasons. We both went back to school once our kids were all in school, and we are both graduating this spring. We decided to go on a girls’ trip to Europe for a week to celebrate, and we opened the invitation to come to the other adult women in our family, these being our two other sisters—one will complete her master’s degree this summer (Sis2) and the other has a terminal illness for which an amazing new drug has recently become available (Sis3)—and our two SILs—one of whom (SIL1) received her ASL certification in the fall. This is to say that many of us had reasons to celebrate, and we didn’t want to leave anyone out.

The first to respond was SIL2 who said that she and my brother already had a trip planned this summer for their anniversary, so she was out. Then one by one everyone else said they were coming. SIL2, understandably, felt left out. She texted after a few days that she was working on figuring out how she could join us. Most notably, she said she would be bringing her daughter who will be 8 months old at the time of the trip. She didn’t ask if we were okay with that; she just told.

She is currently breastfeeding said daughter, but she stopped breastfeeding her two previous kids by the time they were 8 months old. Having a baby on the trip would affect so many aspects of it from choosing our lodging to where we can go and for how long (e.g. we wouldn’t want to send her back to the hotel alone when it’s baby bedtime). Then there’s all the other unpleasant parts of having a baby in tow like strollers and feeding and crying while you’re trying to sleep.

We’ve most of us just finished a stressful lot of hard work taking care of our own kids while being full-time students and want this trip to be a relaxing time of relief from those stresses. The invitation (in the form of a group text) said, “Any of the adult women are invited.” Sis3 replied to SIL2 in the group text about the baby, “She's a little young to qualify as an adult, though...” But neither of those things has given SIL2 any pause. All but one of us have our own kids that we are making arrangements for so we can go. Although, in fairness, SIL2 is the only one who currently has a baby. Sis1 side-texted me when this was going down saying that she also does not want a baby along.

351,AmItheAsshole,"I (28f) am in a bit of a dilemma here and I'm hoping you guys can set me straight.

I have been dating my boyfriend (29m) since September last year and he recently moved to England from Ireland in order to start fresh with me. He is currently staying with some friends of ours. He just got a new job. 

I live with my Mum, around 4 hours drive from where he is currently staying and working. My Dad died in February of last year and it's taken a huge toll on us but especially my Mum, they were high school sweethearts together since 18, my Dad was 56 when he passed.

My boyfriend wants me to move up to where he lives and find a place together seeing as he can't come down to me anymore because of his job. I am currently not working and travel to him is extremely expensive as I do not drive. He can't afford a place alone and feels awkward the longer he stays in his friends house. I am excited about the idea but every time I think about leaving my mum here alone it just turns to pure guilt.

Would that be an asshole thing to do to her? Should I wait longer until I leave? I'm so torn it's literally keeping me up at night. (It's 4.51am as I post this).

I am finding it increasingly awkward to visit home. At each parents house when I visit, their houses are filled with new step family that I don’t know. It seems a waste of my time to get to know them, largely because I assume they will divorce again.

My dad especially seems to be struggling in his newest marriage, and his new wife even told me she will probably divorce him. My mom’s marriage seems fine, but she treats her newest set of step children as if they are exactly equivalent to her real children of 30+ years - for example she insisted that if I bought something for my (real) niece and nephew, I needed to buy something for all the kids of my step siblings (6 children) of equal value. I barely know these people. She also insisted I invite my step siblings to my wedding. Both parents always put a lot of energy into making their newest family members comfortable and happy, while I feel overlooked and disconnected and on the outside looking in.

353,AmItheAsshole,"Okay so a little history. I (16m) have a brother (16m). Now he gets stressed a little bit during exams and tests.. especially when he hasn't studied. He is consulting a specialist for this problem as well. 
Now we both have regular tests and our finals are in around a month or two. We both however have different study material. 
My brother had a test on Wednesday. However he spent the whole Tuesday doing nothing but passing time. He studied almost nothing the whole day. By the end of the day, of his syllabus of 7 chapters, he had finished only 3. So he got stressed and started panicking. Because our parents saw that, they decided to destress him they should let him play the playstation. Now we play a particular game in chances. He plays 3 days consecutively and I play 3 days consecutively. We play only 1 hour each day to see who gets further. Today it was my chance after 3 days but he got it. I didn't say anything because i knew that if i did, I'd be an asshole for doing so because he was stressed at that time and so saying it loudly didn't make any sense. So i go over to my mother while my brother was playing and tell her ""I dont think stressing because he didn't study all day should get him this reward"" and she said its true but just for this one time. I mentioned nothing about the chance and it was forgotten. 
Now, we have a common friend circle. My brother usually scores good marks on his tests but because he didn't study this time he got very low marks. So when the group was discussing their results and asked my brother why he scored so low, he was trying to make up some excuse but i said that its because ""he didnt study all day and he was stressing in the night"". They didn't think much of it. 
Later he told me that i shouldn't have told them about the anxiety part..i said i didn't i just said you were stressed in a casual manner and they didnt even think much of it. However he refuses and says I'm an asshole. So we decided to post it here and see for ourselves who's correct

My partner and I are both in university, so when he showed concern, I went to the University Health Service (missing a class that only meets once a week but has a relatively understanding absence policy). The doctor was not that helpful, which isn't surprising given the reputation of the place. She said it could be a concussion (I hit my head 20 days ago but not since then), a side effect from one of my medicines, or anxiety (which, like, maybe? I have diagnosed anxiety but it is under pretty good control and doesn't usually present like this). She took blood and sent it to labs.

Anyway, the doctor sent me home with instructions to follow the concussion protocol. This was all at 1030am. I had class from 230-5 and then worked from 6-9. Somewhere around 630, the doctor sent me a note that I am very low on vitamin d and she wrote me a prescription for it.

My partner was really worried about me, though, and he's usually pretty good at telling when something is off, so I called my dad and he agreed that I should go to the er. Up until this point, I was pretty reluctant because I probably wasn't like, bleeding into my brain. The vitamin d deficiency explained some of my symptoms, I was content to fill the script and wait it out.

But my boyfriend and dad really freaked me out and I got really anxious. So at about 10pm, I end up at the ER with my boyfriend. We wait there for 4 hours before we find out I probably won't get a bed until 7am, so I go home (short walk) and come back in the morning.

At 8am, I wake up and I'm sorta pissed. This is all stupid, I'm probably fine, etc. But at this point, I've scared my whole family so I sorta have to go back. I feel like shit because up until this point I haven't actually had to use insurance and now I do all because of some bullshit.

I go to the ER alone because my boyfriend isn't up yet. I get seen pretty quickly. The doctors say it's probably either a really severe migraine or a side effect from my medicine. They give me painkillers and fluids and I finally get home at around 3pm.

That was a long story to ask this: AITA for being irked that I got pressured into going to the ER when I was pretty sure I was okay, costing my parents a ton of money, spending a whole day in the ER alone, and had to deal with getting stabbed with needles for the IV (I fucking. hate. needles.)?

357,AmItheAsshole,"So, my son lost a school library book a while back. I got an invoice for $15.80 to replace the book. I went in the front office this morning to pay the fee with my card. The lady at the desk got really snotty with me when I told her all I had was my debit card, and she told me they ""don't take *cards*."" She then went on to explain the other forms of payment to me, like I was a 1st grader. Oh! And if you pay cash, they ""are not allowed to give change back"". She wouldn't even give me the damn paper that had the fine info on it. I was kinda pissed at the way she spoke to me, I am a 31 year old woman - not a child. I left, and she yelled behind me, ""Have a *great* day!"". I work in customer service, I know that really meant ""Go fuck yourself."" 

So, would I be TA if I went back in there and paid paid with literal change? Like, $15.80 in pennies, nickles, and dimes? Thanks!

I started talking to this guy maybe a week ago. We matched on a dating site and he seemed interesting. I got his snapchat because it's the only app that I use religiously. At first it freaked me out talking to him because he would use baby names like ""sweetheart"", ""love"", ""baby girl"", and such, but I decided keep talking to him, anyways, despite me hating people calling me those when I don't know them.
I'm very accepting of my body and love every roll and curve of it. Friends tease me that I'm conceited, but self love never hurts anyone! Nor do I put others down on how they look, either.
Anyways, I sent him a selfie today and here sent one back. I told him that he was attractive and asked ""I really don't mean this in a bad way, because I dont think there's nothing wrong with it, but are you a big guy? I'm a big girl"" 

Him: Yes. That's why I'm going to the gym.
Me: Damn. If you were close (he lives about an hour away) , I'd join you at the gym. I need to go, too.
Him: I low key took offense to what you said it should never have been a topic if I'm big or not
Me: I apologize about that. It doesn't change the fact that I still want to get to know you. I'm a big girl myself.
Him: I gotta get back to work...
Me: Have a good day. I'm sorry for asking.
Him: If your actually interested in a person you shouldn't bring up there weight I was teased all my fucking life about it. All I ever shown you was respect I saw you were a big girl and I fucking loved it because 1. I don't fucking  judge and 2. I'm into bigger girls. That's why you could have been as fat as a fucking bus but I wouldn't say a damn word because I have respect.
Me: No, I get it... I'm sorry...I guess because I'm very accepting and loving of my body that sometimes I forget that it can be sensitive even when people do ask if one is big or make comments of their size. So I truly do apologize.
Him: :(
Me: Well, hopefully you'll still want to talk.
Him: Hopefully I'm not to fat to text huh? It's fine if you wana go I don't care anymore. I don't have time for negative comments about me.
Me: Um, wow. Okay. I just told you that I still want to get to know you. And I wasn't making a negative comment towards you at all. And I said there's nothing wrong with it. 
Him: K. I highly doubt you're still interested.

360,AmItheAsshole,"First time poster and on mobile, so forgive me. Also, bear with me this is kinda long.

I (22F) have been going to the same hairdresser since I was 12. There has been some ups and downs, but I generally had her trained to only cut my hair about an inch or two everytime and avoid layering. We did some fun things with colour, and I generally never had an issue.

However, the last two times I went she messed up the colour to the point I had to fix it myself and cut bangs which I hate. For context the colour disaster was my hair got died red instead of a cotton candy pink.

So cut to today. I request light blonde hair and 2 inches off the bottom. I ended up with blonde hair with copper streaks and she cut off SIX inches of hair and gave me bangs. I have been growing my hair out since I was 13 and it took me that long to grow my hair about 8 inches after trims. My hair, no exaggeration, looks like I let a toddler cut my hair. It is so choppy and uneven. 

My hairdresser is a family friend so after the cut I tried to compose myself and I told it it was far too short and I didn't like the copper. Her response was along the lines of, ""Well I like the colour and sorry but the cut need to be done there was dAmAgE."" Other than occasionally bleaching or colouring my hair I do no other damage. I don't use heat on my hair or anything. My split ends were two inches long, not six. So, I paid, left and cried in my car to avoid making a scene in front of everyone at the salon.

So now I paid $160 CAD for her botch job. $330 CAD for extensions and toner to attempt to fix it myself. And tomorrow I will be spending $155 CAD to have someone else get the colour I originally wanted and fix this mess of a cut. That's a total of $645 CAD.

I know this all may sound vain, but I have been growing my hair for nine years and I am honestly quite devastated.

So WIBTA if I request at least a partial refund from my hair dresser for this mess?

Edit: The photo, as requested. For context I did tone out the copper and my mom mom attempted to fix the cut a bit. My hand is how long my hair was precut.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months now. I know that he uses drugs. I don't really have a problem with it but I don't really like it when he uses drugs. He says that he only does drugs in the weekends. Lately he has been using drug almost every day. In the past 3 weeks I haven't seen him sober at all.

Here's when things went wrong. He was at my apartment to chill and be together. He wanted to do some drugs (I dont do drugs btw) but I said not tonight, I don't want it, stay sober this he evening etc. He listened and didn't do it. I was happy about that and didn't think of it anymore.

I had to collect my clean clothes from the dryer and was away for maybe 8 minutes. When I came back he looked and behaved different than before.
I thought immediately that he used some drugs and confronted him. I asked him and he said he did. I asked him why and he said that I just wants to have fun and said that I said to him that he could (never did). I said ""i never said you could and am I not fun enough for you that you have to use drugs?"" He said ""no but I want to have fun while I'm young"". Was really disappointed and a little bit mad at him. I said to him that I haven't seen in sober in the past 3 weeks and ask him why. He can't answer my question. So on and on. I said to him that he needs to focus on school and work, not doing drugs. 

He is trying to get help but it takes long. I know that it does take long but in the meantime he can try to get better by himself. After making all my points he said that I was overreacting, being unreasonable but also that I'm right that I'm right. I said to him that he has 4 weeks to make visible improvement and to sober up. It's not a long time but I want to see improvement. I'm starting to question myself if I've overreacted and been to hard on him.

She said I was being unfair to the dog as she probably missed her previous owner, but I feel like I’m the only one that has been fair to the dog since they got it.

They go “it wasn’t broken before, I used it about a month ago” yes. It was. Because when I used it before that, it was gone.

You'll find the short version below.

Background: We work in a circus, in the middle of a shopping center. If we don't make circus shows, we work as a free playground, where the parents can drop their kids in and go shopping peacefully.

We've got a lot to do during the day, practicing, face painting for kids, managing the entrance/exit (Kids are allowed to come in the presence of his parents, and leave with them), birthday parties, etc.

It's a job, where you have to work in a team, if you want to be efficient, but then comes my coworker, let's call her Susan.

Susan is 25 years old, and for sure has some self-esteem problems, which was clear since i started to work here, she was the opposite of confident, and extremely shy.

3 weeks ago we realized that somehow she got a lot of confiedence, something changed her drastically. Things went just fine, until one day we was working just the two of us. I was painting some kids face, while she supposed to be registrating and quitting the kids. A kid came to me, that she wants to go to her mama, and I said ""Ask from the lady at the exit"" - ""But theres no one there""- she said. I stood up, and went there, let the kid out with her parents and then i looked for Susan. I've found her in the back of the circus, trying to juggle. I told her that I find it cool that she wants to do that, but right now I need her to be at the entrance/exit. She started to be passive agressive, but went back and did her job.

Some days later there was more of us, we closed for the day, and everyone had something to clean up. I asked her if she could go trough the stage with a vacuum cleaner, and she said no. I asked what else you've got to do, and then she said nothing, but she is too tired. I told her with some angriness in my voice, that I dont care how tired she is, all of us are tired, and all of us wants to go home, so get a vacuum cleaner and go trough the stage. She did her job again.

I don't want to write down every situation we've got, but things like this did happened since then, but let's jump into today.

After we arrived, everyone's got busy, including me with a new project i have to plan, so I told Susan exactly this: ""Susan, if you dont have anything to do, go to the entrance"".

She then had a breakdown, ""how dare you to just command me, do this, do that, clean this, clean that, you are 5 years younger than me how dare you to tell me what to do"".

Then she was working all day not talking to anyone, my coworkers were also concerned, but they know her, and not mad at me at all, but Susan wants to take this to my boss.

Every Chinese new year, my dad would make a phone call to his mother who lives in another country. Since we live in different countries and I rarely visit her, I'm not close to her at all. I might even say I don't even feel a connection. Furthermore, she's not fluent in English and she prefers to speak Hokkien, a Chinese dialect. 

So every year, when he makes the call, I'm ""forced"" to talk to her and engage in unecessary small talk in a language that I am terribly uncomfortable speaking in. I don't see her that often so I don't even feel a connection and I'm not even comfortable talking to her due to the language barrier. I don't see a point in the unnecessary annual small talk.

369,AmItheAsshole,"Hey, reddit. I'm on mobile so sorry for format, and I'll start by saying this happened a little bit ago, but a recent talk I had with a friend brought it up again and there was some debate. So, without further ado:

I had this roommate, we'll call her Brooke. I moved in with her out of college knowing her fairly(?) well, she was about 5 years older than me, and had 2 cats.

One of the cats was very loveable, the other wasn't a people cat, oh well. I cuddled the loveable one all the time when she was out. As time went on though, Brooke faced some financial difficulty. She couldn't pay her rent on time (I would pay both of our rents and she'd give me cash a few days after it was due, I had no problem doing this), but this included buying cat food and cat litter. It got bad.


If she didn't have enough cat litter to change the box, she'd leave it full of feces and urine to the point that there were no clean spots for the cats to use (they resorted to her blanket). It smelled disgusting. I would end up buying cat litter just to save my nose, and cleaning it myself. 
One afternoon, I noticed they were out of cat food. Brooke told me they'd run out and she'd buy more when she had money. She told me the loveable cat needed a specific expensive food because of a minor allergy- his hair might fall out.

The cats started whining, drinking so much, crying, unusually loud and clearly upset. My roommate was drunk two nights in a row, coming home very late, and I  told her, after a good 36 hours without them eating, that she needed to pick up food. Seriously, they split a single can of cat food and then went a full day + with nothing. She said she'd handle it, and that they'd be fine. 

I got home 10pm that night from a painting party. The cats were screaming worse than ever. Still no food. I couldn't take it anymore. I called Brooke- no answer. I waited until midnight. Nothing. Finally, I went downstairs to our neighbors ( I could hear they were awake) who owned cats as well, and I asked if I could please borrow a little bit of cat food. They said of course, and I filled up their bowl.

Brooke was *furious* with me. When she answered me at 2am, she called me a bitch and told me that one of her cats could now lose their hair because of me. I found that preferable to starving.
This was sort of the nail in the coffin on our friendship at that time, and now a mutual friend told me Brooke got a new puppy. I just feel weird about her with pets- she even left for a four day weekend once and left the cats with one bowl of food and water. I was supposed to be away those same four days (we were working the same event and she knew this, knew I'd be away), but had to come home the first day to get some things when I saw. I told her it concerned me then, too, but again, I was overreacting, and our mutual friends said similar.

So I’ve been suffering from mild/moderate depression since the beginning of summer and because of that, my grades have dropped a little. I still belong to the best students in my class but you can see the difference. 
My mom has always been a very nagging person but it’s gotten worse when my grades took a hit. Whenever I had a somewhat nice day she just has to destroy it with a fight about something stupid like a schoolbook in the floor. 
And last week’s argument was the final straw for me. Again, my mom started a fight over something stupid aaaand it escalated quickly. It ended with her telling me that it would’ve been better if I died instead of ""Sarah"" (Her friend's daughter) I was shocked and just went into my room silently. I cried because I didn’t think my mom would say something like that and I also didn’t know that ""Sarah"" had died. She’d been in a coma for almost 8 months after being hit by a car. I can tell you that she was an extremely kind and amazing person and a friend of mine. Meeting her was difficult because her family lives on the opposite side of the world.

I struggle with MDD and BPD. My holiday season was peppered (pun intended) with verbal abuse and general family bs that made me feel very stupid.

My older brother, the golden boy and only one with children, then added, ""looks great!"" and posted a pic of my niece passed out on a similar style chair at their house 2 hours away, with the caption 'they should go well together' meaning my niece (4) and my parents' reupholstered furniture.

I don't really like having sleepovers unless they're at my house, but I knew her for ten years and didn't want to up set her so I went.  I knew most her friends from when we would hang out so I just kept on thinking everything would be fine

374,AmItheAsshole,"So, I am in the same class as my bf and my friend, just gonna call him Max.

My bf and Max sit next to each other in one particular class where we all are supposed and required to ask around and help each other because it's hard.
Tensions are always high there because we all try to help but time is always really tight.

I do NOT sit next to them, but one row ahead so I can't really hear everything they say and also everyone's busy.
This one time I could hear my bf take Maxs' stuff and then he, for revenge, turned the PC off which my bf was just about to log into.
I know my bf and another friend always take worksheets and etc that Max worked trough or even half trough (he's academically doing a littlebetter) to copy it, when not even asking for permission or later thanking him
That day as we drove home my bf was being really annoyed so I asked whats wrong and he proceeded to rant about Max not helping him on a couple of stuff in that class etc. and how thats unfair because he always would try to help too. He did this for about 15-20minutes. 

I felt really uncomfortable 
1. Because I do not want someone to go off an a person in front of me because it feels bad to even listen w/o stopping it
2. I did not think that was a big deal, we are all stressed and obviously we dont have the time to help everyone on everything

We even had a fight about it. 
I talked to Max after my bfs' rant and he told me that he was annoyed at them because they always took his stuff and he couldn't even finish that. And I KNOW they do that.
So I just tried to put it clear for my boyfriend what was the reason behind him not always helping and that I felt like its not fair to talk about him in that way. 
I just try to defend my friends.
He got really upset and I still didn't really get the deal.
Today something similar seemed to have happend in class, I didn't know. When I came around to them my bf made a snarky comment about it and Max then asked how he could help but my bf refused to let him help.
My bf started telling me about the other stuff later and was really annoyed. I did not even really say anything against it because of last time, I asked him if he could not tie me into this because I don't want to be inbetween fronts, I respect both of them and I do not want to hear any of them talk trash about the other person.
My bf then proceeded to tell me that I am always on my friends side and not his and that I don't listen to or validate what he is saying. He also said I only defend Max and am always automatically on his side. I told him I would defend HIM too but Max did not trash talk my bf so I told him that.
We argued about it and I don't know if I did the wrong thing by defending Max when I am not in my bfs' position. I don't know what exactly happend between by seeing it happen, only from the rant.

375,AmItheAsshole,"So I’ve (22F)  lived with, let’s call her Abby (22F), for about 2 and a half years now (we are at uni together) as well as living with my best friend and some other girls/guys in our friendship group. Now in first year my best friend (Polly) didn’t overly get on with Abby due to just difference in personalities. However during second year we all became closer. 

For some context Abby is never on time, we say 9 and she’s ready at 10, We text her and won’t hear back for 1-2 weeks despite her being glued to her phone. She left another friend in Manchester for an hour after they agreed to meet (just the 2 of them)

Now for the last few months since 3rd year started (September) we haven’t seen her I would say in total I’ve seen her for about two and a half weeks. This is since about July if you include summer holidays. 

Now polly’s birthday is coming up in a week and we’ve spoken about going for a meal, I questioned whether Abby would be invited? We weren’t even sure if she would be here. Polly said that as she hasn’t seen Abby nor does Abby ever text or ask about polly, she said if she’s back yes but she isn’t overly keen as she doesn’t really consider them friends. 

So Abby is now back from home after missing the first two weeks, and ask our friend what we are doing for Polly’s birthday- me and Pollys mum have arranged a meal and that the mum is going to pay for. So would I be the AH for not inviting Abby as has given no interest in Polly or her life for the last half a year- so its unfair for pollys mum to pay for someone who literally takes no interest in her

377,AmItheAsshole,"Here's a nice and petty one for people way too old for this shit.

I have a ridiculous hobby. I find old My Little Pony toys out at flea markets and junk stores, fix them up, and give them to my friends' kids (or fix their existing ones). Some vintage, some not, if the price is right I will grab them. I resell the truly valuable ones (to pay for more cheap ones and cleaning materials). It's a self sustaining thing I have done since I was in high school, starting with a babysitting client. I have a rotating cast of 2-6 friends/siblings who take me up on this through the years.

The current crew is 4 girls . Girl 1 lives far away, her mom doesn't buy new things at stores because she is crunchy and also gave me her father's fairly expensive camera when he died. She lives and breathes ponies, does not know the other girls. Girls 2 and 3 are sisters who share a collection. Ponies are their second favorite thing after American Girl dolls. Girl 4, whose mom I am closest to, destroys everything and ponies are not even her favorite thing, not even top 5. All three remaining girls know each other.

Most of the ponies these days go to girl 1 for the obvious reasons of it's her absolute favorite thing, she reminds me of me at that age and the reason I do this to begin with (plus the camera, I feel indebted). Nobody knows her from the other group. Recently girl 4's mom figured out that I give the nice and more re-saleable ponies to 2+3, more vintage goes their way (although 4 ends up with more ponies overall). I guess her daughter noticed (more likely it was pointed out to her) and got upset. Mom is pissed. She loved them too as a kid and has been making an effort to make her daughter keep them nicer these days. On and on. ""It's not fair."" But she's also looking at it from a ""each family gets this percentage of vintage ones"", hell maybe she just even has some rivalry with girls 2+3s mom that I am unaware of. Sides are taken, because small town bullshit. Weird drama where apparently I am a monster.

None of these toys are in bad shape. It's not like I am giving her pre-destroyed stuff here, but if I have two identical ones, I will give #4 the one whose hair is a touch frizzier because it's just going to end up in the rat king of ponies in her toybox because she doesn't like brushing anyway.

378,AmItheAsshole,"Partner and I are expecting our first child this summer. This will be the first grandchild on his family's side, so kind of A Big Deal.

Partner's job requires us to move, often internationally, every 2-3 years. We like this lifestyle overall but it comes with obvious challenges, one of which is material possessions. We have to be very intentional about what we own because there's a weight limit for our household goods shipments, and additionally, certain products simply don't work overseas. Electrical outlets/wattage are different, for example. Or, if we end up in a hot country, we won't be bringing winter clothes.

Now, we will be moving to Asia a few months after the baby is born. We have very carefully curated a registry that contains **exactly** what we need and **only** what we need.

I don't expect people to give gifts, as we are quite capable of purchasing what we need, but I know that they will want to, so I'd really like to minimize the influx. I've been trying to figure out how I might communicate to friends and family who will definitely want to give us gifts (especially my MIL) to please, please only purchase items from the registry. There is a varied selection of items at all price points, so nobody has to spend more than they are comfortable with. There are a few higher-end items, but most are less than $50. I just don't know how to express this without sounding ungrateful and entitled, or if I should say anything at all and just let people buy whatever they want and donate what we can't use.

So WIBTA for asking people to consider our imminent overseas move and to not go off the registry?

380,AmItheAsshole,"
I (24f) have a coworker (27M) who I’m pretty good friends with. He is married; I am not. We don’t do anything outside of work or anything, but we talk a lot at work and have this kind of antagonistic, making-fun-of-each-other relationship, but we also talk about serious stuff sometimes too. I wouldn’t say we’re best friends or anything, but as far as work acquaintances go, I’d say we’re pretty close. 

So apparently, according to another one of my coworkers, it seems like we’re more than friends, or at least that I like him or something. She’s constantly shooting me dirty looks when I’m talking to him and has insinuated a few times that I’m flirting with a married guy. She even does this when I laugh at his jokes or something. He’s super funny and he makes me laugh. We’re friends, so sometimes he tries to make me laugh. I don’t see this as a big deal but apparently she does. I can sort of see how she could see what we’re doing as flirting, but it’s all innocent and I would never take it any further, and I’m assuming he wouldn’t either. We never even hug. It’s all just making fun of each other, cracking jokes, and talking. 

So I bring all this up because she actually confronted me about it today. I was going out to run an errand for work and he asked me if I would go get him some food. He gave me money and I was more than happy to do it for him. I probably would have done it for any of my coworkers, but I was more than happy to do it for him because we were friends. 

So I come back and she sees me with the food and stops me as I’m going to go find him and says “I can’t believe you actually bought him food!” I told her that I technically didn’t buy it for him since he paid for it, but I just went out and got it for him because I was already leaving the office. He was working through his lunch break today and hadn’t had time to eat so I was more than happy to bring him food since I was already out. She just shook her head and said, “you know he’s married, right?” I just laughed and said of course I knew that, and then I walked out. 

After I brought him the food, I came back and sat at my desk and it had been like 20 minutes and she hadn’t said a word to me, she just kept looking at me and shaking her head. 

Later, he came in and said “hey, thanks for the food. You’re the best!” After he left the room she said “You can do all kinds of stuff for him, but no matter how many times he tells you you’re the best, he’s never going to leave his wife for you!” 

I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. I know she thought our relationship was weird somehow but I couldn’t believe she would actually suggest I was trying to get him to leave his wife, but it got me thinking about whether or not our relationship is actually bordering on inappropriate.

381,AmItheAsshole,"Context: My husband's friend was going thru a divorce, and we let him stay on our couch for about 2 months for free, then he turned into a full room mate taking over the second bedroom and started paying a little bit of rent. (He can't afford his full share of the rent, or to help with utilities.) So now we have a room mate and his dog. (Who gets into the trash and poops inside, but we got a crate for her which has cut that behavior WAY back, and she's very cute.)My mental health is influenced heavily by the cleanliness of my surroundings. Clutter and mess drive me ABSOLUTELY insane. The amount I had to clean up after my husband resulted in A TALK, which he took to heart and changed his ways.  I work at a restaurant, and it is drilled into everyone's heads that the task is not complete until you have cleaned up after yourself. As a result, I am very meticulous about my kitchen at home.

Our room mate is finding ways to cope with the change in his life including cooking more, which is great. I'm glad he found something healthy to do with himself. My problem comes from the fact he doesn't clean up after himself. He usually uses his own pots and pans, but he uses my and my husband's plates/bowls/cutlery etc. as well as my appliances. I constantly find my food processor covered in goo sitting out on the counter (we keep our kitchen gadgets in the pantry to free up counter space) the stove and counters will be covered in drips and splatter from his cooking: I've even found bits of veg stuck to the wall next to the stove. I've told him we usually rinse dishes, then put them in the dishwasher if it's dirty, or empty it first if it's clean. Despite this, the sink is constantly full of dishes he used, but didn't rinse even when the dishwasher is empty, or only partly full of dirty dishes.

I know he's having a hard time, and I'm trying to cut him some slack, but I've cleaned the kitchen every day for the past two weeks, just to wake up the next morning to all of his dirty dishes from both his dinner the night before, and breakfast that morning just tossed in the sink. The fact he leaves yogurt or oatmeal or what ever he happened to have eaten to dry up and get stuck to \*my\* dishes feels disrespectful to me. I want to tell him if he can't be bothered to clean up after himself when he uses our things, he needs to get his own at the very least, but I don't know if I should. I know he's been having a hard time, and I know that he's been going thru some things that I don't know all about, but at the same time the constant mess in the kitchen has literally made me cry from stress. My husband told me he would talk to our room mate if I want him to, but I'm not sure.

My mum was sick for many years and my Dad stepped into a care taker role than a husband role so I understood his new relationship but I still personally struggle knowing he's moved on so quick and I can't help but see the GF as ""the other woman"".

**EDIT**: Some people seem to think that I am not supportive of my Dad having a GF and I can see how you may have seen that with me referring to her as ""the other woman"", however as I said, I understood his relationship. I have been supportive of his happiness this whole time, I've actively asked how she is going and I don't shut the conversation down when she is brought up. But my father and I have had completely different experiences with my mother and our grieving process is reflective of that - I have only just lost my mother but my Dad lost his wife years ago.

386,AmItheAsshole,"A little backstory to help with your judgement might be needed!



At the end of 2019, I took a 23andme test for fun/seeing genetic traits/etc. never thinking anything dramatic would come of it. Results came back and to my surprise, my first cousin had taken it, too! We matched but the results were odd. It showed her as either my second cousin or 1st cousin once removed. 



I asked husband to look at it with me and it became apparent after lots of lots of sorting/googling/etc. that we don't share a grandfather since we share the same maternal group. I called my mother and told her what I'd found. Got her a kit and she sent it in. My mom and I kept this to ourselves until her kit finished this week. 



When my mother's results came back a few days ago, sure enough, my first cousin (her niece) came back half of the % like mine did, showing up to my mother as HER first cousin. So now we know there wasn't an error on both of ours. Because 23andme doesn’t label people as half-aunt or half-cousin, it uses its best guess based on the DNA % matched. My cousin is actually my half-first cousin. Meaning my mom’s sister is actually her half-sister. There really isn’t any other possibility given the results and relatives I know of. Once I was logged in, I could sort that there were over 400 dna matches my mother had that my cousin didn't, which is pretty definitive to me. Someone belongs to the milkman.



We are a pretty close family (or so I thought hah!) so I texted my cousin. I told her our theory and she was in disbelief. She contacted her mother, my mom's sister, and neither of them wanted to ask my grandmother about it. My mom called her sister and they both decided I’m to keep this to myself and not confront my grandmother about it all the while, my aunt claiming the test is wrong. Their reasoning being that “she’s old and not in the best health” and no one wants to open this can of worms. Mentally, she’s still there and still as sassy as ever. 



Today, my mom called me and told me she’s decided I’m to keep this to myself and tell everyone it was an error and nothing came of it. I was floored. I told her there’s no chance of that happening and when or IF I can find a name, I’d be calling my grandmother to ask her who he is. Obviously, I wouldn’t be mean about it or try to hurt her but I do feel like I deserve to know who my real grandfather is. My grandparents are still alive and I will still love them both regardless of what I find. It's also not like I'd be emailing my whole family to tell them the news; I get this is a private thing.



The part I’m conflicted about is, am I being selfish? Is this lady really going to take this secret to her grave and that’s okay because she’s old? I feel like I’m being deprived of possible family and being fed a lie my whole life. How could my mom and her sister not be mad as well? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.



Would I really be an asshole if I ask my grandmother who my real grandfather is?



Edited formatting.

2nd Edit. Since I’m getting eviscerated for involving my cousin who also took the test, I thought I should add what I commented below. I texted her asking if she sent in her sample or her daughters. When she replied back that it was hers, things naturally happened after that. We both were like, “Oh.” From there, she called her mom and asked if she knew anything then the sisters talked about how they wanted to proceed.

I'm not very close with my roommates and normally don't hang out with them or anything, but we get along decently well as roommates, and I figured it would probably be better to room with him than to go for a random. I brought up the idea that we could room together next year and he gladly accepted.

Last week, I was hanging out with one of my close friends again and he mentioned this time that he was no longer planning to room with his current roommates anymore and was thinking about staying on campus instead, which is what I'm doing. He doesn't have a roommate planned, and I would ask if he wanted to be my roommate if only I hadn't made an agreement with my roommate. (For context, the housing application process has not begun, this is all just future planning)

389,AmItheAsshole,"I recently moved in with my partner.

I still own my house, we were renting it out to a lovely couple but they decided to move.

We're obviously looking for someone else to rent, we charge £5000 PCM, it's a 5 bed 2 bath, extensive garden.


My SIL recently got married, they want children so they're having to move from their flat.

She asked to move in to the place we are renting out.

I said no, I just don't feel comfortable doing that.

They're trustworthy people but it's just not something I'd do.

They're now treating me like I'm evil.

390,AmItheAsshole,"With 4 friends of mine, we planed to go to Amsterdam for 9 days this summers. It beeing hard to find cheap lodgings inside Amsterdam, we found an air bnb in Haye (about 45 minutes by bus from Amsterdam). We agrred on that one until the next day where 3 of my friends decided they wanted to go for only 6 days and in hotel room (that is still out of my budget even for just 6 days). When we couldn't settle, they just cancelled the whole thing.
The air BnB in Haye is 150€ cheaper, it has a jaccuzi, a kitchen, a garden, 20 minutes away from the beach (we planned to go in June), smocking and partying aloud, 45 mins from Amsterdam and we even aranged one night in Amsterdam.
The hotel they want is directly inside Amsterdam so we can actually party in Amsterdam at night. But the hotel won't aloud for smocking or partying ofc, and it's just one room. Also, it would mean staying 6 dys instead of nine. But most of all it is out of my price range as I have repeatedly said.

391,AmItheAsshole,"This past fall I spent \~$3000 to overhaul our lawn and spent tons of time, energy and effort obsessively caring for it in hopes the new seed would get fully established before the first frost.

This morning around 9:30 am my wife noticed there was an SUV parked with all four of its tires up our lawn. Needless to say I was pretty pissed as driving on a frozen law [has the potential to kill it](https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/01/winter-lawn-care-tip-avoid-traffic/).

I went across the street and knocked on our neighbors door figuring it was someone visiting their place. All of their cars were there but no one answered the door. I waited a bit and tried again. This process repeated about 4 times over 20 minutes but no one answered so I called the police. They ran the plates, saw the car wasn't from around here and said they would come out and take a look.

About 10-15 after they arrived one of the neighbors (who we get along great with) came back from a walk and said the car belonged to a home health aide that had come to help out his wife. My neighbor apologized and the car was moved.

(***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** *I wasn't irate/mad at the neighbors, the home health aide or police at any point. Once my neighbor came back we had a very cordial conversation and everything was resolved quickly, politely and without any raised tempers.)*

When I came back inside and told my wife what had happened she was pretty upset that I brought the cops into it. She told me I should have just waited and watched out the window to see when the person came back to the car and then asked them not to do it again. She explained that 'the damage was already done' and that leaving the car there for another 30 minutes wasn't going to make anything drastically worse. I told her that I was upset because this person – beyond being careless/rude by parking on someone's lawn and then not being readily available to move their car if asked – could have killed the grass I had spent lots of time/energy/effort/money on.

I told my wife that yeah, if I knew what I know now I would probably have been fine waiting, but when I couldn't reach anyone across the street and had no idea whose car it was I made the decision to call the police (as, at the time, that felt like my best option).

Another thing to add is that we live on a dead-end street and there were TONS of places this person could have parked INCLUDING the driveway of the home they were visiting (which had plenty of space to fit her entire SUV). More than anything else I was just upset that of all the places they COULD have parked my newly-established lawn was deemed their best option.

Was calling the cops in this situation an over-reaction on my part? Am I the asshole?",AITA for calling the cops about a car that was parked on my frozen lawn?
392,AmItheAsshole,"I have been in a relationship for almost a year now. Since day 1 her best friend and majority of her family and friends despise me because I do not practice Christianity. Because of this they (mostly her best  friend and her mother) have caused a lot of strife, separation, fights, and pain between us. My girlfriend's faith is more compassionate and understanding and fortunately not always by the ""book"" which is one of the many reasons I love her.

Our relationship *""officially""* began to her support system recently, when she finally told her family and friends that she wasn't going to allow their opinions and demands affect our relationship anymore. That being with me is what she wants and that she hopes they can support her like she has always supported every one of them when they were in her need. They all said yes. Except her mother and bf who said you can be with him if you want but I don't want him in my life.

I told her that I was fed up with the behavior and treatment she has allowed her friends and family to bestow upon me, our relationship, but most importantly upon her. I told her that I love her, I want to be with her for the rest of my life. That this relationship is VERY important to me, that having respect for ourselves and each other, our mental and emotional health, happiness, and our relationship WILL be my number one priority moving forward and I would no longer turn the other cheek to their bullshit. Either she helps me move this relationship where it needs to be or we cut our losses and move on.

Her bf was recently engaged to her boyfriend a few (3?) months ago. My girlfriend is the bridesmaid. The bf told my gf that this was her day and she does not want me at her wedding or at any of the dinners or events. My girlfriend does not like her friend's choice but she understands the situation and that on that day and only that day she agreed that it would be her responsibility to make sure she's there for her bf. I told her you have been there for your bf at the expense of our relationship since we met. That EVERY DAY has been her day and enough was enough.

I told her that if she wants to go she needs to figure out a way for me to be there at her side, and if she goes to the wedding without me we're done because I am not going to be with someone who continues to allow this behavior.

Yes I understand all the implications and emotions and blow back and issues and *everything* my ultimatum entails, I understand it's just one day and one last battle that we have to lose, but i'm at the point in my sanity and integrity where bending just one more time is one time too much.

AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: NO I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE WEDDING. What I want is for her to call her best friend out on her bullshit and stand up for our relationship.

Edit 2: Her family is from the south, VERY religious, very strong in their heritage and roots. My religion is completely against what they believe, even though the teachings and general message are identical. 

Edit 3: I would appreciate everyone who has taken a piece from what they read and ran to the comment section to say how im manipulative or controlling or an asshole or whatever else you assumed. Let these comments be an example of how it feels to be in a relationship with people who don't know you, don't bother to know you, and take one thing you say and just call you the worst things and make you look like the biggest piece of shit. If you are one of these people I hope you take a good long hard look in the mirror and fix whatever issue you have with yourself and that you are able to find a more positive disposition in life towards others.",AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum about her BF's wedding?
393,AmItheAsshole,"Edit:

Hubby was venting to his sister about all of this while I was turning to the anonymity of the internet. She is a social worker and has told us basically we're fucked in the head for even considering giving up our third.  She then called his mom who freaked the fuck out on us.  She said that if we even attempt to give up custody of our 3rd she'll sue for all 3.  I'd die for my kids...so we have blocked her on all phone and internet.    


She also managed to post on facebook and tag my husband and I the past 3 hours has been an absolute shit show.    


Everyone has managed to crawl out of the woodwork.  Family calling us terrible things, friends saying that they are disgusted, random people they tagged saying they want the baby, but basically more hell on earth than we have been going through.   My younger cousin who is currently a college sophomore, however, has offered to come out when her college finishes in April.  All she's asking is for her own room, food and gas money.  We will put the girls together, nbd, and if she watches the kids I'll be able to pick up more hours and it could work.  She's going to come during her spring break, too.  Her parents are pretty wealthy and don't care what she does as long as she's happy.  Everyone else in our families is an ass though and I've had to block so many people on FB.  All we have to do is to survive until the first week March and she'll be helping us for an entire week.  My mom might come out for a few weeks if she can cash out on some vacation owed to her, but I doubt that will happen since she's said it about 30 times in the past 6 months and it's never materialized.  


So kid 3's life is up in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

~~Final~~ Edit:

Given the verdict I showed my husband the post.  At first he was mad but after he cooled off we had a good conversation.  While we wanted and tried for #3 we do not have the mental, physical or financial energy to take care of a 3rd child in light of what the first two needs.   Hell, in light of what the first needs.  We knew none of this when we tried for 3.  We have contacted an adoption agency and have an appointment tomorrow with an agency that specializes in last minute adoptions.  If not, we have printed the safe surrender documents if I go into labor before we can sign those papers.  He has already gotten a vasectomy so we don't have to worry about more.

The kid may or may not get pictures.  It will be up to what their new parents decide (we chose not to find the gender as it is).

EDIT:

I told my husband I'm tapped out.  He is responsible for this and it's all on him if he \*needs\* the special pictures otherwise I'll take regular pictures and figure it out later.  I have the older 2 who need more attention than I can give right now with actual, life threatening situations.  The kid will have pictures, just not the special one.  It ended badly, as he said that it was a special thing \*I\* did so I obviously care nothing for this baby. We are separating.  He said if I can't treat this kid perfectly equally he will take the baby and I can raise the other two.  I said fine.  Not sure what will actually happen, but I'm getting my ducks in order.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm due with #3 any day now.

I am overwhelmed.  The past 6 months has been shit.  Husband's job changed, less money, I pick up more freelance shifts.

Our 2 and 4yo were diagnosed with ASD...the 2yo was a total surprise because she seems normal just quiet.

Oh, and to make it better, the heart defect that they PROMISED me was ""completely resolved"" in my 4yo when she was 1, was NOT actually resolved and was found in my 2yo.  Because ""lets check her too"" was a complete fucking shit storm.  We are hoping the 2yo's will resolve because it seems minor but I'm fighting with the asshole insurance to go to a better provider because I don't want to go to the office that had me thinking everything was AOK for 3 years and now she might need surgery.

Basically my life during pregnancy has been fuck you on a stick and I will need to do 10 BILLION Doctor's appointments, EI comes weekly for 2yo, I have to drive for the 4yo's interventions and it's basically like my life was turned upside down.

Last night my husband was looking at pictures and the colleges that I did for the 2 &amp; 4 yo with taking pictures of them every month.

I rolled over and was like, ""well not happening with this one.""

My husband was pissed.  He thinks it's highly unfair and even cruel.  I don't have time.  WE don't have time.  Our lives are just fuckery right now.  Not our fault.  We didn't imagine any of this when we decided to go for #3.  He said he'd help pick up the slack, (he does his fare share) take care of the older two so I could take a picture,  but this was something that I did with them and I needed to do it with #3.  I can barley remember my own name sometimes never mind the forethought it's going to take to get everything all set up with the month thing and take a picture.  We have nothing left to give and we're adding a kid.  I told him that he could take the picture if it mattered that much, but he reminded me that he has to travel and there are many days he isn't home before the kids go to bed.

He thinks I'm being an asshole and I'm going to make the kid hate me from day 1.

EDIT:  We both take pictures, this is in regards to one of those pinteresty things.  We don't post it on FB we just make a photo collage for ourselves.

EDIT 2:  Again he can't just take them himself because of work.  He's often out of town during the week or he has to work late.  It sucks, but that's our life for the next 1-2 years until he gets his cert.",AITA for saying I'm not going to do the same for kid 3 as I did for 1&amp;2
394,AmItheAsshole,"My friends and I are having a serious disagreement over this, so I thought I'd ask here.

I quit drinking for personal reasons about a month ago. Obviously I still want to hang out with my friends when they go out, so I still accompany them to bars and just drink a Diet Coke instead. 

Before I quit drinking, we would take turns being the designated driver. But ever since I stopped, I've ended up as the driver by default, which I don't think is fair. 

I told them we should go back to trading off as designated driver. Just because I don't drink anymore doesn't mean I want to take on that responsibility all the time. They say it's my choice not to drink and that rotating drivers was only done out of necessity. 

We live in a remote area without Lyft/Uber, so unfortunately that's not an option. There is one taxi company in the area, but we've had bad experiences with the owner (and it's also fairly pricey). Somebody has to be the driver, I just don't think it should automatically be me. AITA?",AITA for refusing to be the designated driver even though I don't drink?
395,AmItheAsshole,"So recently for context, I've had trouble finding work due to my condition (Epilepsy) I'm unable to do EXTREMELY fast paced work (Fast food, warehouse work, etc). So it's been a trying time for me. My Mother allowed me to stay with her and her boyfriend just until I can get on my feet. 

So 3 months into the stay, I've had 2 jobs, none I could keep and have been holding down minimal work doing video editing for people. I've been paying her (although not huge amounts).

So 3 days ago, she comes home late and drunk with her boyfriend and my 2 other younger siblings in the car. I ask how everything went and she tells me I have until tomorrow afternoon to leave. I at first say ""Are you sure, let's talk about it more tomorrow."" And the annoying bf loud mouth gets in my face and says ""SHE'S SURE!! WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH YOUR SHIT ANYMORE!"" 

Next day comes and my stuff is outside. I try to talk to her but I can't say anything without her asking her bf. She's become so dependent on this guy she can't even make a decision on a meal, what pill she should take, and how much (and I'm not exaggerating this I SWEAR TO GOD, I SWEAR) how many breaths of air to breathe in a minute. 

I ask her if she can let me sleep in her car for the night in exchange for $10. She tells me ""NO! YOU ARE 19, YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU CAN FIGURE YOUR OWN SHIT OUT!""

So I've spent the last day or two looking for homeless shelters in my city, and any resources for homeless people, none for Men. All for women. I slept on a park bench last night in the pouring rain. So morning comes, I knock on her door and ask to take a shower. She asks her bf On speakerphone if I can, and he says ""if it's over 10 minutes, call the police"" So I quickly shower and I start the dreaded argument with my mother.

So I told her this during the argument ""You would really let your own son, freeze out in the cold rather than let me wait just until I get my tax return (already filed) and get out""

Then she said the words that sent me into rampage ""If you die, that's your fault, I am not going to help you with your problems"" I spent the next 20 minutes cussing her out until she broke down crying.

She attempted to call the police on me for cussing her out, in her words ""Abusive behavior"" After they found me, they brought me back and assessed the situation and told me to go so everything could calm down. I asked if there were any resources for homeless people and they told me ""No.""


My mother has gone on to lambast me to other family members over social media and has essentially ruined most of my relationships with family under the guided lies and puppetry of her bf. Ever since she's been with this deadbeat loser, she's hasnt been much of a mother to me or my little brother, she just does what her manipulating, drunk Bf says. She listens to his drunk friends who lie about literally everything and has become nothing but a puppet.

396,AmItheAsshole,"I (20M) was at my classmate’s house last night working on a group project. There were four of us on the team. The other three were girls: Haley, Kayla, and Mindy. I’m straight but I don’t have a girlfriend. We picked each other and we’re all pretty much friends by now because we already had several classes together. We had dinner together before heading to Haley’s house to work on the project. Mindy couldn’t make it to the dinner and had to come a bit later. 


While at Haley’s house, we waited for Mindy to come before starting the project. So Haley, Kayla, and I just talked about random stuff. We got to discuss Kayla’s lactose intolerance and how she finds milk to be absolutely disgusting. Right when we were talking about that, Mindy walked through the door. I’m a shy guy and always had a slight crush on Mindy, but I didn’t know how to express that. To be honest, when we were talking about the milk thing, I already thought about Mindy because she has big boobs and fit women with big boobs makes me think of milk lol. 


I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to loudly say the meme “milk truk just arrive” when Mindy walked in, but that’s what I did and didn’t think much of it immediately after I said it. I thought it was humorous and would make Mindy notice my smoldering sense of humor. However, I faced a tough crowd. Mindy asked me what I said. I said it was just a dumb meme from years ago. She asked me what it meant. I didn’t want to make it any more awkward, so I said it’s pretty self-explanatory. 


Haley said that was an extremely weird thing to say. Kayla said ditto to that. I said that I thought they would find it funny. Haley said she didn’t find that funny at all. Kayla said ditto to that again. I said that we should get cracking on the project. Mindy asked me if the joke was directed at her boobs. I said she already knew the answer to that and let’s not waste any more time since it’s already late. Mindy said she didn’t feel comfortable working with me anymore. I told her to stop being a drama queen and I apologized for making the dumb joke around girls. 


Mindy asked Haley if she could borrow a jacket to prevent me from ogling her. Haley said sure and went to her room to grab one. I told Mindy to stop making it awkward for me. She said I made it awkward for everyone. Alright, I was a quite sad the girl I had a little crush on turned sour on me. We worked on the project for four hours and called it a night. I felt awkward the whole time. We have to meet a few more times until we complete it.

397,AmItheAsshole,"So just a little bit of back story to this situation,  I met MB while temping for my current job.  MB is (31) 5 kids from a previous marriage and 3 in her current, I am (21) single, no kids.  MB's partner does not work, and they live with his parents where they do not pay any bills (this is important later) and they do not have custody nor do they pay child support for any of their kids.  

Me and MB temped together for around 5 months before she was let go.  We were friends, we carpooled to work and took our breaks and lunches together.  We were also cubicle neighbors, so safe to say we spent around 12 hours a day together.  She was ultimately let go due to her poor attendance(MB's life was always in shambles) , lack of respect for upper management, and her inability to stay off her phone at work.  The job is a great job, decent pay and really good benefits. But for some reason MB never had any money even after we got paid. 

Anyways for the 2 weeks after MB was let go, she hardly reached out to me.  Until mid December right before Christmas she called me to ask if she could borrow some money for gas because her 2 new jobs haven't paid her. I usually don't lend money out, but i went against my better judgement, she promised she would pay it back the following week.  She showed up at my house wearing brand new uggs, and airpods and an Adidas sweatsuit.. Okay no big deal for someone who doesn't have money right? Ha..  A week passes, no word from MB. 2 weeks and i text her to see when she would be able to pay me back, 2 days later she responds "" Sorry, my sons been in the hospital his lungs are failing, ill be home by the weekend."" She lives down the street from me and her car was always home when i was on my way home, her kids live 4 hours away. 

I text her over the weekend and ask how her son is doing and no response.  Another week passes and i tell her "" if you need more time that's fine, but i would prefer for you to update me so that i don't have to keep asking.""  Her Pitty-me ass response,"" Yes i can pay you back..(Blah blah) in the midst of almost losing me my son you're pressuring me for money, some friend you are.""  Anyways the weekend rolls around and she tells me she can just cash-app me.  I agree, i wake up in the morning to only a portion of what she borrowed.  I text her and let her know i'm expecting the rest and would like to get it out of the way.  She sends me the rest later in the day, after telling me she is pregnant, again.  

I don't feel like asking her to pay me back is an AH move, but i feel like an AH for assuming shes lying about her kid being in the hospital, and that being the reason she couldn't pay me back on time.  To be honest, I would've let her have the money if she asked, its the principle and i expect people to keep their word.

400,AmItheAsshole,"2 weeks ago she commented on a mutual friend's FB post bashing a prominent figure for their voting habits, I made an offhand reply that who they voted for is human garbage but is still 1000x better than another guy. 

She called me and started screaming. I hung up and ignored her next call. She then got on the post and called me an uninformed idiot and that I was too young to be informed (again, I am 34). She then made a post on her page that she was leaving Facebook until the 2020 election was over because she just couldn't stand to see these idiot opinions especially coming from family members.

I kinda snapped. Years of arguments, mocking my non-Christian friends beliefs (to me not to them) and her negativity and nastiness to my husband finally came to a head. I sent her an angry text saying I was sick of it and that I couldn't believe she would side with party politics over her own daughter. 

We skipped our weekly get together the next day (my dad came to our house instead)

She replied with an e-mail. I didn't see it for a few days and once I did my anxiety was so high I put off reading it for a few more. 

The e-mail went on about the political bs again, more calmly, but then she spouted off against my husband. She told me about all the doubts her friends had had about him when we got married, she attacked that fact that he has female friends and that we all spend a lot of time with one of them from his work. She said a lot of nasty things.

I replied as calmly as my rage would allow and told her she was wrong, it was not her business and that I could not believe she would say those things so blatantly. I was crushed, sobbing, curled up in the fetal positions hardly able to breath. 

Then she replied by doubling down. Accused him of abuse because he never let's us do things with them (total horseshite btw we do things with them at least once a week and have even gone on trips when my husband couldn't join because of work) saying she was worried he was going to hurt me or my boys. Claiming the change in me (from being her little clone to my own woman) was proof he was manipulating me. 

So I called her, left a VM saying I refuse to see her anymore and she is not welcome in my home. I told her that she is trying to drive a wedge between myself and my husband, and that if she was going to make me choose I would choose my husband and my family over her.

But now that has but my dad in a bad position and it going to affect my kids deeply. We did so much with them and now we won't be able to and I am so upset.  I am worried I made a wrong call.

401,AmItheAsshole,"They both live with me right now. I'm feeling like a major asshole for even considering this, but here are my reasons. My son has a good job and can pay part of his way. My daughter has a shitty job and can't. My son and I want to go to London for the whole time. My daughter wants to go to Paris part of the time. But here's the main reason: my son and I get along, and when we disagree, we talk it through like adults with no screaming or name-calling. My daughter not so much. She just loses her shit completely from time to time, and will scream and break things and no one can calm her down. Just a week ago, she had a tantrum because I wouldn't let her use my car, even though I offered to (and did) pay for her Lyft. She followed me in my room to scream at me and closed my laptop with her foot so I couldn't work. I just really don't want to deal with something like that in a foreign country, in some guy's Airbnb.

On the one hand, consequences for not controlling your temper.

402,AmItheAsshole,"One of my friends, let’s call her Mindy, is getting married this summer and it’s getting to be time to plan her bachelorette party. Her MOH, she can be Marylin, thinks it would be brilliant to do a party bus party even though Mindy has expressed wanting to take a trip with all of her friends. 


Well, seeing that Mindy threw a great bachelorette for me last summer I decided I needed to take it in my own hands and plan a second bachelorette, more to what she wanted. Marylin doesn’t really know yet but will know soon. I have planned four days in Las Vegas staying at a suite and Mindy is all for it. 


Marylin always seemed threatened by mine and Mindy’s friendship because she’s the childhood best friend and Mindy and I met in college. Mindy and I clicked instantly when we met and were randomly placed as roommates. It’s not me tooting my own horn either. Mindy’s other friends and family think that Marylin is slightly bitter that her best friend found another friend. 


Am I the asshole for throwing a separate party more to what Mindy wants without consulting Marylin about it? Way I see it, Mindy deserves the bachelorette party of her dreams and just because it’s significantly cheaper and more convenient for her to do a stale ass party bus doesn’t mean she should.

Ok hear me out. So I’m a fan of the game of basketball and I frequently watch the NBA and play basketball. Once per week me and my friends go to our local basketball gym to play pickup basketball. The place only has open gym (meaning anyone can use the court) from 6-10 pm. I live one mile away from this gym. My Dad for the past year has been in and out of the country since he runs his own business and has a lot of clients out of the country so he isn’t in the USA for 50-60% of the year, and I don’t live with my Mom (she and my Dad are divorced). Because of this situation, I am forced to ask for rides from this one friend of mine, and he clearly doesn’t like doing this because I’m a bit off course from his usual route. I also know he doesn’t like doing this because he’s implied pretty obviously with his attitude towards giving me rides. I don’t have any other friends living super close by that go to this court. Most of my friends have Drivers Licenses, but because of law (can’t drive anyone but relatives for one year) they can’t drive me. The friend I am talking about here doesn’t have a DL so his parents drive him to the court, and pick me up and drop me off. So with all this laid on the table, AITA for making him do this for me or is he the asshole? Please be as honest and as transparent as possible.

404,AmItheAsshole,"My boyfriend of 3 years is getting a blood test done next week to see if his blood type matches his uncles and if it does he's going to donate his kidney to his uncle. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting him to do that ? 

The reason his uncle needs a kidney is because he's an alcoholic and ruined his own kidneys and he will die if he dosent get a transplant. 

I understand and I sympathise with him. But honestly the last time he heard from this uncle he was still a little kid they have nothing to do with each other. His whole family are getting tested to see if anyone matches his blood type but it seems to be going in the direction of if my boyfriend matches then he will be the one to donate it...

Why does he have to be the one to donate the kidney? Is it wrong of me to be secretly hoping he dosent have the same blood type as his uncle ?

My friend said that the quilt is kind of tacky, which I’ll admit it’s kind of “loud”. I told her that my mom made it and she said “that’s nice but I wouldn’t sleep with someone who has something like that on their bed”.

408,AmItheAsshole,"TLDR: we have a friend who invites himself to our gatherings. Should we keep hanging out with him out of pity? 


We’re a group of friends struggling with a dilemma. I will be speaking on my own behalf, as there are a couple of different opinions amongst the group.

We all met in high school/college and still see each other a lot after graduating. There’s this one guy, let’s call him John, who is not considered to be one of my close friends - he just always seems to be around and sometimes, somehow, invites himself to our gatherings. John is sweet, caring, intelligent - no doubt that he’s a very warm-hearted person - but he has a very annoying behaviour when in larger groups. He’s intrusive, loud and frankly very inappropriate in many conversations (with overly sexual comments for the most part). Many times it feels like he’s just speaking to be heard, not because he has an actual point. My suspicion is that he has low self esteem and tries to (unsuccessfully) imitate the people around him whom he thinks are “cool”. We’ve never asked him, but we’re all sure that he’s on the spectrum because his social skills are pretty much the quintessence of Asperger’s syndrome. 

Since graduating, he’s become more intrusive and harder to be around (some of us are more affected by this than others). He’s still invited out of pity by some of the others, which we’ve all done a lot throughout the years. But I don’t want to invite him to gatherings that I am hosting anymore. I don’t want to be friends with someone out of pity, and I do not think he should have friends who doesn’t actually want him around (although this doesn’t apply to everyone in the group - a few doesn’t mind and  are coping with the situation better than most of us). In my opinion, he shouldn’t try to change who he is, but he should have the opportunity to find some friends who actively chooses to be his friend, instead of wasting his 20’s trying to fit in.

I hosted something at my place a few weeks ago, and chose not to invite John. I told the others not to speak to loudly about the event, but I also feel like an asshole, telling them to lie or at least hide something from him on my behalf.

These last couple of months we’ve been discussing the situation a lot and as I see it, we have 3 options; 1, we keep inviting him out of pity, 2, we stop inviting him without telling him why (which would be super weird) or, as I would prefer, 3, we talk to him about it. 

Option 3 is scary because no one wants to hurt his feelings. But isn’t it hurting him too, if we just keep up the pitying?

411,AmItheAsshole,"I'll try to be unbiased about this. 

I've had a good friend since middle school. At this point I've known him most of my life. When I moved away for college, we obviously didn't hang out very much due to distance but still stayed in touch. 

I moved back to our home city for law school, though at the time he was dating a girl and he didn't get out much because he spent his time with her. Obviously, that's fine. 

When they broke up, he wanted to hang out all of the time and would get upset when I wasn't available. At this point, we lived about 45 minutes away from eachother. He would regularly come to me talking about how he was sad and wanted to spend time with friends so of course I tried to be there for him as much as possible. 

After a while, he got over her and started focusing on himself and we would still see each other once a week or so. Eventually, I would ask him to hang out and he would say no every time. Somewhere amidst all of this I was also having bouts with depression the same way he had been but he didn't seem to care as much as I had. 

More recently, he never asks to hang out and I never bother either because he doesn't ask me either. His birthday was a few months ago and he didn't invite me but I know he went out and did things. 

I won't say I'm mad or resentful. More just like I don't want to bother with him. The rare occasions he does ask to hang out I usually don't respond anymore. Maybe it is resentment. 

But what got me wondering if I'm being an asshole is that I had dinner with a mutual friend of ours this week. We were all three really close and have been for as long as I can remember. So of course the friend thats the subject of this post came up. I told her ""Yeah, I don't really ask him to hang out anymore. He always says no."" She told me ""Well, he asked me to hang out last week."" So my logical response was ""Dang, do you think I made him mad or something?"" and she told me no. She said, ""I think you're just taking this thing too personally."" I said back to her, ""Well, yeah I am, I have a reason to."" 

I haven't overtly been rude to him about it. In fact I drove out to see him not too long ago. But I have told our mutual friend I think he's being a bad friend to me. And I do think that. 

So I guess the question here is does my feeling slighted or that he's been a bad friend make me an asshole?

Edit: Its probably worth mentioning that he's treated our mutual friend the same way and she doesnt seem bothered by it the way I do. That's what got me wondering too.",AITA for putting less effort into a friendship?
412,AmItheAsshole,"I (22M) moved into my (very cheap) London flat last August along with three other strangers. Two of these strangers are brothers (\~24M,\~26M). I tried to build a bit of rapport with them but they were only interested in hanging out with each other. I also made small talk with the third flatmate (\~25F). She's lovely and entertains it but lives her own life. She sometimes has her boyfriend round and the odd friend just like myself. We make small talk and have absolutely no issues.

As people who just hung out with each other the brothers never really got it when I had friends round. This would mostly be one at a time and for the odd weekend. Small talk diminished to nothing after the first time I had my boyfriend round. They passively aggressively mentioned it every time I had any friend round. I once asked them if I could have five friends round between 7PM-10PM on a Saturday for my birthday. They flipped out at this because it was during dinner time and went for a walk telling me to be done by 9:45PM. This is when they pretty much stopped even acknowledging me when I said ""hello"" in the morning. Strangely, the brothers have never really had much problem with 25F's visitors.

The boys first actual complaint came a couple of months ago asking me not to go up and down the stairs too much after 10PM. I found this absurd but said ""yeah, whatever"" and continued as I was. This only brought more tension but was not tension but I think they let it go and started blaming the lack of doors that are able to close.

That was until this morning when I received an excessively passive aggressive complaining that I was using the kitchen at midnight (I stay up doing work quite late and get hungry) and went to the bathroom at 0130. The requests made were that I do not cook after 11PM, gently lose the bathroom door at night if I have to go, and that I don't leave noodles in the sink.

There were two small noodles in the sink catcher but I conceded this and and said I would try to be quieter but was already doing my best. I then responded that I would not enforce a curfew on myself in a flat I pay equally for. I said that there are many things they do to annoy me, such as reserve the bathroom for each other in the morning, but I don't complain because that is what they choose to do. I suggested that they get earplugs or sleeping medication or if they can't tolerate living in a cheap shared flat with strangers, then they don't.

After a pedantic response, I ended the discussion by reiterating that I would keep using the kitchen whenever I wanted but be quiet about it and I would not be discussing this any further.

I do feel bad for (\~25F) who is lovely and I have not asked her whether she is being kept up by me but the two brothers are self-interested and intolerant people and I hope they move out cause of me. AITA?

416,AmItheAsshole,"I work in a building, which has about 15 separate offices/businesses on one floor. We have shared bathrooms at the end of the hall; male, female and then one private disabled stall. Just for the point of this post, I will say that I never use the disabled bathroom, as I feel it should be reserved for those with disabilities. Lately, when I have been walking to the bathrooms I have been seeing multiple people (all from the same company - they have uniforms), locking the disabled bathroom stall from the outside, making it look like there is someone is occupying the toilet even if there isn't. 

I feel like this is really wrong and this morning when I saw a guy locking it from the outside yet again, I confronted him by asking him what he was doing. He told me that it was none of my business and started walking off, I kept talking and said that I felt it was really rude to be locking the disabled bathroom from the outside in case someone else needs to use it. I also said I felt that it wasn't his own private bathroom to lock up when he pleased. Please note that I wasn't assuming that he didn't have a disability by saying this. Without even turning around, he told me I need to 'get a life' and yelled out 'do you see anyone in a wheelchair on this floor?'. He then walked into his office slamming the door behind him. 

The guy that I confronted knows where I work and which company I work for, and so later on today he went up to one of my coworkers and started to bad mouth me.

417,AmItheAsshole,"I'm a high school senior, I'm friends with the sort of nerdy group at school.

Some of my friends are not really assertive and I feel pretty protective of them because they deserve respect and aren't getting it. There's a big bullying problem at my school, and the teachers are useless. 

So I went to talk to my homeroom teacher about a couple things.

Like one guy who's girlfriend encouraged him to flirt with my friend ask her out, then be like ""Lol you thought I was serious?"" 

Or another one of my friends who was cyberbullied, someone was going to all their social media and sending nasty messages, and were even making new accounts to do it after they were blocked. 

One more of my friends had some really nasty rumors spread about her promiscuity, all total lies.

That was a few weeks ago, and now, I don't think she or the school admin did enough. They met with the people I mentioned by name, who all denied stuff, and there were basically no consequences. Like the people who were bullies are total teachers pets, and the teachers know them as people who are really involved in school activities, school spirit and leadership stuff.

So this week, I went back to my homeroom teacher and asked to talk to her after school. We met and I said that it is disgusting that the school brushed things under the rug. 

She said that it wasn't pushed under the rug, everyone involved was met with.

I said that if any of this happened in a workplace, it would not be called 'bullying'... It would be called sexual harassment... Stalking and harassment... Defamation, libel, slander... Hate crimes against a protected class.. Stuff that would have real consequences, not a ""talking to"".

I told her that if a coworker of hers did any of that shit; if they got inappropriate with her, if they spread gossip about her sex life, there would likely be a lot less tolerance. She'd be able to go to her boss, HR, the cops. That stuff is unacceptable to do to anyone, but it seems that since we're young, it's brushed off as ""bullying"" rather than what it really is. Deeply inappropriate, disrespectful, dehumanizing, and often illegal. 

And I found it disgusting that the school would treat it like harmless bullying, when it was behavior that they would likely never put up with themselves.

And she basically didn't seem to listen to what I was saying, she told me off for my tone of voice, for my bad language. And she said that I was not in a position to criticize the school's handling of these issues.

I snapped at her and said ""yes i fucking am; they affect my friends every damn day and it's disrespectful that you won't listen to what I'm saying.""

She ended the conversation there, and later the principal said that I needed to meet with a guidance counselor because of my outburst. I have that meeting tomorrow morning and I don't know what to expect or what to say.

419,AmItheAsshole,"Last year myself and four friends all bought tickets to see Rammstein in my nearby city. None of these friends live near me, ranging from 60 – 400 miles away. Because I live near the venue they were all planning to come spend the night at mine, have some drinks, travel to the venue together and generally just hang out. 

Recently My Chemical Romance announced they are also playing a show on the exact same day as Rammstein. Now personally if I could have the time again I would have booked tickets to see MCR because I’ve never seen them live and they played a huge role in my childhood, whereas Rammstein I’ve seen live over six times so it’s not really anything new to me. Naturally because I had five friends coming to spend the night and I was putting them up, I knew I couldn’t bail on them all to go see this other band, so that was the end of it for me. 

When MCR made this announcement one of the friends messaged me to say how disappointed she was that this has happened, and I agreed but ensured her that we probably don’t need to worry because they’ve been playing multiple shows across all the countries they’ve visited so they’re bound to play more over here too, she agreed and said she hopes they announce more soon. 

Fast forward to this morning when the MCR tickets went on sale. I didn’t even bother to look at them because I knew I wouldn’t be going, but when I opened up social media the first thing I saw was pictures of this friend bragging about how she can’t wait to go see them live in June because she managed to get tickets with her uni friends. She hadn’t messaged me to say that her and her boyfriend were cancelling coming to stay, nor did she message me to say that this was her plan and ask if we want to try and rearrange amongst all of us so we could all go. I personally just feel let down because the way I see it I would have loved to have gone to see them but missed my chance because I was thinking of my friends, but then to have half of them cancel on me this morning without even messaging me to say so kind of hurts.

Husband and I are divorcing.   We have a few kids and live in an area of the US with a notoriously high cost of living. He grew up here, and I've lived here for the entirety of our 10+ year marriage.  His parents (only family he speaks to)  are very close and watch the big kids after school and over the summer. My entire family lives about 3 hours away in a much more rural area. We visit at least quarterly. 

We have agreed to a 50/50 custody split. This means that my incoming child support is around $200 ‐ basically grocery money only. 

I've run the numbers. I can't afford to live here on my income (and child support)  alone.  We were on a tight budget while together,  and I basically have an $1100/ month deficit if I stay in the crummy apartment that I'm in AND pull the kids from private school and send them to the shady (2/10 on goodschools) public school.

421,AmItheAsshole,"I work at a really tight knit company and across the teams we have strong working relationships. Recently a girl (S) started in the same role as me but across a different region. We work closely together on shared projects. 

When I first met S we went out for dinner, got to know one another and she mentioned that she was just recovering from five years with an eating disorder. When she first told me I thought “ wow S is really brave to open up like that” and I respected her for it. 

Fast forward four months. 

Every single meeting or course that we’ve attended S has brought up her eating disorder at some point. Even when we were meeting a potential supplier S found a way to bring it into the conversation. I just don’t think it’s professional.

423,AmItheAsshole,"Been thinking about this for a long time....

Had a conflict w a friend a while back &amp; are no longer friends. I have been wondering since if I was in the wrong or if I did everything I could to “save” the friendship. I miss her. 

My friend, “Pat” was getting married. I was asked to be a bridesmaid even though I was pregnant. I know they were going to be paying for the wedding themselves, and their families didn’t have a lot to contribute. I called her mom and offered to host a small surprise bridal “brunch”, on my dime. Coordinating w her mom, I ordered catering, got favors &amp; decor, and bought and mailed invites. To make this part short, another bridesmaid lost her sh*t and harassed me that SHE was supposed to be the MoH, it was HER best friend, etc etc (pats sister was the MoH) and I am ROBBING her of the opportunity to throw her BFF a bridal shower AND she was going to have Her own bridal shower the same day, and Pat was going to go to hers, etc.  I never answer a single text bc they were beyond harassment, but I did speak to pats mom who was in my side. In the end, I wound up telling the bride that I was planning this party for her and let her decide what she wanted to do. She said she didn’t want a brunch but she also cut the other bridesmaid from her wedding party. To my knowledge they didn’t speak again. I was really upset about the situation for a while. 

During this time I got HG &amp; was nauseous 24/7. I lost a lot of weight and was depressed. I tried my best to keep in touch, attend fittings, help her pick out a dress, go to NYC to see what she picked, etc. I honestly didn’t want to do any of it bc I puked non stop and felt like crap. I know a text doesn’t take much effort but I felt like I needed to be selfish during this time between caring for my 2 year old, being pregs, and struggling with depression. I did offer many many times to go with her to my parents vacation home in Florida for a bachelorette, but she said it wasn’t good enough, she wanted to go to Vegas/Miami/someplace that would make her fiancé “jealous.”

One day she asked me to go to AC  last minute (1 week notice) for a semi- bachelorette and I said I couldn’t bc a. I was too sick and b. I had a previous family commitment. She got mad and we didn’t talk for a good 2 months. 

We finally talked but things were different. I guess the final straw was her asking for the bridesmaids to pay $300+tip for hair/ makeup. W a hotel room &amp; a gift I was going to be well over $1k and I wasn’t exactly in a financial situation to spend that. I asked if I could get hair/makeup done on my own and she flat out told me not to bother even coming to the wedding. We never spoke again. I think she felt that since she didn’t have a shower (though I had already put out some $ on the one I had planned) or a bach that I should have been ok with spending the $ on her wedding day. I think she feels I made zero effort &amp; I feel I tried my best given my circumstances.

425,AmItheAsshole,"Wife and I are currently in the hospital, she's recovering from a c section surgery and we've welcomed our third child into the world. She's a beautiful healthy baby girl who, of course, requires near constant care. I haven't left my wife's side since we arrived two days ago, except for about an hour or so when I went for a walk. I jump up and help the moment I hear the baby fuss. My wife can't do much as she recovers so I'm really trying to step up my game for her. Then at about 545 am after getting a total of 45 minutes sleep baby starts going again. Wife has had a few hours of sleep as she works through the meds. Baby is very gassy and needs a lot of walking and burping. Walking over to pick her up I deep sigh and say I'm getting frustrated, not in an angry way, just in a tired and defeated way. She got very upset at me, saying how I shouldn't get so frustrated and I'm not being a good Dad. I told her she should cut me some slack, that I've been here helping my absolute best. She has since called me an asshole, said to stop talking to her and is threatening to change our post hospital plans. I'm trying to be very patient but I'm also struggling with some recent mental health issues of my own. Now even though we're arguing, I'm still doing the baby tasks just the same and haven't left. I've gotten her everything she's asked, taken care of 90% of diapers and post-feeding burps, and been as sweet as possible to her (saying how proud I am and what a great mother she is ... All very true, but she doesn't reciprocate). I think I've earned a bit of slack and patience from her? She thinks I should keep my deep sighs and comments of frustration to myself, and has straight up called me an asshole for getting frustrated, once. 

AITA?

Edit: thanks everyone for your candid responses. My wife and I have slept a bit and both apologized to each other and are closer than ever to be honest. Even though this is our third child we've been through several miscarriages and numerous other heartaches over the decade together but we love each other deeply and our children even more. The reason this is so different than our lasts is completely on me. I've been diagnosed with ADHD (a year ago) and severe depression (after losing my job with a pregnant wife) and have been going through different meds trying to find the best balance. This makes it difficult for me to focus and process complex emotions ... a lack of sleep doesn't help either. However I must accept my part in this and face these things head on.

I considered deleting this post as the flair calls me out as an asshole, but I think this can be turned into a good thing: if even a single person can be benefited from hearing these struggles can actually bring you closer with your partner. My wife, after reading these responses, has reassured me I'm not the asshole and loves me dearly. Which, to be frank, is much more important than what y'all say :) 

Thank you again for those objective insights. It has honestly helped.",AITA for being frustrated with my two day old daughter?
426,AmItheAsshole,"My husband and I were married for 3 years. He died in a car accident 8 months ago. It was absolutely devastating.

When we got married, I took his last name. I didn’t want to that badly but talked myself into it. Sharing a family name is so nice and I wasn’t interested in hyphenating. Getting used to a new name is weird. I really love my family and they have been a huge support through this whole ordeal. I do like my husbands family but I was never particularly close to them. 

I made the decision to go back to my maiden name. Since my husband is gone, we have no kids and I’m not close to his family I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. It’s my name - I have to live with it and I want to share a name with my family who are super important to me.

My former in-laws freaked when they found out. They said I was being disrespectful to my husbands memory and to them. They said it looks like I’m trying to erase him from my history. Some of my husbands friends expressed disappointment as well.

I think that’s an overreaction. I will always love and miss my husband. I don’t think my last name changes that. AITA? Is it disrespectful?

EDIT: this really blew up overnight. Thank you all for your kind words.
In the comments I mentioned that I changed my name on Facebook. The only people who knew about my name change before this were my mom and sister.

I’m not sure what the protocol is for changing your name. I didn’t tell anyone ahead of time when I changed it the first time.

I said he was wrong because I knew someone who worked in law who said you can be jailed maximum 2 years for fraud and he didn't know anything about law and he didn't know the circumstances of my friend.

432,AmItheAsshole,"My roommate has a cat. He got her 3 years before I moved in with them, and she is a fucking *brat.* The problem comes with the fact that this cat? Loves me the most out of everyone in the household. At home I shower her in attention, and when I was at my old job I worked the evening shift, so I could stay up super late and she would hang out with me and I'd give her even more attention.  Hell I could wake her up, pick her up, and drape her over my shoulder like a baby and she wouldn't care as long as I petted her.

I recently got a new job where I wake up at 7 AM to be at work at 8, instead of working 1 PM to 9 so I've spent the past month unfucking my sleep schedule.

434,AmItheAsshole,"Here I am again with another roommate moral dilemma. 

So my apartment comes with one parking spot. When we both moved my roommate didn’t have a car but I did. I never used it much. 

A year ago my roommate got her car, and we came to the agreement that she’d use one week and I’d use it one week. Which then change she’d use it in the daylight because her cars paint job was getting ruined which eventually became in just her using it. There’s even been occasions when we both go on break and leave both our cars here, hers inside and mine outside. I didn’t care much because as I mentioned I never even used it a lot to begin with. 

I do ask her for the parking spot from time to time for whatever reason (I don’t think the reason matters that much because either way she uses it more than me), in the past it used to be maybe max 4 weeks at a time. For a few months now it’s only been 3 days every 2 weeks, which doing the math ends up on her yet again using it for the majority of the time. 

This weekend it’s going to be one of those weekends that I need to use it. Since I arrived earlier than her, I just put my car outside as a way of being like hey I’m using it this weekend. 
That way she won’t put it in and then have to go take it out later when I need the spot. 
So anyway, I go walk my dog I come back and she’s here already. 

She had the nerve to ask me if I could move my car. I said oh no sorry, I’m using it this weekend. And she asked are YOU using it? Emphasis in the you. I said no. (Which in my opinion doesn’t matter what do I do with the damn parking spot. If I want to tell a stranger to park there in MY time I have the right). 
Well she made the bitchiest face I’ve ever seen, and of course I was appalled, like how does she have the nerve to 1) question me and 2) make a face.  


So I told her very passive aggressively that as a matter of face we can start using the parking spot one week her and one week me. 
Which honestly I don’t give a damn but I just did it out of pure spite. 

Just to add she’s never had an issue (that I could tell) when I’ve asked her for the parking spot so I’m thinking it might’ve been the fact that I didn’t ask her. 
But then again she never asked me either.

435,AmItheAsshole,"**I have offered to cut the friendship off completely, but my husband keeps going back and forth on what he wants so I don't know what to do.**

My husband and I are part of a board game group that met twice a month. We're in our thirties and have both had trouble meeting new people, so I was excited by this opportunity. One guy in the group (Mike) and I ended up hitting it off really well. I really enjoy talking to him and consider him a close friend. Mike and my husband get along fine in the group setting, they just don't have much in common that would cause them to hang out or talk outside of game sessions.

My husband is 100% into cars and videogames, while I'm into art and literature. I play videogames with him, but I've tried sharing some of my interests with my husband and it goes nowhere. Mike and I both have desk jobs, so during slow days at work we'd talk about books and give each other fun writing prompts. We were both really into writing in college and so it was fun to get back into it again and have someone critique the little stories I wrote.

**Mike and I have several fundamental differences that would squash any relationship feelings (different religions, he's poly, I'm monogamous, etc.) Mike has even said verbatim, ""I'm honestly glad you're married because otherwise I would have probably asked you out at some point, it would have failed (either me turning him down or us dating and hitting the previously mentioned issues), it would be awkward, and I'd have missed out on this friendship with you.""**

I never see Mike alone, except one time we ran into each other at a craft fair and looked at stuff together for a short bit. We don't discuss my relationship. We just talk about books or our other niche interests that my husband doesn't care about. **(seriously have tried asking my husband the same questions/writing prompts just as a fun discussion and he looks at me like I'm insane and shoots it down)**

My husband gets pissed off because he thinks that Mike should be ""equal"" friends with him, but any time I try to bridge the gap my husband gets mad. For example, husband and I are trying to get fit in the new year. I mentioned this to Mike, who said, ""I just joined a yoga studio and they have one night a week where you can bring friends for free. You guys should come."" I told my husband, who blew up at me and then gave me the cold shoulder. Mike has only ever invited US to anything, not just me, so I don't understand. My husband always turns him down.

I told my husband the bottom line is HIS FEELINGS. If he hates this guy I'll never speak to him again, but that also means us quitting the gaming group. I need him to decide if he wants to do that, and he keeps going back and forth. Am I a giant asshole here?

No big deal, I text Dave and our other friend who we’ll call Mike, telling them I left the jacket there and to make sure someone grabbed it. I get a response back 10 minutes later from Mike saying “I’m on it” and I pretty much let it go there, thinking everything was taken care of.

8 days later, Dave asks me if he could have his jacket back. And I’m confused saying I thought Mike had it. Mike tells us that he doesn’t have it and forgot about it that night. Obviously Dave is pissed. He’s saying it was his favorite jacket and it costs $230 so how do I want to work this out. So I say I think it’s fair if Mike and I split the cost of it, as I would’ve had a higher sense of urgency and would’ve gone back to the club if need be had I not gotten his quick response that it was taken care of. Both of them are pissed at me, saying I left it there and at the end of the day it’s completely my fault for leaving it there. I disagree. So, AITA?",AITA for not wanting to pay for losing my friend’s jacket?
440,AmItheAsshole,"Her and I have been good friends since we were 16 (we’re now 22). I would say she’s one of my best friends. I have my car at university so whenever we’re going back home at the same time I give her a lift because the trains are really expensive. It’s about a 3.5 hour drive and uses about half a tank of petrol, which would cost me roughly £20. I haven’t been asking her for petrol money since I’d be driving home anyway (although I do always drop her straight at her boyfriend’s house which is 20 minutes away from mine). But she tends to bring a lot of stuff which adds weight and therefore increases petrol usage, probably by not that much though. But now I’m really trying to save as much money as I can, and I’m considering asking her for £5-10 in petrol money each time I drive her home. She’s always a bit stressed about money (I’m pretty sure she has money but just wants to save it which is fair enough) but I feel like she wouldn’t mind giving me petrol money, I just feel awkward asking now since I’ve never asked before. Also, my parents usually fill up my tank before I drive back to uni but not always, but that also makes me feel more guilty. WIBTA?

He decided he is going to leave that apartment and move in with his friends and since I am going to the university I can take over the lease. I ask my sister if she wants to move in with me and split the rent, and she says not really. I don't really care and move on.

442,AmItheAsshole,"I’ve been in a relationship with A for four years now. We live together and as far as I’m concerned he’s my forever person (and I sure hope he reciprocates). 

He‘s always had a terrible relationship with his family. His mother passed 10 years ago, he doesn’t interact with his father unless strictly necessary (they have bad history) and he doesn’t really get along with his sister... especially over the fact that she maintained a relationship with their father, despite some of that history having affected both siblings.
I met his grandma when she was still with us, and I’ve socialized with his sister’s family on a few occasions (and, with my parents insistence, we also had a “family” lunch where they met each other). I’ve never met his father, despite him living right next door to the apartment where his grandma used to live and where we often spent the night when visiting. 

This doesn’t really affect our day to day life, as we live and work a couple of hours where his family is located, but A and his father are in the same trade and his category has a national meeting once a year which they both attend. 
I’ve now accompanied him three times and I expect a fourth time in a few months. 
My parents now and then mention that, once we are there, I should just walk up to his father and introduce myself at some point. Whether A likes it or not, his father is my de facto father-in-law, so we should at least shake hands. I tend to disagree. I’d like to meet the man, but if A doesn’t want me to, I’d rather respect his wishes. I am positive it’s HIS FATHER he doesn’t care about and not a weird issue about not wanting to introduce ME. He doesn’t want him in his life, so he doesn’t want to “share me” with him in any way or form.

443,AmItheAsshole,"I work in the service industry. Pizza actually. dinner rush gets very busy sometimes and our store is typically understaffed, and the staff we have is not well trained. 

We have one employee that typically shows up at minimum 40 minutes late for every shift. I mean literally EVERY SHIFT. if it's a typical day and we actually get busy then we end up in the weeds pretty quickly. Not only does this person not show up on time, they generally take an extra 15 minutes past what is the expected time for a delivery (even though as a closer they deal with the least amount of traffic on the road).  And then they do a very poor job of cleaning when they close. I'm pretty sure this person makes close to if not as much hourly pay as me. Well I'm a punctual person and I generally expect everyone else just show up for their jobs and do their jobs. It's what they get paid for.

I often complain or at least point out that this person is over 30 minutes late and hasn't called, and I point out the mess and other extra work I have to clean up when I open because it didn't get done the night before. 

Yesterday I posted in our group text that all the employees are in that we needed somebody to come in and close because the person that was scheduled didn't call or show up and was 40 minutes past due. 

a few hours later I get an angry text from this person calling me a self-righteous ass hole, and wishing that I would have to go through what they went through in the past year.

Prior to dating me, he had a longtime girlfriend from the age of 16 or so, on up until about five months before we started dating. They share a beautiful little girl together, who’s 10 months old, and the breakup was amicable. 

This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went out clubbing together, and just who do we run into but his baby mama. I saw her first, and made an effort to avoid her because I don’t really think she likes me, but that’s besides the point. I started tugging on my bf trying to get him to walk away with me, but he looked back and saw her, too, and waved.

445,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway because some other people know my main account.

A former neighbor of mine passed away. I grew up next to his family my entire young life. I was never super close with any of them, but my parents were close with the husband (the one who passed away) and wife. I now do some occasional contract work for their two sons, and I know their daughter in a more personal sense, but I wouldn't say I know her *well* exactly. However, the last few times I interacted with the daughter and her wife, we had some major blow-up arguments. Feelings were hurt on both sides; all of us were right/wrong in different ways. I apologized for my part of it, but they did not apologize for theirs, nor did they accept my apology. In fact, the daughter's wife asked that we never speak to each other again. (I thought this was unreasonable, but I went along with it for the sake of peace.)

When my neighbor died, I was sad. Though I didn't know him well, he was still a very sweet old man. However, I felt conflicted about attending the funeral. While it would have been a nice show of support for the wife and her sons, I didn't think I'd be missed much. Considering the rocky relationship with the daughter, I felt my presence might have added to her burden that day, and I didn't want that, nor did I wish to revive any of our arguments (her wife is pretty combative in nature, and I worried she would have started something). So, I decided to bow out of attending the funeral. Instead, I sent a nice note to the family, and I baked some cookies for the reception.

My dad and sister have been criticizing me for this. They think I was being childish, and that attending was a moral obligation. They feel like I was an asshole toward the grieving family.

447,AmItheAsshole,"Long story short, my boyfriend works at a tea shop where they have literally never paid their workers on time even once (it's always a day or two late). He, however, is an extremely positive person to the point that he can easily be seen as naive. He is a regular employee but they allow him to do manager work. For my boyfriend, it makes him feel like he is proving himself and bringing himself closer to a promotion. I personally feel this is the company taking advantage of his naivety. 

His boss mentioned giving him a share of the company's stock for all his hard work, which obviously made my boyfriend ecstatic and made him work harder. Meanwhile, his coworker's check bounced (she told me), and the boss openly joked about being in debt for opening the business and mentioned not making any profit. This is a new company that only opened 6 months ago. They passed their health inspection purely because my boyfriend handled everything, utilizing his knowledge as a former manager at a different joint. The owner had no idea what was needed to pass the inspection/what the requirements were. My boyfriend had to take matters into his own hands. Again, he is a normal, hourly-paid employee.

Today he was telling me about how he wants to research finances to point the boss in the right direction, in an effort to correct the untimely payments issue. This really upset me and I told him it is not his responsibility to teach his higher up how to pay his employees on time. This led to a larger conversation in which I calmly tried to tell my boyfriend he needs to drop his wishful thinking and forget all the sweet nothings they're feeding him, because the red flags are clearly there. He was very upset and told me I am just being pessimistic.

449,AmItheAsshole,"We have potlucks about monthly at my work. They're usually really fun, and a great way to end a workweek. The last one was one that I organized. People started bringing in their food, and I started to realize there wasn't much food compared to what we normally have. I was getting a little nervous because due to short staffing, people can't always take their lunch on time, and I was afraid those who brought food in wouldn't get any. I would be absolutely pissed if I contributed and ended up not getting any food. 

So then people, who I know for a fact didn't bring anything because they basically bragged about it, started coming and grabbing PLATES full of food. So I went to management and they approved for me to put up a sign that said ""Due to the limited amount of food, please be considerate of those who put time and money into the food for people to enjoy."". I put it on the breakroom door. I didn't feel it would be right to straight up stop someone from taking food but I did want them to consider some people spent money and took time out of their personal life to make the potluck nice. 

Well that rubbed people the wrong way and people(just those who didn't bring anything) started complaining. Saying it was rude to have a potluck at work that not everyone could join in. Since I was the one organizing it, I had people come to me beforehand saying they didn't know what to bring or didn't want to spend much money and I told everyone that ANY contribution was fine with me, whether it was a soda, forks, napkins I didn't care. I just thought it was fair that those who contributed got to participate. And for those who didn't, we've always had an ""unspoken rule"" that anyone could join in and take food, as long as those who did bring something got all they wanted first.

For some context, our bedroom window faces directly out onto the communal yard of our flatblock, with the back door to the building being right next to our window at a right-angle.

We were both chilling in our room, I was laying on the bed in a t-shirt and knickers, when we heard a knock at our window. Our blind was closed, but we assumed it was someone trying to get into the building so we ignored it, but they knocked a couple more times until my husband suddenly, to my shock and embarresmet, lifted the blind up to talk to whoever it was.

As we'd expected it was some man we didn't know asking for us to let him in.

I Was shocked and embarrassed, because as I said, was lying there with no pants on, and now there's some strange guys face peering in through the window, only about 4 metres tops away from me.

As my husband lifted the blind I tried to tell him not to, and was able to quickly pull the duvet over myself. I Hope I did it in time that the man didn't see anything, but even with the duvet covering me I still felt kinda vulnerable and embarrassed to have a stranger staring in at me in my bedroom like this. It's a pretty small room with a proportionately large window, (The window takes up just over half th wall space) so I felt a bit like a goldfish on display.

My husband had a short exchange with the guy of about 20-30 seconds, throughout which I was whispering through clenched teeth for him to close the blind. When he was finally done and the man had gone I started asking, 'Why did you do that?' At which point he suddenly burst into anger at me, and started ranting in an almost yell, asking why I have to always over-react/
Throw a fuss about things that don't matter (I Can't recall his exact wording)

At this point I felt a bit guilty and started questioning myself. I Am a very private, easily embarrassed, and somewhat prudish person. I Wonder if maybe this wssn't something I should've felt embarrassed or gotton annoyed about.

Now I look back, I wonder if it's really as bad as a thought in the moment. For one, I was able to lift the duvet over myself in time so I was covered, plus I was positioned behind my husband in a way that the man may not have even had a clear view of me, and also my husband was aswell himself just in a t-shirt and boxers, so was in the same postion as I was and if anything was exposing himself  even more than he was me.

453,AmItheAsshole,"TL:DR - Just moved to wife's home country for work. Wife's family don't understand why I don't want to deal with them on a work night, and wife is angry that I articulate my displeasure.

So, last week we moved to my wife's hometown in her country. I've accepted a job to work for the ruling family in management, so I have a high pressure job with a high demand. (I'm also working in my second language all day, so mentally is full on)

As my job is pretty high profile and demanding, I don't want to be social during the week, and I want kids in bed no later than 9 so I can relax and rest before work the next day. Weekends, not an issue and I fully and happily engage socially. This has led to some friction with my wife

Last week, we were invited to my wife's aunts bday. We had arrived the day before, and I was jet lagged and hadn't slept for 2 days. I really didn't want to go, but I went out of obligation. I asked my wife to make sure we left by 9, so I could sleep - it was so I would be able to work the next day. I was not social at all, and practically fell asleep. In addition, we didn't get to leave till almost 10.30, and kids couldn't settle, meaning I got 3 hours sleep. I was pissed off. Wife was angry at me for being direct about my displeasure.

Our things arrived on a truck two days ago, and we have boxes everywhere, and we just need to work out way through them. I really didn't want to have anyone visit until the weekend, as I wanted to make sure first impressions of our home were of a clean and tidy one. Yet last night, when I'm coming home, my wife informs me her mum, aunt and nephew came by unannounced and are at our messy place. My MIL said they had no choice as they were walking in the park in a 60mph blizzard and needed to go somewhere.... complete hogwash. Wife's aunt lives on the park, and we live at least a mile away. So it meant they had deliberately decided to come and nose at our place. I was pretty pissed off, as I'd been in board meetings all day and was just wanting to come home and relax. I made it clear I wasn't in the mood for social interaction - I wasn't rude, I said sorry I'm not chatty, I am exhausted after a long day and I need rest. I was pretty restrained until MIL told us how it was so hard to go out into the blizzard - and I shot back why on earth would you deliberately go out into such dangerous conditions, and that when I came home the snow and wind had calmed down. I had had enough, and I wanted to call her out on the BS.

So right now my wife is pissed off with me, as I have been clear that I do not want social interaction during the week, as well as wanting kids in bed at a reasonable time. She says that my relatives all think I am difficult now because I am too direct and clear on my expectations.  I don't care if it is Queen Elizabeth herself, I want boundaries, and decent night's sleep if I am working. I do like my wife's family, but someone has to be clear about respecting time and space.

454,AmItheAsshole,"Me and my husband have been married for 5 years. My MiL is a very nice, loving lady, who has never been anything but kind and welcoming to me, but she can be a bit... overbearing. Calling all the time, organizing dinners every weekend, big parties every holiday... she has never demanded I spend less time with my family in favor of my husband's, and we split holidays evenly and don't cut down on any visits with my family. Basically, she is sweet and respectful, but a tad too involved. I sometimes do wish I could have more free weekends and holidays to spend just with my husband, but I can live with this arrangement.

Anyway, around 6 months ago my youngest brother-in-law (husband's youngest brother) moved out, and my MiL started coming over to my house, letting herself in while me and hubby are at work, and doing our laundry, cleaning our house, and sometimes she even cooks dinner and leaves it in the fridge. Not every day, but a few times a week.

I know she is just being helpful. She has literally no intention other than helping us. Often she stays past the time we get home, we have some tea together and chat for some time, and then she goes back home. I have no problem with that and I enjoy her company, but I wish she'd just come over for tea. I know she's been feeling lonely since youngest BiL moved out, and we live the closest to her. However, I can't help but feel a bit... babied? Me and hubby can manage the household, we are not teenagers. I brought my discomfort up with my husband and he said he didn't see anything wrong with it, so I decided to suck it up.

Me and hubby have been thinking of trying for a baby. I told him I did not want MiL coming over to cook and clean anymore after we have our baby, and preferably starting IMMEDIATELY. We had a bit of a spat about it, but after I told him I wanted US to be the ones taking care of our baby, and I absolutely refused to have a child and have his mother coming into our house all the time like a 4th member of our nuclear family. I love her, but I want to enjoy my time with my nuclear family without her coming in all the time, and most importantly without feeling like someone else is taking care of my child. I want to take care of my child.

So the next time she came by (last Monday) I asked her, gently, to not drop in to clean and cook anymore. She agreed, but I could tell she felt deflated. I told her she was welcome to come by for tea and spend some time with me and hubby, anytime, but she left shortly after and hasn't come by for tea since, and hasn't said anything about dinner this weekend.

457,AmItheAsshole,"Last night I was hanging out with my friends. We were at a local restaurant where we were eating, drinking, chatting, joking around and pretty much having a good time overall. When it was the time for us to leave we asked for the bill and everybody except Jay (not his real name) placed their money on the table. Jay took the money, shuffled thought them, placed some of his own into the stack then placed the stack in that envelope the waitress brought us.

This is where I started being suspicious, because Jay has a habit of stealing things from stores, and this happens pretty frequently. And I know that he is my friend and I should trust him but I had a weird feeling about this, so the following conversation ensued:

$me - ''um Jay, can you please hand me the envelope?""

$Jay - ""why you're asking for it?""

$me - ""I just want to see if all the money is there""

$Jay - ""all the money is here, alright? I just counted it""

$me - ""look, I just want to make sure because I have a weird feeling about this""

$Jay - ""what are you implying?""

$me - ""nothing, but we all here know about your habbits""

458,AmItheAsshole,"This happened 15 years ago, but I've been reading AITA for a while, and this popped into my head.

I (16m) had to complete volunteer work for my school for a week. We could choose a school, nursing home, etc. I got to go back to my old elementary-middle school. Important for the story is that the point of us being there was to help, play, interact with the students. Us being students as well, this didn't seem strange at all. My brother (10m) was also at the school. 

Everything went really well for the first day. But on the second day I interacted with the music teacher (A Karen, probably 50). She saw me playing handball with the kids, walked up and huffed about how I can't do that and to get away from them. I was a bit thrown off, and apologised to the kids and walked away.

The next day a similar thing happened when I was kicking a soccer ball at lunch time with the kids. I told my old grade 7 teacher who was my advisor for the time what happened, and he told me to just ignore her.

Then the worst part happened. My brother, came up to me and kind of bumped me as a joke when we were on the school oval. She must have been following me, because she came up to me and yelled and screamed at me. At this stage, I lost it and told her to piss off, leave me alone and that I'll be reporting her behavior. We had a huge argument and I refused to back down.

I told my mom and somehow she got mad at me for wanting to report the teacher, and said that I should have just listened to the teacher. I obviously disagreed (and thinking as an adult, I still disagree. If it were my kid now, that teacher would be in real strife). I told the program coordinator, all my old teachers and the Principal (I knew him).

She obviously got in trouble because I continued to do what I was meant to do. She saw me but didn't say a word.

459,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway because I don’t wanna give away too much personal info on my main.

Background: I come from an upper class family and am an only child. My parents are super over protective of me and always look out for me but are overbearing at times. I’m a freshman at a good academic university which also has a good football team. My parents never let me play football or lacrosse in high school because it’s too rough according to them but they let me wrestle and I also ran track. (It doesn’t make sense to me either). I wrestled at 182 and I’m 6’ 1” so I’m not small by any means and I ran the 100m and 200m and was all state and all county respectively. 

I recently told my parents I wanted to walk on to the football team and they flipped out at me. They said it was too dangerous and that I will never be good at football because I come from a good family and I don’t have the need to push myself as hard as the other players. And that basically all the players are fighting for their future as opposed to mine which is set. If it was up to my parents, I’d graduate and then work at my dads company and then take over when he retires. 

I am grateful for everything they set me up with but I don’t wanna follow the path they paved for me and I want to make my own. And to me that starts with playing football. So WIBTA for walking on?",WIBTA for playing football (American) against my parents wishes?
460,AmItheAsshole,Last Friday I (30F)walked in on her and her new friend  and it was a sight I’ll never get out my head. And he’s super young I wouldn’t even see  a guy that age .  He’s younger then me what’s she thinking ?  and this kid might be the biggest doucebag I’ve ever met 100% srs . His picture should be in the dictionary.  I’m visibly upset and he just says “ your mama still got it (slaps her ass) you should go do some grown woman stuff and let her have fun” and she’s giggling and laughing . For years she refused to met anyone and this is the guy ?  It won’t even go anywhere . I call her today and I hear sports in the background (she doesn’t watch tv much less sports) and she’s too busy to talk so it’s pretty obvious he was over there .

461,AmItheAsshole,"My sister recently moved out. She wants me to come over to stay at her place. The problem with this is that the new apartment doesn’t have a dishwasher. I have over the years developed a rellay unclear phobia. I’m really scared of the germs on the different utensils and plates. I can’t feel that they are clean (even if you wash them by hand)if it isn’t in a dishwasher I trust?! I have to take hand washed bowls and all and put them into the dishwasher at home cause I still don’t feel like they are clean. Even if a bowl comes straight out of the dishwasher and has a tiny spot on it, I can’t help too feel the hole bowl is infected and have to run it thought the dishwasher again. The occasions I actually do drink and eat outside the house I have to wash them myself multiple times and then take boiling water and run it over the item. Despite that I still feel like they aren’t clean at all and have to force myself to use them.
It’s very unclear, but it’s a huge stress for me on a daily bases. 
Because she doesn’t have a dishwasher I am really stressed about staying over. She on the other hand now kinda feel like I’m just using this as an excuse to not stay over and she isn’t all too happy about it. The weird thing about this phobia is that it dosent always kick in when I’m at other places. For instance at our grandparents I don’t have a problem with it. Ofc I always have to check everything and feel a slight discomfort using the things. But I survive. 
Over the years we have also been staying over in our summer house where we have to hand wash everything and I’ve been able to use them items then. She uses this as an argument all the time and she uses the “what you don’t trust me?”. I try to explain to her that we haven’t been at the summer place for years now and places that do hand wash their things I still feel uncomfortable but I just try to repress it. Again her counter argument is “why can’t you do it when you’re at my place then?”.

I know it’s not on me that my phobia has gotten more sever the past few years, but the hole family is really starting to get mad at me at this point cause it’s ridiculous and not real?
She has lived there for a week and I’ve visited but just don’t want to stay for a longer period where a meal or any drink are involved. Said I would gladly come over if we get single use items. But again they all get pretty mad at me.

AITA for not wanting to go to her new apartment?

Edit: Thank you for all the kind comments&lt;3 I will try to seek help, kinda want too but I get extremely shamed by my hole family and they keep telling me off every time I even mentioning it and terrified over what they are going to make me do in therapy. But mainly the negative and very down putting responds I get. Plus kinda need the help of my partners to get a hold of a clinic cause they are still my legal guardians. Paper plates and plastic cups was the solution I came with that we agreed on. But more and more she is like “but you’re waisting nature” “but you can do it at other places” “no one has touched anything”. So either way I’m getting paint up as the asshole.",AITA for not wanting to visit my sisters new apartment cause she doesn’t have a dishwasher?
462,AmItheAsshole,"
I(21f) am one of the main support structures for my little brother(11). I live an hour away from him and my parents, as I am currently in college and working part time. My parents are dysfunctional to say the least. It’s not the healthiest of environments and my brother has developed some issues I think probably as a result.

He often comes to visit me to get away from home or I go home to try and diffuse situations sometimes or if he really needs me. Recently my parents called me while he was mid panic attack. I’m the only one who can really get him calm. He asked me to come home or to come get him. It was the middle of the week and classes just started so I couldn’t drop everything to go this time. 

The weekend was coming up though and I needed some documents from the house anyway so I said I’d probably see him then. I have a lot of anxiety around driving, usually I just suck it up, but this weekend my stress and anxiety is high because of classes starting and as such my insomnia and tendency to zone out has been pretty bad. I’m not the best driver like this. Also it’s snowing all weekend so the roads are horrible, and my car has been old and acting up. As such I really did not want to drive.

I asked if they would maybe drop him off to stay the weekend as he had a three day weekend and they said no. I offered to take the bus and that was also adamantly denied. I asked if they wanted to come stay in my city the weekend as my mother usually gets free rooms at the nearby casino hotel. Not ideal but it would get him here. Sadly they were all fully booked. Nothing was working so I told them reluctantly that I wasn’t comfortable driving this weekend and would probably have to find another time.

My dad then offered to come pick me up, which I guess started an argument between them with him saying he was getting me and her telling him no. He said he was coming anyway.

Now this morning, the day he’s coming to get me, my mother has called me a bunch saying he got off work late and wouldn’t have enough sleep and that if I loved him I wouldn’t make him come. Normally I just ignore her but I also don’t want to endanger my dad by making him drive if he’s tired. I know if I called and asked him he’d be adamant he’s fine and the few hours is enough but still I feel bad.

AITA if I still let my dad come pick me up even though he’s on less sleep?",AITA for letting one of my parents(who’s probably tired) drive 2 hours to pick me up for the weekend?
463,AmItheAsshole,"For this story it's important to know that I am a minor and I live with my parents, in general I am a pretty normal teenager. 

I came out as a lesbian to my dad recently, the circumstances kind of forced me to. 
His reaction was pretty bad. This itself didn't surprise me at all, because he has been openly homophobic ever since I can remember.

Long story short: He told me he would like me to go to conversion therapy and he can't force me to do it but that I should go voluntarily if I cared about him. Of course I said I won't go.
This made him go crazy. He started yelling at me and then said it's my own problem if I want to live as a *Russian slur for gay people* (No, I don't live in Russia, my dad is just Russian).

I then said, if he loved me he would not care about my sexuality because I am his daughter and he should love me no matter what.

He then said ""I don't love you anymore and I don't think I can ever again"".

This is about one and a half weeks ago and I haven't talked to him ever since.
Now even my brother and my mother who usually side with me, have called me ignorant and rude, but I said I want him to say that he's sorry, only then I am going to talk to him.

464,AmItheAsshole,"My sister (2 years older) has been a drug addict since we were like 16 and 18.  I didn't say anything cause at the time it was just weed and pills, I didn't want to snitch at her and we had a really good relationship back then.  But then she started to do worse and worse drugs, moved on from weed and pills to heroine and coke.  When we were 20 and 22 I didn't know but she took my credit card and was draining all my credit, she also stole about 5k worth of jewelry that had very very sentimental value to me.  I got a bill from the credit company and I had TERRIBLE credit score, I worked hard to not have bad credit score and had a decent car.  I had to give up that car and can barely drive a beater cause even now at 35 my credit score is still pretty bad cause I'm STILL paying everything off.  

When I found out what my sister did I was LIVID, I ripped into her calling her an addict and how she needs help and also how she's a stealing POS.  We had a big blow up fight over this and it took us over a year to talk to each other again.  When we did she was in pretty bad shape and I did feel bad for her but then she asked for 50k.......even if I had 50k to spare no way in hell would I give that to her.  She got really pissed and stole my wallet and tried to take a run with it.  I was able to get it back but after that I told her that I NEVER want to see her again.  

I have avoided her like the plague, she still uses but its a bit better from what my mom says.  Its just pills and heroine now and not coke.  So you know big improvement! (joking).  My mom was calling me basically asking for me to talk with my sister cause she misses me.  I kinda lost it and said ""I don't care if that fucking junkie misses me, I will NEVER see her again.""  My mom got really sad by that and said she wishes I would change my mind which I probably won't.  

My brother (who has always been one of my best friends and we've always been good), said that me calling our sister a ""fucking junkie"" was a bit too much and that I should reconsider cause even tho she's hurt me and she still uses she wants to ""reconcile"".

Backstory: So my bf and I have only been together for about 2 months and we still creating barriers and what we have insecurities about, he was added to a group chat on Snapchat called ""Dirty Group Chat"" I told him I didn't care at first because I really didn't until I saw pictures of naked girls or flirting going on that I was super uncomfortable with and when I told him he said ""trust me I'm not looking at any of them and they already know I'm taken"" I told him ""That's not the point, why even be in there when you know only the chick that added you?"" I hurt him at this stage but he knew I was right and I asked if I could send a message regarding his presence in the group chat and he was ok with it.

I basically just told them that I wasn't comfortable with my bf seeing naked chicks and that they shouldnt have invited him as he has a gf and I don't trust anyone in that chat. The creator of the chat(the chick that added him) said to me that I was controlling and that I shouldn't care what he looks at or who he talks to whether I trust the people on there or not. He got angry that she said I was controlling when in his eyes I'm not and blocked her and left those chats, although this was basically over I felt sad that I was responsible for my bf blocking a friend of his.

467,AmItheAsshole,"I’m gone a lot so my house sitter and I are pretty close. She’s a very sweet, hardworking woman. Last year I got her kids iPads for Christmas as a token of my appreciation. 

I told her before I bought them in case they already had them or she didn’t want her kids to have their own tablets or anything but she said it would be nice. 

I gave it to their mom to give them on Christmas (they said “from sockavenue”) but then I never heard about it again. No thank you note, no “they enjoyed them”, nothing like that. 

So this year I didn’t get them anything, because I had no way of knowing if they appreciated or enjoyed it. And it’s been awkward since I got back and it became evident I wasn’t going to. 

I mentioned all this to a friend of mine as I was trying to figure out how to proceed, and they basically said I’m an asshole for this. Because you should give gifts purely out of generosity and not make it contingent on gratitude.  

She also suggested there was something classist about my wanting them to say thank you or let me know they were enjoying them because I’m financially better off than they are so its condescending to expect a letter or call, let alone to stop getting them anything because I didn’t get a letter or call.

469,AmItheAsshole,"This happened last year.

In summer, in one of those boring nights that extend forever, I decided to create a discord server for playing a military simulator called Arma III (Similar to DnD in terms of player organisation). I put time and effort on creating an engaging experience for all the players that were involved in my sessions as I was the DM. There were a few rules that evolved as time went one, but one of them stayed consistent since the start:

 *"" Inviting friends to your own unit is a good way to get more members,* *but self promotion isn't allowed on this server**, invites will be removed following a warning. Direct messaging links to your server isn't allowed either, and will be punished as if you were doing so on the main channels.""*

Unexpectedly the server grew and grew. But I was losing myself in the process, and no longer enjoyed making sessions as my players didn't take things seriously and were fucking around most of the time. In a sale, one of my players and friends (CINEK), and my best friend in the unit, (FOX) bought me two expensive DLCs which compelled me to keep on making more sessions in order to repay them for those gifts despite me not wanting to keep going as I was very tired. 

At some point I was on the verge of collapse, I didn't enjoy making missions anymore and my players started noticing as the quality of the sessions and the rate at which we did them started declining, I still made sessions for my players even though I did not enjoy them.

In the end, one of my players, and my best friend in the unit, the same guy that gifted me one of those expensive DLCs (FOX) and another guy in the unit (WOLF) created their own group and started inviting people from mine to join theirs, I was unaware of that until (CINEK) told me as he was invited to the other group. At this point I was already mad at (FOX) for making fun of me on the sessions that we hosted. And the decision I made is something I still regret. I kicked them both from the unit after a very intense voicecall where I told them that I knew what they did and that I felt betrayed, which was true specially regarding (FOX) since we shared a lot of personal stuff",AITA for kicking one of my friends from my game group for betraying my trust?
470,AmItheAsshole,"I wont be able to sleep tonight just thinking about this situation and so I figured I may as well get some opinions to see if I am at fault for this. 

Some backstory: I have been talking and getting close to a girl for a few months now, we have gone out a few times and we enjoy each others company. We care about each other a lot. However we are not dating, Im not sure whether I am just not ready, if she isnt ready, or a mixture of both. I have never been in a serious relationship before and her previous one which ended right before we started talking a lot more and sharing feeling was slightly abusive. However, this is not a post about how to handle a relationship.

So here is what happened: Recently I have made poor life decisions and spent the entirety of last weekend either drunk and high, or hungover. Being drunk I have said some things to her about my feelings and how I view our relationship, which we have tried to keep as quiet as possible. Today during class one of my friends a teammates overheard her talking to a friend about me being an alcoholic and things I have said to her. Being my teammate a friend he instantly came to me about it as he was worried. Upon hearing that she was talking about my personal problems to someone who I dont know and telling them some of the things I have said I immediately got mad about it and started texting her asking why she would do that using some fairly vulgar language. She didnt respond for close to two hours so by that point I was fairly angry. I told her that I shouldnt have ever talked with her or told her about my personal life. She became apologetic and almost broke down in tears. After that I had to leave to go to a wrestling meet and didnt really talk with anyone other than teammates until it was over at about 10, so thats about 7 hours that I didnt talk to anyone. Upon opening my phone after the meet was over I had numerous texts from her apologizing, and many more from people telling me that I handled the situation badly and that I was an asshole for it. 

I pretty much have a good idea of what might be the verdict here but I wont be able to sleep so why not hear it from 3rd parties on as to what the verdict might be. So, AITA?",AITA for getting mad at someone for talking about my personal issues.
471,AmItheAsshole,"Literally happened half an hour ago.

Background: we've large dog and are currently looking after a friend's small dog  for a couple of days.

Our dog would normally eat dry food, the small one has his own wet, kinda jelly food.

We were all in the kitchen and my GF was feeding the dogs. Large one got his food from a measuring cup and she used a table spoon to break down the jelly for the small dog.

All good up to that point, we were standing, talking and then she reached out to the big dog to let him lick the spoon.

I think it's disgusting, dogs eat poop, lick eachothers balls etc. Since you don't boil the kitchen utensils or plates I would never give them to the dog to lick.

I've asked why she was doing this, but she was surprised I had issues with it and carried on letting the dog lick the spoon.

I raised my voice quite significantly, trying to make her stop with very little reaction other than *why are you speaking to my like that*

Anyway she claims she's been doing this all her life and it's completely normal to do with wet dog food.

I think it's disgusting because the dog will kick it clean and leave his thick saliva all over the thing which is hard to remove and gross.

She stopped in the end, after the dog was done pretty much, and reluctantly agreed not to do it again. I took the spoon and washed it. While doing this and noticing the thick saliva thing I swore under my breath. She heard it and went into the bathroom in a huff.

476,AmItheAsshole,"I work for a university chair that does research on power electronics. My colleague and I used to get along but he pulled some stuff that lead me to dislike him. At the moment it is my colleague, me and three other co-workers. 

We have two laboratories. The small lab is located on the same floor as our offices. The big one is two floors down. I am in charge of our big lab. This lab is equipped with power supplies that are hooked up to a testing device. It takes you about 3 minutes to get to the lab from our office and it's never been a problem in the past.

Last week, my colleague's student approached me and asked me if they could take one of the power supplies from my lab and put it in our small lab. I said that my colleague should ask me himself but I don't think it's necessary since you only have to walk down two flights of stairs. Either way students are not allowed to run tests by themselves so he needs to be there with the student at all times. 

The next day I needed to leave for an appointment. I was running a late when my colleague came and asked me if he could take the power supply from the big lab. He said that he needed the power supply in the small lab since he wouldn't get anything done if he had to walk to the big lab every time they had to run a test. Keep in mind these tests take some time so it's not like he has to get up every ten minutes to go to the lab. I told him that I don't see the necessity. He can do the tests downstairs just as well. Also I was afraid that the supply would be damaged during transport.  He started arguing with me and I ended the discussion by saying, ""I kindly ask you to leave the supply where it is"". 

Since the argument already annoyed me and I wanted to get a second opinion I talked to my other coworkers. They convinced me that it would be best let him take the power supply if he asked me. 

 
However since my colleague didn't ask me again I figured that he would leave it where it was.

Cut to today. I was grabbing a cup of coffee when my colleague's student approached me and told me that they were getting the supply and taking it up to the small lab. I got irritated and told the student that it annoyed me that my colleague didn't tell me himself. He had left earlier and wasn't around when the student informed me about their decision.

I didn't argue any further with the student but I was incredibly angry at my colleague because 

1. I had told him to leave it where it was and he went ahead and did it anyway. Why did he even bother asking me if he was going to do it either way?
2. He didn't tell me himself that he would be would ignore my request but had a student tell me.

I haven't talked to my colleague since and ranted to my other coworkers who seemed to be on my side. I however still am unsure wether or not I am rightfully angry at him.

477,AmItheAsshole,"Yes I know it sounds rude to begin with but let me explain before you make your judgment. I was basically raised, and still live with, by my father’s parents. That being said I am very close to them. My mother’s parents are very materialistic and try to play it off that they have so much money when in reality they can barely survive off of a pension because of their extensive spending. They are jealous because I am much closer to my other grandparents and constantly try to win me over with gifts and expensive days out. This tactic worked on all of my other cousins but not me which infuriates them to say the least. 

I think a factor that has contributed to this is the fact that they don’t have to “share” any of their other grandchildren. All my other cousins don’t have other grandparents and have lived with them for the majority of their life. 

Oh and the constant touching. I know that they were both abusive (physically, emotionally, verbally) toward my mother, aunts, and cousins. I was already disgusted with their materialistic mentality that when I discovered the abusive side of them I genuinely did not want to be around them, let alone be in their embrace. So I pull away from them, which has landed me multiple lectures and punishments from my parents.

As time has gone on their jealousy has become insane. Now instead of trying to win me over with money, they are guilt tripping me. I’m getting tired of the comments such as “You don’t even like us” “I don’t know why you like your other grandparents more” “Wow you don’t even like the gift” “I don’t know what to get you anymore since you dont like us, that’s why you don’t get any gifts”

It’s gotten to the point where i’m so fed up with their idea of showing off and their guilt trips that i’m tempted to just go with it and say “You know what you’re right, I do like my other grandparents more”

I’ve spoken to my cousins about this since we are the only ones that realise how rude, narcissistic, materialistic, and abusive these people are. Yet they keep telling me that I’m the asshole because they’re my grandparents and they deserve respect. Believe me I am very big on respecting people but I will not be respectful towards people who I feel don’t deserve it.

478,AmItheAsshole,"Me and a friend are part of a big group of college friends. We all talk via a group chat and via emails. There are subgroups and not everyone knows each other well, but for a while we invited everyone to our weddings and what not. Over the years we’ve had families and moved around, but try to take a yearly trip together.

So this year, I’ve been trying to plan a separate trip to Orlando for amusement parks, just girls no family. It’s been difficult to plan obvs cuz we all have jobs etc, and a couple tries fell thru. but one girl was going to be in Tampa for a family thing and said we can all go to her family thing and make a side trip to Orlando for fun and it seemed like the timing would work. 

The problem is she had invited the whole group to the thing in Tampa, but I only wanted the Orlando thing to be for people I knew to be super into the amusement parks. But one girl (we will call her V) already said she wanted to go to Tampa, but I do not want her there in Orlando. 

A little history... I’ve vacationed with her multiple times and she is very difficult. She makes people wait hours for her while she gets ready because she won’t wake up on time, she hogs the entire hotel room with her stuff, and is just really inconsiderate and selfish in general. For example, we go to an event where we have to wait in line early in order to attend - first come first served. She says she can’t wake up early so the rest of us all wait in line since 2 am to get a good spot. Then she finds us and snuck into line with us after she slept in until 9 am. None of us thought it was ok but I thought it was a fluke. But turns out she’s done this multiple times. A lot of us are noticing this trend in her behavior and are sick of it. We do all the work and she reaps the rewards, then bitches if we don’t allow her to take advantage.

So I asked my Tampa friend if we could exclude V from the Orlando trip. There are two of us that just can’t deal with her behavior anymore, and I don’t want to spend that much of my vacation time with someone who will ruin it for me. V already invited herself to another of my vacations, so that’s 2/3 of my PTO. My Tampa friend said to be nicer to V cuz she’s going thru a rough time, but her divorce was like 6 years ago and I don’t feel like I need to cater to her anymore, and tbh her “rough time” is created by her own actions and her exorbitant spending i.e. inviting herself to every single vacation anyone plans when she doesn’t have a job and won’t work. 

WIBTA for purposely not telling V the plans for the trip? Or should I just include her? i feel like an A, but do i need to suffer just cuz she might feel left out, esp after she refuses to acknowledge that her behavior is entitled at best?

479,AmItheAsshole,"This one has years of drama behind it, but I'm going to keep it as brief as I can. 

I'm almost 32 and have been bouncing between my parent's house and leaving the state ever since the end of high school. I've had stable jobs but they've all been pretty small, entry level jobs. Enough to keep me alive but not enough to really make a career out of. So my mother always insists I come back for a few months and try and get a job in the city. 

It's... awkward. Not because of my mom, I love her to death, but my dad is another story. I haven't respected him ever since I caught him on the phone with his mistress back when I was 18 and I don't think he's trusted me since. I never told my mother because it'd break her heart but I never looked at him the same way. 

He always jabs at me whenever he can, talking about how I can't hold a job and how I peaked in high school and all that. I won't pretend I don't give him shit in return but as far as I can see it, he usually starts it. 

When we aren't arguing he does try to get me a job. Although, when not trying to sell me on just working in his field, his ideas for jobs are kind of unrealistic, like calling on old family friends I barely know to ask for a job with them. When I shoot down his ideas, he gets angry and the cycle continues.

But this most recent visit is different, he's getting up there in age and it's clear he's not all the way there in the head. He spaces out a lot and his memory is spotty. This has only made him more aggressive towards me. However, my mother and other members of the family are saying I'm not treating him with due respect. Partly because they don't know what I know about his infidelity.

Am I being an asshole for not trying to be nicer to my dad? I feel like everyone in this house is starting to hate me but even if the old man's losing his mind I can't muster any sympathy for him. He's always breathing down my neck and reminding me of my failures even though I never called him out on his biggest.",AITA for not supporting my unfaithful father?

484,AmItheAsshole,"My boyfriend (20m) and I (20f) are currently living with his cousin. We plan to move into an apartment as soon as the landlord lets us know when one is ready, which should be some time next month. Our old apartment was foreclosed upon and we had to find somewhere to stay asap.

We originally stayed with his grandmother (75. I think.) However, we didn't realize the rules she had in place for unmarried couples: no shut doors, no sleeping in the same bed let alone room, no staying up late at night, no going to the barn alone together. She claims this is all because shes a Mormon, and in her home we should respect her and do as she does. 

I was grateful she let us come on such short notice, but I wasn't happy about the way she treated our relationship; almost like a joke, the way she spoke about it.

When I talked about maybe babysitting for extra money until I found a job, his grandma laughed and said, ""yes. Do that. That'll be great birth control and keep you and BF apart."" 

(She wants us to wait till marriage to have sex--ignoring the fact that we have been having sex since January 2019, which she knows, because we've been living together since then.)

A few days into staying with her, as busy as we were moving and looking for jobs, the rules got to be too much. I felt like I didn't even have a boyfriend anymore because of how little we were allowed to do.

His cousin (27m) then said, as long as we help watch his daugher sometimes and keep our room clean, we can stay in his spare room. He doesn't really have any rules and isn't home much due to work anyway.

My boyfriend's grandma then got incredibly upset and said we clearly didnt love her or respect her and had problems if we couldn't handle not having relations until marriage (which isn't even something we've discussed in great lengths.)

We were told the $86k was 90% of the on file home value and after an appraisal it would change. The new 90% is $140k after the improvements we've made. I only wanted to go to $100k for the amount to make sure all our debts are paid and in one location now. It raises the monthly payment back up to what we were originally quoted which was a little under $1,000. Its a lot, but we can do that and still make all the utility payments and have a food budget. Out of the loan our available funds left over would be around $14k. I suggested getting a nice mattress and paying my dad the money we owe him off the record.  That would leave between $7k - $10k depending on the deal we get for the mattress and the actual amount we owe my dad.

It wasn’t very often, as we live in a different state and my mom would want alone time with her grandchild when we visited. I am vehemently against him being there when my daughter is present because I don’t want my child to be around when the shit hits the fan. I don’t know his wife or what she’d be capable of doing if she found out her husband was being unfaithful. I told my mother my feelings about it and of course, she defended him tooth and nail. She eventually apologized but something tells me it wasn’t sincere. My family and I have since moved out of the country, so her married boyfriend is no longer a factor.

The thing is it has been 2 years, but they are still in constant communication with each other. They're always texting/snapping each other pictures and videos of the dogs. They meet up about 1-2 times a month to take both dogs to the park or on a hike together. They do a Christmas gift exchange thing for the dogs. They celebrate the anniversary of when they got the dogs, which they call ""Gotcha Day"" or something ridiculous.

Apparently, Nala was a birthday gift from her ex. So her birthday is also Nala's ""Gotcha Day"". Last year, she had a  backyard bbq get-together with her friends to celebrate, and of course Simba and her ex showed up. The whole thing is bizarre. It's like they have a child custody agreement but there's no child, just dogs!! 

I told her a few times that it makes me uncomfortable that she and her ex still spend so much time together.

So after making sure that I'm not a crazy jealous person, I asked my sister and gf's best friend to help me talk to her to see how ridiculous this is. We all went to brunch a few days ago and we sort of took turns saying our piece. Girlfriend got mad, called us bullies for ganging up on her, then stormed off.

494,AmItheAsshole,"Okay, so some background on this - I live in a small cul-de-sac where we are all a close-knit community. We help each other out whenever we can, and it's a very welcoming area.  
A few houses down, there's a family I'll call the Robinsons. The husband (Jeff) is an amazing guy who works on oil rigs around the world. His wife (Tanya) stays home with their two kids, I've never really liked her but we still talked.  
So anyway, a few months ago, Jeff went away on an oil rig and was going to be away for half a year. A month into his job, I began to notice that a man was visiting Tanya quite often. At first, I thought it was a relative of hers, so I just ignored it, but last week I came home from work to find a moving van outside their house.   
Now, neither Tanya or Jeff had ever said that they were moving, so now I was getting a bit suspicious, and it turns out I was right to be.  
While Jeff was away, Tanya had put all of his stuff into storage and moved the guy she was cheating with into the house (which Jeff owns), told her kids to call him their dad instead, and has called Jeff's parents to tell them to pick up his stuff from storage.  
Jeff came home yesterday to find his wife cheating on him, completely moved him out of his house and moved this other guy in, refusing to let Jeff see his kids, and had drained their shared bank account to the point there was less than £50 left. She had never even spoken to him about her being unhappy with the marriage, it all just came out of the blue.  
I was absolutely fuming. I was so pissed off with Tanya, I couldn't believe she would stoop so low. My husband and I let Jeff stay with me for the night while he tried to get things sorted out, and we'll let him stay until he manages to get his house back.  
I want to cut contact with Tanya completely. So, not helping her out by watching the kids (nothing against the kids of course), not helping her fox things or lend her equipment, not inviting her to any of the ladies' nights that are usually held at my house, etc. I just don't want to ever interact with her again.  
My husband says I'm overreacting and shouldn't cut her off completely and make her feel unwelcome because that isn't what we're like in the cul-de-sac. Obviously, Jeff feels the same as I do, and it looks like my other neighbours are split on the issue.  
I know it's not my business, but I think Tanya is a horrible person for doing this and I don't want to associate with her. It's up to my other neighbours if they want to react at all, but this is what I want to do. WIBTA if I did this?",WIBTA for cutting contact with one of my neighbours?
495,AmItheAsshole,"I (18) go to university and live on campus in a residence hall. My room style is called a “suite”- two bedrooms, a shared bathroom, and a small kitchenette and common area. It’s not big, and walls are kind of thin. 

The unit next to mine has two boys who seem to have little to no regard for others. It’s 2:30 in the morning and they’ve been screaming both in their unit and in the hallways with their friends and blasting music for a couple hours. I have an assignment for the course I’m majoring in due soon, and it’s a huge distraction. They’re also smoking weed, and the hallway STINKS of it. They had upwards of 10 people over throughout the night, and it was insanely loud. I was in my bedroom with the door to the unit closed and could hear conversations loudly. It’s becoming a pattern of disrespect. My roommate and I like to have people over and drink, too, but we’re never this loud or obnoxious. It’s also worthy to point out that these boys have been written up by others a few times, so they have a reputation for this. 

I called in a noise complaint to the service desk and some residence assistants came and asked them to keep it down. (My res tries to enforce quiet hours and they begin at 11pm on weekdays.) I was happy and figured I could finally get some sleep, but I heard one of the guys tell the RA that it was his birthday and they were just celebrating. I felt pretty bad after hearing that. They weren’t written up, but I kind of felt like a put a damper on their fun which isn’t cool. I’m not a killjoy by any means, it’s just a school night, and they were screaming three and a half hours after quiet hours began, and I’m sure others in my res hall were trying to sleep, too.

496,AmItheAsshole,"So first of all I’d like to stress that the bikini is cheeky NOT a thong. (Ladies probably get me, but guys might want to google). 

Anywho - I generally don’t like being stared at while nude. I don’t want to be stared at while I’m just trying to change and I certainly don’t want to walk around the house in my underwear. 

My bf and I occasionally shower together and that’s fine, and obviously I take my clothes off when we have sex. 

But I don’t like to just be nude for the sake of it, and I don’t want to be stared at. Nothing against my bf - I’m just not comfortable with it. 

However, bf has this thing where he wants me to let him..... stare (?) at me while naked (at random times..) particularly my ass. 

This makes me especially uncomfortable because he’s the type to kind of blurt things out, and there have been many occasions where he’s pointed out things about my appearance. Not in a malicious way... but in a way that most people with emotional intelligence just wouldn’t. 

For example we were sitting and eating dinner one night and my legs were crossed, and he randomly decided to point at my leg and say “look! Cellulite!”  (Edit: he apparently thought it was funny?) 

So obviously the idea of showing him my bare ass in bright light is especially unappealing. 

But then he’s annoyed because I’m comfortable walking around in a cheeky bikini on the beach.

So I go to my partner's house with said gifts for her to give to them as I won't see them. All good, or so I thought. I then get a message recently saying that she can't find them anywhere and she's looked all over. She then adds to the message saying ""Never give cards"" ""Always print outs. They can be printed again"" followed up with ""Future reference, no cards"". She apologises for losing them, but I still feel like this shouldn't have happened.

I never asked for any kind of compensation, figured I'd be doing it as a gift/favor for my parents. Relevant notes here: The house I own is across the street and a few houses down from my parent's house, I can literally look outside and see their house. I do petsit as a ""side hustle"", I usually charge $100 per dog and $80 per cat for one week; 7 days, Monday to Sunday for example. My parents know I do this and know my prices.

I'd bring the dogs to my house, and stop in one or two times a day to check on their house, and feed the cat, etc. I remind my dad that I work long days (12 to 14 hours, Monday-Thursday) and have a dog-walker to come and walk/play with my two dogs on days that I work, So He'll have to pay for his dogs. My Mom is home with their dogs all day, so they don't have a ""potty schedule"" like my dogs do. We agree on everything and go about our lives. 

So last Friday they leave on their trip, I go over and pick up the dogs, take them home and spend the weekend with all 4 dogs.  Everything goes fine, and my parents come home yesterday (Thursday) afternoon.  I was still at work when my dad called to tell me they were home, and I let him know that I'd be leaving in an hour and I could bring the dogs over when I got home, or he/mom could come to get them.  He said they'd get the dogs after they had dinner. 

When they came over the get the dogs, I told my dad how much he owed me for the dog walker, ($10 per dog per day, so 2 dogs for 4 days is $80)  And he said: ""I thought you were watching them as a favor?""  When I reminded him that I had told him, when we set everything up before the trip, that he'd have to pay for his dogs to go with the dog walker, he said that he hadn't agreed to have them walked.   So I told him He could pay me my standard petsitting fee of $280, or give me the $80 for the dog walker.

501,AmItheAsshole,"Backstory: I am a former anorexic, in recovery for about a year. The friend in question has always had issues with her weight, showing what I percieve to be disordered eating habits.

So, onto the story. About a month ago, my friend, let's call her F, approached me at school and started enthousiastically talking to me about a youtuber she found that was doing anorexia recovery videos. Specifically, she liked one type of challenge, where the youtuber in question made another person dictate what they ate for a day in order to break their food rules (if you didn't know, some eating disorder sufferers have certain food rules, for example not eating bananas or sweets).

She proposed loudly that I do the challenge on monday next week. I was obviously uncomfortabe by the situation, especially since most people at school don't know I was anorexic, and I would very much prefer that it stays that way. She then immediately continued by asking me about my food rules in a very evasive ""tell me all about it"" way, to which I hadn't consented. Thankfully, I was saved by the bell. 

Fast forward a few weeks, where me and some friends were gathered up in an event where F couldn't make it. We started talking about F's habits, stating that we are worried. I brought up the conversation we had about The Challenge TM, and how I thought it was not only unnecessary, but also detrimental to my own recovery, which is mostly based upon me taking things slow and doing everything in order to prevent my inner anorexic from freaking out (for example, I went from absolutely despising bananas and milk to drinking banana smothies almost daily. It took me half a year). I also mentioned her being insensitive to my recovery and projecting her own issues upon me. Some examlpes are F saying that she's not eating something I'm eating because it has too many calories, her talking about weight and dieting etc, all of which I have explicitly told her to avoid mentioning in front of me.
Long story short, my friends said that I should confront her about it.

Fast forward to yesterday. We were talking about an unrelated topic when the following exchange took place:

F: ""Don't you think I've forgot it""

Me: ""What?""

F:""The food rules challenge""

Me, starting to look distressed: ""oh, ermm..""

F: ""You need to be very open with me. Tell me all your food rules, right now""

Me, in very visible distress: ""I think that it's not a good idea, I don't really want to do it""

F: ""We're doing this, whether you want it or not""

I made a quick excuse and left. I'm honestly lost here. On one hand, I really think I should confront her about her behaviour, especially since she doesn't see how much it hurts me. On the other hand, if I did that, I'd feel like an asshole who is dictating whether people have the right to express their own negative image just because it makes me uncomfortable.

So reddit, please tell me. WIBTA?",WIBTA if I confronted a friend for being detrimental to my recovery?
502,AmItheAsshole,"Exactly as the title suggests. Years ago, my friend had trouble finding work and asked me if I could use the current company I worked at as a job reference. I handle the calls, so I did him a favor and allowed him to use my company as a reference. Even though I know he never worked at my employment, I figured I needed to help a friend out. They actually did call, and I left a stunning review of my friend. He got the job later that week.

Now years later, I am in a similar bubble. I left my previous employer due to sexual harassment, so I clearly do not have any recommendation letters to get from them. So naturally, I ask my friend. 

Turns out, he's nervous that he might mess up when they call and get himself in trouble. So he declined. I casually remind him that I had helped him out those years ago, and if he could return the favor, I would really appreciate it.

He flips, saying that shit is not cool. He is now very mad at me for hanging stuff over his head from years ago and that I am being an asshole about it. Please note, I literally never once brought this up before to him. I could understand if I constantly remind him about it, but I've never mentioned anything about helping him until today.

504,AmItheAsshole,"My fiancée and I were good friends for a long time before we dated. A few years before we started going out she confided in me that she was having feelings for a coworker, but the catch is that he’s married. She grappled with those feelings because she knew it was wrong but it was hard to stay away because spending time with him even just at the office made her happy. 

Personally I thought that her coworker wasn’t all that innocent because he was doing things that I didn’t think ‘just a coworker’ would do for someone. If my fiancee mentioned that she wanted to eat a certain food he would bring some to the office the next day. He had a playlist of all the foreign language songs she liked and played it whenever they car pooled. At one company event he looked for her among several hundred people just to give her his jacket when one of their coworkers mentioned that the AC at the venue was so cold that my fiancée told her she felt chilly even though she was wearing a long sleeved dress.  

My fiancée pushed herself to date other people when she felt strongly enough for him that she would have an affair with him if he made a move. She dated three guys in two years before things sort of led us together and we eventually became a couple. 

By the time we started dating her coworker was no longer an issue because she said and I saw that she was over him when she started dating the guy before me. She said she realized that what she loved was the feeling of being wanted that her coworker made her feel and not her coworker himself. She continued to be good friends him and she said he never did anything that crossed a line. 

Now that we are getting married my fiancée wants to invite her coworker but it’s not something that I want to do if I can help it. I don’t doubt my fiancée but I’m not comfortable with the idea that one of our wedding guests is a guy she would have thrown her morality to the wind for if he’d asked, and I believe it would've been just a matter of time before he did if my fiancee hadn't done anything to remove herself from that situation. 

My fiancée says that she is inviting all her coworkers so if she leaves him out it will raise questions and put her in an awkward spot. I suggested just inviting them including the coworker in question to the after party but she didn't want to do that either because her other coworkers who got married earlier invited us to both the ceremony and the after party.

Some backstory: my mom recently has been getting involved with my younger cousins (1 &amp; 3 years younger than me) and their preparation for college. It is important to note that I have yet to go to college and this year is my junior year (11th grade).

Today was my birthday, and my aunt (mom's younger sister), uncle, and cousins came over to celebrate. Since my mom has been helping them with what my cousins should do to go to a good college, somehow the conversation strayed to some recommendations that my mom gave.

I totally get that my mom wants to get my cousins into a good college. Like, I hope they do too, but sometimes I feel like she's prioritizing them above me. I've been trying to tell her that a few times, but she brushed it off.

I finally snapped after my aunt and her family left. I've said something along the lines of ""Can't you stop talking about my cousins and their education for once? It's my birthday."" My mom responded that then I should think about what subjects not to talk on her birthday.

I can see that I could have probably worded my feelings better, but I'm tired of hearing about my cousins.

507,AmItheAsshole,"So basically my girlfriend and I got an Airbnb with two of our friends (who are dating) to stay over after a concert we all went too. We all split the cost so it came to around $50 per person.

There was only one room and a sofa bed mentioned on the Airbnb posting. My girlfriend and I see each other more often than this other couple does, so knowing this, we decided beforehand to let them have the room so they could enjoy the time that they got together. 

As we get to the Airbnb, we find out that the “sofa bed” is actually just a foldable couch (just searched it up &amp; it’s called a Granby Twin Convertible Sofa).
It was very small and uncomfortable, the boyfriend of the other couple couldn’t fit on it without his feet hanging off. Luckily, my girlfriend and I were smaller so we just sucked it up. 

We come back from the concert, getting ready for bed and come to find out the Airbnb host provided a small THIN “blanket” for the sofa bed. Again, my girlfriend and I are small people but it wasn’t big enough for both of us. I ended up having to sleep with both our winter jackets and let my girlfriend have the blanket. 

The morning after, my girlfriend and I decided to file a complaint to Airbnb for a refund. However, that’s where the issue starts. As the boyfriend of the other couple (we’ll call him Friend A) booked it, we had to ask him to file the complaint for us. I tried going through a process where he could simply tell Airbnb that I had his consent to file the complaint for him, as to not bother him, but he couldn’t figure that out, so he ended up doing it. The complaint Friend A typed out literally states that the requested refund is for the lack of accommodation for the sofa bed. The next day, the Airbnb hosts accepts his fault and provides us with a refund of $100. 

Friend A then texts my girlfriend and tells her he’ll e transfer every one 25$ each once Airbnb gives it to him. We were super confused because we had no idea why he thought the refund was for him and his girlfriend too. The whole time we had assumed that it was for us as we were the ones who even made the effort to actually make a complaint and it was us who had the bad experience while they enjoyed their comfy bed and room. We had to argue with him as he believed him and his girlfriend were entitled to half of the refund as we all booked it together and that’s how we can be fair. He also said that even though he appreciated that we gave them the room, if we really hated it, we should have said something and made them switch. We didn’t even want to make a big deal so we asked for just $75 instead of the full $100, for the inconvenience he went through to have to file a complaint.

Long story short Friend A gives us the full refund, but does so while acting very condescending as if he was being the bigger person about it.  To this day, this interaction baffles me because I don’t see any logic in his argument",AITA for asking for a full refund?

AITA to cancel my last three physical therapy appointments because some people think that I stink?

I have had 19 appointments with a physical therapist who sent me an email this evening stating that she has a few patients who have difficulty being in the treatment room with me and after me due to the very strong cigarette smoke smell. 

She said some patients have told her that they will not return unless she can assure them that the cigarette smell will not continue to be a problem.

She says that it is also giving her headaches and a scratchy throat. She asked me if it would be possible for me to shower and change into fresh clothing just before my appointments and to then refrain from smoking until after the appointment.

To be clear, I shower, wash my hair, brush my teeth and put on clean clothes just before each and every appointment. 

My understanding is that nicotine can be absorbed through the skin and enter the bloodstream in the same way nicotine patches work to help smokers stop using cigarettes.

I have read that you will always smell like smoke for as long as you smoke and this will not resolve until your body clears these toxins from the inside. It doesn’t seem to matter how much you shower, wash your hair, wash clothes, use mouthwash, soap, shampoo, etc., or any other method.

511,AmItheAsshole,"This is from a while ago, but I always wondered if my husband and I were in the wrong about this particular situation. 

Last year we were renting one side of a duplex, the other side was lived in by the owner of the duplex. At some point, she had a friend of hers move in, rent free. Now, I have 2 small children, and at the time they were 2 years old and 5 months old, so babies. 

This woman ended up getting a job working at mcdonalds, usually the night shift, so she would be sleeping at weird hours of the day and night. My husband was a stay at home dad, and because of the weird daylight hours where I live (AK) my kids sleep schedule was pretty messed up. 

So one night, about 8:30 - 9 this woman bangs on my back door that was connected to the laundry room, telling me that we need  to calm my 2 year old down(the running around was vibrating their side of the house). Ok, thats fairly reasonable so we said sure, well try to keep them from stomping around. Apart from a stomp here and there, the kids were quiet. No crying from the little one or anything

A few days later on a Saturday at 11 in the morning, this lady does the same thing. ""You need to stop him from running around so I can sleep"". I straight up told her to fuck off, and that I wasn't willing to sit him front of the tv for however long she needed to sleep for. Its 11 in the freaking morning, and winter in AK. So he really had nowhere else to get his energy out, and I wasn't comfortable with him watching hours and hours of tv. She threw a fit, talking about how we needed to be respectful of her hours, and how she would tell my landlord, who would evict us. I laughed in her face and told her that I very highly doubted she would even be mad at us, and that I would not silence my kids at the place I pay to be, at a normal time of day. I didn't even attempt to quiet them down.

She did this a couple more times, all between 11am and 4pm and I told her I would only keep them quiet during the times I was required by law to not be invasive (10 PM to 7AM I think)

512,AmItheAsshole,"Alright, so: one of my good friends (and ex-room mates) is in a pretty terrible relationship with one of my girlfriend's best friends. It's evident that they just really dont actually like each other/ fight constantly/ threaten breakups/ you get it.

So, a couple nights ago, my current roommate and friend gets a string of texts from him. The texts detail how him and his girlfriend are done, she broke up with him, and he needs to crash at our place. He tells me (I think naturally, because he asked to stay at my house).

My girlfriend is good friends with his now ex, so I text her to get her to talk to his girlfriend because I thought that's what people who have friends on both sides do (and now I'm questioning if this was the right choice or not, and if this step makes me TA)

So my buddy doesn't come over the next two days, says they're working things out (never to me, he's not answering my texts) and my girlfriend goes to hang out with his SO.

She asks her what's up and she is confused, she presses further and she gets even more confused.

This year, it’s my turn to get married, and my fiance and I are tying the knot in March. We’re having a small wedding for financial reasons, and our venue can only fit 50 people max, which includes us, our officiant, and our photographer. After all of our families, we had room for 10 more people, so my fiance and I each invited our closest friends and their partners. I’ve known these friends for significantly longer than I’ve known Abby (20-plus years versus 8 years).

I told Abby when I started wedding planning that we were having a very small wedding and no bridesmaids/groomsmen, and she seemed a bit disappointed but said she understood. But out of the blue, she sent me a very upset Facebook message this morning saying that she knew I had invited other friends and that she felt hurt and betrayed.

I don’t feel like I was dishonest with her, though. I never said that I wasn’t inviting any other friends, just that we were keeping it small. I would obviously have preferred to invite more friends, but we just don’t have the money to do that (and wouldn’t be able to anyway, because of the venue limitations).

514,AmItheAsshole,"This happened just yesterday and was hoping to get some opinions on this.


I have only recently moved into this house with about 4 other people. More of a flat-share arrangement where none of the others had particular ties to each other. This one roommate in particular has always seemed to be dissatisfied with the cleanliness of the kitchen/use of communal areas by others, and since my arrival back in September, has assumed that anything not done right such as leaving dishes in the sink, is my fault. She would frequently leave hastily written, passive aggressive notes plastered around the kitchen and when we discussed these, she would mention directly that ""everyone else says it's not them and you're new so it must be you as you're the recent change"".

I guess it's important to point out at this point that I always have cleaned up after myself and not left the kitchen in any state that she mentions in these notes. Full disclaimer, I typically throw these away immediately after seeing them. This went on for a while longer with her un-signed notes while she has simultaneously refused to ever remove her hair from the sink of the showers, causing blockages despite requests from the landlord. It's always clear she is the author of the notes.

The final straw for me was the other day when I walked into the kitchen where a note was left, this time written on a page ripped from my notebook I leave in the kitchen for my studies, held down by two of my own mugs on the counter, saying ""the cleaner only comes once a week, it is not acceptable to leave dishes in the sink as we all have to live together"".

I concede these two mugs were not left in the same place as the typical drying dishes and were instead behind the sink, but the way she left it was quite a messy sight c fact she used all my own property, as well as open my book and take a page to write this sent the signal to me that this was aimed specifically at me despite no-one being specifically named.

My response to this involved writing a note myself to replace hers saying ""if you are going to write your shitty notes and leave them around, please use your own property rather than mine. -(my name) :)""

Later in the day, she knocked on my room door and asked if I wrote it. I said that I did and she said that it's incredibly rude and was wondering why I got so defensive, clearly showing that I'm at fault. I told her it was not the content of the note I was unhappy with but rather the fact she took my own pages from my book and my cups to write this out. She was clearly quite upset about this, as well as my sarcastic ""goodnight"". This happened in the corridor surrounding our room and I am unaware of the opinions of anyone else in the house except I know others aren't too happy with the constant notes laid around.

Did I go too far with this, or am I perhaps justified in my decisions? I'm slightly conflicted myself, but generally sick of the constant passive aggressive notes.

515,AmItheAsshole,"I just moved and I was getting internet and cable set up at my apartment today. I’m a woman and live alone. The guy was hooking up all of the wiring or whatever. It was taking a while. Eventually he finished and asked if he could use my bathroom. I said no but he could ask downstairs if there’s a bathroom the maintenance people use. (I really didn’t know if there was one or not). 

My reasoning is that: (1) I am somewhat germapobic and had no way of knowing what he was going to do in there; and (2) I have certain personal items in the bathroom, like every other woman. 

So the guy goes downstairs, comes back up and says there is no publicly available bathroom and asks to use mine again. I said no and that he could try a 7-11 (which is a few blocks away). He says he’s not going to make it. I said, well, you’re a guy, there’s always the bushes if it’s urgent? (I said it more politely, but that was the jist of it).

Right away I picked out this man right away as “that person”. You know the one person on the trip that’s just annoying and you avoid at all costs. 

All this man does in complain  (“I would have just rather had ice cream” (for for lunch one day when we were given an Indian dessert) or making stupid comments (our tour guide said we were heading to the hotel and the man asked “our hotel?”). He’s also that person that gets in the way of your pictures, is always pushing passed you and is never aware of his surroundings. 

I have been making sure to stay as far away from this man and his SO as possible. This morning my brother (who I’m travelling with) and I went down to breakfast. It was buffet style  but we were still seated. Despite being just us two we were seated at a table for 4. We started getting food and sat down.

They never really asked me questions or addressed me but my mom kept referencing me a bit in conversation and by the things she was saying expected me to carry the conversation on and add in to things she was saying.

517,AmItheAsshole,"I live in a house that has been made into two apartments. My boyfriend and I have lived in the front apartment since last July. It has both an upstairs and downstairs. Our neighbor has only a downstairs and she has lived here for 4 years.

Our landlord mentioned when we moved in that she was a ""complainer."" We weren't worried as we are polite and relatively quiet. I had a party soon after we moved in, which I talked to her about before-hand and gave her my number in case we were too loud. She texted me around midnight and we had a pleasant exchange. She further explained she can't hear the TV and she can't hear voices but she can hear the doors, floors, music with bass, and especially the stairs.

Since this I have received texts, usually between 10-11pm and after I've used the stairs or someone has closed the door to use the downstairs bathroom, asking me to ""please have some consideration"" about the ""thumping and banging of the floors."" I asked my boyfriend and he says that I'm kind of a heavy walker, but it's nothing I do on purpose.

Tonight I received the following text: 
Sam your thumping and banging through the house is rude and annoying..waking me up is rude and annoying..not being able to go back to sleep listening to you walk around on your heels and scrape your metal chairs across the tile floor also rude and annoying...stop being rude and annoying!

I would like to make it clear that we don't have metal chairs, but I did probably move one of our wooden stools earlier after I made our lunches.

She completely ignores how I feel about any situation, and when she screams at me and tells me I’m a waste of space, she says she tells me that because she loves me. So earlier, I asked her why she doesn’t treat me like a daughter. I asked her if she actually meant everything she said, and when she said no, I went on a tangent about why that’s not the correct way to parent.

521,AmItheAsshole,"I've been the sole babysitter for a friend since their child was born 3 years ago. I don't get paid supremely well, below minimum wage ($60/6hr when minimum would be $84/6hr) but it's still been agreeable because it's easy money and I can study while I'm there. My friend is also not particularly well off (or wasn't as you'll soon read) so I was throwing them a bone by being lenient on the wage. The husband is against babysitting and daycares (he was a victim of abuse this way) but he agreed because we're all friends and have been for a long time.

My friend won $740,000 in the lottery two months ago and everything is more or less settled in. They bought two new 2019 cars ($60,000+ vehicles), travelled a bit, etc. But they still paid me the same amount, which stung because I'm covering for them while they went to Cuba and Mexico.

They can afford to pay me more, so I told them this. I want minimum wage, and they declined saying it's too expensive. So I decided to no longer babysit for them. This means they'll have no babysitter because my friend's husband doesn't care for them.

I know I'm not the asshole for quitting over a wage but it's not entirely that. I'm half doing this vindictively because I know they're in a peculiar position where I'm their only option. But all I want is minimum wage, I'm not going to gouge them over this fact.

523,AmItheAsshole,"This happened a year ago but it was brought up recently by a friend who was in the class with me. I knew my classmates thought I was an asshole about this but I didn't agree, but the fact that she brought it up after so long is making me second guess myself. 

I was taking a graduate level course in a clinical psychology program and the allotted time for our final was 2 hours. I have pretty severe ADD but I manage it okay. In the past I've gone through the trouble of getting formal accommodations, which usually includes special note taking, additional time with the professors, and most importantly, double time for tests. But I don't really like getting special treatment and for these courses I had been doing fine with the regular amount of time on tests, so I hadn't bothered going through the disability process.

Given the preparation and sample exams I knew 2 hours would be enough for me. But the day before the final, the professor just kind of offhandedly said that we shouldn't need 2 hours so he was just giving us 1. His reasoning was that then we could all get out of the semester a bit early, which everyone else in the class was excited about. 

I did panic a little bit and said right away that that isn't right, especially just telling us the day before. However I wasn't rude or demanding (at least I don't think I was), just anxious and sort of shocked. He was dismissive and just told me to deal with it. Later I went to his office to reiterate my position and remind him about my ADD issue (I'd already told him and the other teachers just in case it ever came up), and he just said that it was my fault for not getting the accommodations. I responded saying that I would have if I'd known this was a possibility, but 1 day wasn't enough time to get it set up. He got pretty irritated with me and just told me to suck it up, the real world doesn't always accommodate our needs.

In the end I did okay on the test but not as well at I could have since I was stressed and rushed. Am I the asshole here? I realize it is ultimately my fault for not getting the accommodation, but I thought it was unreasonable the way this happened, and I didn't think that asking him to abide by the scheduled time was a crazy request. It's especially shocking considering this was a clinical psych program and I would expect them to be more aware of the gravity of the problem. My classmates were thrilled to get to leave early and were irritated that I might throw a wrench in that.

For some background, there’s a girl on the marketing team who assigned me a project where I had to stay in the office from 9 AM to 8 PM for two days straight. The presentation isn’t until next Thursday but this girl was asking for it a week before the deadline. 

I showed the project to my boss today. When she saw that I made 128 renders in less than two days, she said “This is absurd that they asked you to make so many renders! They will only pick six out of those 128 renders for their project to show to the client.” She said she will talk to the head of marketing to prevent these kind of crazy requests in the future.

Now, that's the part that I'm ok with but the reason I don't want a cat to be here is that it will likely die. In our neighbourhood everyone has big dogs who are almost always hostile to cats. Furthermore in front of my house a car usually passes every 10 seconds.

They have breakfast together every single morning. His mom and her partner will get up at 6am, put breakfast things out on the table, and wait for us to get up at 8-9ish. If they can’t wait, they eat and then come back to the table to sit with us while we have our breakfasts and boy are they chatty. 

My family tends to have the view that everyone gets up and gets their own breakfast on their own schedule, since everyone gets up at different times. Same thing with lunch, except if we’re all ready for lunch at the same time (my boyfriend’s family will again all sit down for lunch together every day).

Over Christmas, I felt really worn out from the constant socializing and feeling like I had no time to myself, and a lot of that was having to go straight into socializing when I woke up. I said this to my boyfriend, and he suggested taking my breakfast somewhere else in the house and eating alone.

I personally would feel like a huuuge asshole going into the kitchen, making my toast and coffee, and then being like “sorry guys, I don’t actually want to talk to you!” and leaving. 

He says it would be fine and everyone would understand, but I don’t 100% trust his judgment on this. He’ll often be on the iPad at breakfast with his family, and his mom has made lots of comments about how rude it is and how she thought we were having breakfast together. Or he will be on his phone during a family dinner or if he’s checked out of a conversation. He’s gotten a lot better about it since I’ve started pointing it out, but I don’t think he has the best read on what other people find rude. 

So, would I be the asshole if I got my breakfast and went back into my room to eat it, or should I suck it up and deal with it?",WIBTA if I don’t have breakfast with my boyfriend’s family?

My 22 f cousin Milly 28 f is getting married in 2 month's time.


Milly has brown hair to around the middle of her back but wanted her hair longer for her wedding day.
She was originally going to use clip in extensions but as I'm currently training to be a hair dresser I advised something longer term so she has them for her honeymoon.

Milly agreed this was a good idea, the only setback was the cost, after doing some research i decided nano extensions would be best and found a local salon but they charged $1450 !! 

So as I already have alot of hair knowledge I put this offer to Milly. 
I said I would order some extensions offline and fit them for her for half the cost of the salon, I found some gorgeous extensions that cost $600 so that's what we did.


So 2 days ago the hair arrived, Milly was ecstatic the hair was fantastic quality and the exact same that the salon uses called beauty works. 

I decided to do them for her the day they arrived,  around 1 hour in I was already really struggling, you have to use a little clamp over and over and it HURTS. 
But I powered on and finished the whole set and it looked amazing.
Milly was super happy with them at the time.


And then it all went to shit, the next day milly calls me absolutely freaking out saying there's something wrong with the extensions,  I go straight to her house and it's bedlam. 

Her hair looks horrificly matted and weirdly greasy, I ask her what she did to it but she said nothing,  she just slept on it with it tied back, wich is hard to believe as it looked amazing when I did it.

I set to work combing it out and as I start to pull the brush through the individual extension strands just start slipping down the hair and coming out. 

I read that this can happen and to expect to lose a few but after around 15 had fallen out Milly asked me to stop because she was in pain.

A weird goo was all throughout her hair, it was sticky and what was clearly causing the matting.
So Milly decided to get an urgent appointment at her local salon wich she was lucky to get although i was quite insulted that she didnt give me more time to see what what had gone wrong.

Later that day Milly turns up at my house and my jaw all but hit the floor because she had a pixie cut.
She came storming over hysterical telling me the salon said I used the wrong kind of bonding glue and that I shouldn't have been using glue at all for the extension method I was using. 

That is 100% bs as i watched tutorials before I did her hair,  as the wedding is in just a few week's Milly won't be able to grow her hair, so she and her fiancee have asked that I pay for a good quality wig for the wedding day and general use.

I don't think I should have to do this!  I followed the tutorials and seriously don't know what went wrong I did this to help her and now she's asking I pay an insane amount on a wig  AITA",AITA for refusing to pay $1300 on a wig for my cousin's wedding after a slight mishap with hair extensions?

I sent a smiling detective pikachu sticker which says “how about you go fuck yourself”, he then cursed me out and kicked me out the group. I know it’s silly, but I’m curious.",AITA for making my friend mad and sad?
534,AmItheAsshole,"This was going to be a throwaway but I like it so I’m keeping it. 

Simply, I have three younger brothers, all of whom are on the autism spectrum, and one is also celiac. I have been vegan since before my last birthday (I’m currently 25F), but while my family had a cake, I ate a bunch of strawberries.

This year I found a baker who makes the most amazing vegan and celiac friendly ice cream cake. They are local, and are fire affected.  (I’m an Australian) they didn’t loose their bakery, but they’ve lost a lot of business. So I decided to buy one for my birthday, even though it cost a lot more than I would normally spend. Usually I have a $10 cake from the local shops. 

I told my family (group chat) and my celiac brother immediately was excited to be able to be included (he was diagnosed after my last birthday). My mum said that my other brothers won’t eat it, and I said it’s fine, I was going to them some muffins or donuts (they love donuts) in case they didn’t want to try it. Although they struggle to try new foods, as is common with ASD, they have been more willing to make attempts as they’ve both gotten older. One recently got his first job, so they’ve been making big strides. My mum said I wasn’t being respectful of their needs. I explained again I wanted a cake that I would enjoy for my birthday, and I was getting things for them. 
All of my brothers read these messages. One sent a message that said ‘I like donuts’ and had a picture of a donut. I sent one with a gif of a donut and moved on. To me- problem solved. 

My mum now says that my brother sending that message was just an attempt to keep the peace (they really hate conflict). She has also said I’m happy to use my brothers when it suits me (she’s referring to the fact I went on to study special education, and was recently awarded a position leading trainings for teachers on supporting students on the spectrum, as well as working as an Autism specialised teacher. I also just completed my masters, with a focus on teaching students with ASD.) but won’t actually support them in the real world outside my work. 

I’m starting to think she’s right. 

So reddit, WIBTA if I continue with my plans to have a vegan cake. 

TLDR; I got a vegan cake for my birthday, my mum says I’m being exclusionary to my brother with ASD.

EDIT: Ok this got a little bigger than I thought. I have read every comment, and I will slowly reply to questions. To answer some common ones; 

1. I don’t feel comfortable sharing the name of the specific bakery, since it’s local. I’m really really happy that people want to support Australian businesses. I highly recommend the Instagram pages; Spend with them and Empty Esky. Both of these pages highlight business across all three affected states that have been impacted by the bushfires. There is also Buy from the bush, which highlights business that are affected by drought. I’m sure there’s others, but these are the three I’ve been following. 

2. I brought my own cake because of the cost of it. My mum isn’t in the best financial state, and it’s recently gotten worse as my younger two brothers (twins) turned 18 and she stopped receiving child support from our father. He hasn’t been in the picture for 15 or so years. 

3. My mum has no issue with me being vegan, when it’s just the two of us we always go to vegan places. 

4. The potential issues for my brothers is that it’s something different and new, which can be very overwhelming for people on the spectrum. They are very sensory, so very sensitive to taste and texture. It’s not that they’re being fussy brats or anything like that. They have genuine neurological difficulties with things, including food. 

5. My relationship with my brothers is the best it’s ever been. We argued a bit when I was younger, but I moved out at 17 and that solved a lot of issues. I’m a very social person (one brother jokes I got all the social genes and left nothing for them.) so moving out meant I could have as many parties as I wanted.","WIBTA for having a vegan cake for my birthday, despite my brothers refusal to eat it?"
535,AmItheAsshole,"I (27f) have not have a very good relationship with my father since I was about 17.

My parents split when I was 13, and as my parents both continued to live in the same town, my sister and I would live with my mother during the week and then with my father during the weekend for the most part.

When I was around 16, I moved in with my dad full time as my mother was forced to move due to not being able to afford her rent, so she moved in with her then-fiance in a neighbouring town. It was the best option at the time, meaning I wouldn't be uprooted and moved during my school year. My mother, father and stepfather have always had a relatively amicable relationship.

During this time, my father got a new girlfriend. She was nice to begin with but it soon became quite evident that she expected to be put above everyone else and essentially attempted to adopt the role of 'mother' after about 3 months. This led to a lot of drama between her and my actual mother, which I won't go into.

When I was 18 I fell pregnant. My father, under his girlfriend's instruction, kicked me out. We didn't speak or have anything to do with one another again until I was 26. My mother and her new partner were incredible however, took me in immediately and helped me through.

I have for a while now been considering changing my surname because I don't feel like I have any ties to him anymore. In my mind, he abandoned me when I needed him most. However, since we got back in touch he has been putting in more effort than I've ever known to rebuild our relationship. I feel that if I change my surname it will hurt him, but at the same time I don't feel any sort of real connection to it. I'd rather have my mother's maiden name, or my step-father's surname since they were the ones who reacted, in my mind, properly.

WIBTA if I do this? It could potentially destroy what little bridge we have rebuilt between us.

Edit: Just to clarify, I had been considering this before he got back in touch with me. This isn't a thought that's come about afterwards, but it has lingered.","WIBTA: If I changed my surname, knowing it will hurt my father?"

540,AmItheAsshole,"Title should be “not let my niece rent.” Sorry mobile typo.

Throwaway. 

So my wife and I own several properties in our state. We live in the suburbs full time but we’ve also got a very large luxury apartment right in the center of our city (one of most expensive in the world). On the market it would be around 4-5k per month to rent. 

Unlike some of our other properties, this apartment isn’t rented out. We stay there from time to time but in all honesty not very often at all. In the past year we’ve probably stayed there for less than 10 weekends total (we try to spend at least 1 weekend there per month). So this is a place that does sit empty for most of the year.

My niece recently got a post grad job in our city. While she was interviewing we offered to have her stay in this apartment while she got used to public transport, etc. She really fell in love with the place. 

Now she’s recently found her first job and really wants to stay in our place. My sister (her mom) wants us to officially lease it to her at drastically reduced rent (around 1.2k, her upper budget) since her argument is we don’t use it much anyways. 

My wife and I declined on the fact that 1) we still want the option of staying there from time to time and 2) having my niece as a legal tenant might cause problems later on. 

However the result is that my niece must now find a much, much cheaper market rate place that will be in a much worse part of town. She’s got some disabilities that prevent her from getting roommates, so the places she can afford by herself are all in very rough neighborhoods. 

My wife and I feel very guilty but also sure we made the right decision, but we recently had dinner with my niece and seeing how much she hates her new place also broke my heart a little. AITA

Edit: adding from comments. Niece stayed rent free for approx ~5 months since she had no income (no job) at the time. She also lives with a large service dog and since my wife is allergic we didn’t go over during that period. But all of this was unofficial, no contract, etc. She was registered with our building as a “guest” for those months and therefore had limited access to some facilities for instance. 

Our relationship with my niece is fine although my sister has been very cold and has told our parents that we’ve been less than helpful.

541,AmItheAsshole,"Hi! This is my first time posting here, please be gentle.

As the title says, I was wondering if it was rather inconsiderate or rude of me to feel uncomfortable that a family acquaintance was invited to my birthday dinner. I am turning 17 years of age very soon and have never experienced a good birthday, but my hopes were raised when my parents agreed to take me to my favorite buffet. I was ecstatic and very excited for my birthday for once. Then, about a few days ago, my dad casually walked into my room and tells me that he invited our neigbor (let's call her M) to come with us. M is a very nice lady who drove my father to and from surgery recently, which I am very grateful for. However, our family hasn't really known her for long and the only person who actually interacts with her is my father. I am also a little uncomfortable with her. The thing is, though, is that I felt angry because my father never asked me beforehand if I wanted to invite someone, which I did not. I don't like having other than my family and close friends in any social event with me. I would have understood if it was my father's birthday and he invited M, but it's mine and I don't like others calling the shots.

So, that's the entire post. Am I the asshole for feeling betrayed and angry that someone I am not comfortable with was invited to my birthday dinner without my permission?

However, things started changing after Christmas. For the first week everything was fine, she was even more cheerful and supportive. 
Then one day she had to write a work in Sociology which was important for her future University education. I was worried for her, hoped she would pass it with flying colors. When I asked her afterwards how it went for her, she seemed really happy, said everything went great.
A friend than messaged me and said my girlfriend posted a su***de-related story on Instagram. Upon checking her page, I found nothing. I got extremely worried and tried to call my girlfriend to find out if everything was alright. She said that she was really depressed about failing to do one of the tasks in the Sociology work, posted about being depressed and doing h**m to herself on Insta,  but hid her story about that  from me ""not to make me worried"". I gave her all the words of support I could and we made peace.

Despite that, we promised each other to ignore this inconvenience and continue hanging out. However, over the next few days she got more cold, always found excuses not to meet, seemed to have lost all interest in spending time together. 
I respected her words about not being able to meet, didn't want to push or sound intrusive. But I was beginning to get frustrated with this. I never blamed her, because I am unable to blame anyone but myself for any problems that happen. 
Yesterday,I asked her what caused the sudden shift for the worse in our and mentioned being worried about its effect on our relationship. She didn't take those words well, got really frustrated and didn't finish the conversation.She wrote me a lengthy message explaining   what was wrong with me. She said I neglected all the things she did to support me by talking about these issues. She also mentioned that I shouldn't have believed that friend's words about her doing some form of s**f-h**m without asking her first. The problem was that I didn't know what had happened and only had the information given to me by the friend of 5 years, who I think I could trust. I was lshocked when she mentioned my girlfriend doing s**f-h**m and was worried for her. She, however, now claims I only cared about the fact that she hid her Insta story from me.

547,AmItheAsshole,"I've been apart of my University's Formula Motorsport team ever since my 2nd year of uni (going into my final year now), where I've helped to design and build a mini Formula 1 car each year to compete against Unis from all over the continent.  

So right from the start, I was placed in the chassis team who are in charge making a full carbon fibre body for the race car. After only a couple months, I fell in love with carbon work and was regularly staying up past 3am to help get the chassis all built and ready to race.

Because of the time I was putting in, I gained a solid knowledge of how to deal with carbon and how to make any carbon part we may need. With the previous chasis sub-team leader heading off at the end of last year, I stepped up to the plate as the chassis lead and head of composites for our club. It's a role I worked hard to get, putting massive hours over the past year in particular to learn how to do everything I would need to make a bloody awesome car. I put so much time in that I even ended up failing a paper (oops, sorry mum) and have become the only guy in the club that knows how to make everything we need.

So now down to the WIBTA... I have just been told this afternoon by the team leads that the Uni has found a loophole in the rules, which means we can get by without having to build a new car body for the coming year. That means.... no chassis, no chassis team, and goodbye to that year of preparation, learning and ideas I had all ready to go :( 

After talking to the team leads (some good mates of mine), they're hoping to find me a spot doing some design job in another sub-team or a bunch of wee ones to keep me occupied for the year. And to rub salt into the wound, this also means I've gone from being one of the guys guaranteed to get a lighter final year workload to one that most likely will clean miss out. My uni offers 12 final year students working on the racecar a lighter studying workload (one less paper per semester) if they're a sub-team lead or in charge of a vital car component, which was me until my entire team was canned :(

So WIBTA for telling the team I want out because the one one thing I specialised in, was passionate about and was going to lead has been kicked to the curb? I love the club and designing and building a car is so rewarding, but this has made me lose all motivation to get involved. It would leave the team in an awful position as nobody else is able to make all the other car components needed, but I'd be having to do all this ontop of extra uni work they won't have to do (as a low level team member instead of the sub-team lead I was) while not being very passionate for the work regardless.",WIBTA For ditching the club I've spent the past 2 years in and leaving them screwed?
548,AmItheAsshole,"Bought this house 3 years ago. Family next door been here for generations. I have plenty of Parking in my driveway but I also have a street parking boulevard with grass that I have to mow and it is public parking of course.

. Neighbours friend of the family man has been using the boulevard infant of my house all the time to park. Coming and going several times a day.  They could park in front of the house they are going to, but they don't like to. I think they are trying to get the point across that they have used this area and won't stop (they used to use my yard too for years before I came along. I caught them throwing their weeds over the fence several times. She threw a mountain of yard waste in my yard for 2 years before I asked her not to.

Ok nobody owns that parking spot, and I am not short of parking, (although I do park there sometimes) but the friend of the family for 3 years, who runs a contracting thing, is always parking in front of my house, up on the grass on the boulevard that is parking. If  isn't my parking spot  I don't own it but I get sick of work trucks, or his trucks, left for days, sometimes a Giant work truck..

also it' intimate with my private yard.

So they park there a lot instead of the house they are visiting, the parking is WIDE open infron of the house most times, sometimes... not always. Sometimes they are switching trucks or whatever. I get sick of them parking infant of my house. I feels like they should park in front of their own house.

So I wrote their company  a complaint via Facebook. to the person doing it. I haven't ever talked to them about it.

EDIT - I forgot to mention this guy lives out of town and is running a contracting company. So it's like he is running a contracting company in front of my house.

EDIT 2 - reasons I am mad..  it's against the bylaws to run a contracting business form a home, but they guy is doing it in front of my home, it feels like a billboard is my view form my private yard, they could easy park a little over and are doing it to bug me, they are loud old trucks probably polluting the soil where they park inside of the street.",AITA for sending complaint about neighbours parking in front of my house
549,AmItheAsshole,"I (28F) have a chronic condition called interstitial cystitis (IC) as well as fibromyalgia. The IC is incredibly painful (it has been equated to the same level of pain experienced by late stage terminal cancer or renal failure patients by doctors) &amp; its incurable. I've had  6 surgeries since I was 20 trying to remove scar tissue, fix lesions, &amp; burn away wounds and ulcers in my bladder. I'm on a lot of medication for it, but I'm still in a lot of pain.

My urologist offered botox.  It supposedly helps, but there is a catch. You may not be able to pee for a few months afterwards &amp; will have to self catheterise (it also carries a risk of permanent bladder paralysis).   

I was polite &amp; thanked him for the kind offer but I said no. This illness has badly damaged my urethra, &amp; when I do have to have caterers in hospital I'm usually sobbing with pain. I *always* pick up a UTI afterwards. Sometimes I bleed for a few days afterwards due to tears. The fibromyalgia also heightens the pain I experience, which makes the ordeal even worse. 

The urologist looked really shocked and offended, &amp; asked to know why. When I politely explained my reasoning he got annoyed. He said I wasn't even trying to help myself, &amp; that if I really wanted to feel better I'd tolerate the discomfort for a couple of minutes. I stuck to my gut &amp; said no again, &amp; was told I should consider myself lucky, as not everyone is a candidate for the botox treatment, &amp; there are lots of people out there who would love this opportunity as it can really change people's lives. He also said that he almost never offers the treatment to patients my age, as he let's younger people ""live through it"" for a while before offering them the more invasive treatments, &amp; the patients he does consider eligible are typically 40 to 50 plus. 

That was a few days ago. I'm now torn &amp; really upset. On the one hand I know my body, &amp; I have enough experience to know that catheters cause lots of problems for me. More problems than they solve. The mere thought of permanent bladder paralysis terrifies me too, especially at my age. I know, both mentally &amp; physically, I wouldnt even be able to self catheterise once a week, let alone several times a day. On the other hand, I do feel like I'm somehow hurting all the people who haven't been presented with this opportunity, or will never be able to handle the botox treatment due to one issue or another.  I clearly pissed off the urologist too, &amp; I really don't want to be disrespectful, or criticise him, or anything like that.  I'm very non-confrontational, and very shy &amp; anxious, so saying no felt bad anyway. Now that guilt has been compounded and I can't stop thinking about everyone else out there suffering.

550,AmItheAsshole,"I've asked many friend's opinions on the matter and many seem to think that I am the A-hole for ""leading on"" my previous interest.

Some backstory: I've liked this girl, we'll call her Sofia, so Sofia and I have had an on and off relationship for the past year or so and I believed she was practically the one for me. I was lovestruck you could say. Long story short we had a thing but it ended due to partially her parents being Catholic and therefore Homophobic (I'm gay) and partially due to her not being comfortable with her sexuality and/or not knowing if she's straight/gay/bi whatever. We stayed pretty close friends and I often felt as if she was still inching at the fact that she still liked me but also saying things like ""Oh I don't like you like *that""* and thus I was roped along by her for a while but eventually, I let it go because I just accepted the fact that she was most likely straight. Then recently I met a girl who caught my eye and I got interested in her and started hanging out with her more, we'll call her Suzy. On Saturday I hung out with Suzy and whilst dropping her off I decided to just go for it I said: ""Hey, I *like* you."" and she promptly said ""I *like* you too"" and then it was pretty awkward and I dropped her off. Then the exact same night Sofia called me to her house and confessed she still had feelings for me like some kind of fucking Shakespeare play. All my feelings I bottled up for Sofia immediately swelled up. I really thought I was over her but it all just came crashing back. Then Sofia and I talked to reaffirm to each other we liked each other along with doing some *other* *things* that night and I slept over. This is where the problem is. When I confessed to Suzy it was genuine and heartfelt but then after that night, I had a lot of guilt. I then had to go tell Suzy the next day that basically I wasn't ready and that I needed to check my emotions before anything. Then through some mutual friends, Suzy was informed that I still had feelings for Sofia. This made Suzy cry. In the past, Suzy has been lead on by other people so now everyone is saying how I'm an asshole for say ""I like you"" to one person and then immediately moving on.

When I said ""I like you"" to Suzy I very genuinely meant it but I guess all my feelings for Sofia just weren't gone.

552,AmItheAsshole,"My son brought his girlfriend home for the first time. 

He doesn’t live anywhere nearby so it was kind of a big deal that he was bringing her out. 

Before they came he said things were getting very serious with this girl so he wanted us to do our best to get to know her and tell him what we thought. 

So we met her and she was a lovely person. Personality wise they were a great match and she was quite smart and pleasant to be around. 

There was one thing though. Typically people date people who are in their realm of attractiveness (7s go with 7s, 4s go with 4s, etc.) and this girl was... not particularly attractive. Not at all, actually. My son is fairly good looking so I didn’t understand how they’d come to be together. 

So afterwards, when we had a moment alone, my son asked us what we thought. I told him her personality was wonderful and, trying to be tactful, asked why he’d chosen to pursue a romantic relationship rather than a friendly one. 

He could tell I was trying to be polite about something so he said “we might move in together so if you noticed something just come out and say it, I want to know and make sure I’m going in informed.” And I said “Well it’s just you could do a lot better, looks wise.” 

Unfortunately he misunderstood it to be my saying he could be more attractive than he current is and started saying “Yah, this new haircut was a mistake, I should really change it. I’ve been trying to dress up more—“ and I cut him off and said “No I mean, *she’s* just not all that pretty.” 

He became very defensive and upset and basically told me I was wrong and then he left. 
I immediately apologized for how I’d phrased it, but I wasn’t sorry I’d said it, because he did ask us to tell him. 

My wife says it’s not something I should have said and it’s very clearly not what he was asking us to evaluate. But he said “he direct” and “tell me anything” he didn’t say “tell me anything except how she looks.” I definitely wish I’d worded it better, but should I just not have said anything at all?

I had never had a boyfriend before and this was the first time I ever got close to the prospect. Well, my mom always wished I would have a boyfriend and was so happy when I was dating him. Almost more happy than me, oddly. Well, he and I would text a lot naturally, and one time we were texting while I was out with my mom. Every time I would text him, my mom would ask ""what you saying to him? What did he say to you? What are you guys talking about right now?"" just CONSTANTLY, every time my phone buzzed. And my mom doesn't know english, so I couldn't just show her the screen, she wouldn't understand it. So I started to get really annoyed and tired about having to explain every single thing he or I said. Especially because, most of the time it really wasn't anything special, and I thought I deserved a little privacy? Like maybe I'm fucking sexting him, what do you care? So I told my mom to please give me a little space and not ask what we're talking about every two seconds. She got really offended and said she was just really happy and excited for me and it was temporary, and that I shouldn't have ruined her enthusiasm right away. That I should have just waited until her excitement cooled down and she would get off my back eventually.

Both me and my sis had a pretty bad upbringing. Our parents were complete assholes to us and emotionally abusive. 

So my sis tells me that she regrets all of it and was lashing out ''because she was in pain''. Then she said ''a lot of bullies...they're just in pain''.

I was a bit confused cos I had the same upbringing as her, and got treated badly by our parents, but I never once felt tempted to bully someone. In fact, it made me feel more empathetic to people because I knew how they were feeling. So I said to my sis ''Um, not everyone who is in pain becomes a bully. I never bullied anyone, and neither did any of my friends who went through shit''.

I know I sound like I’m jealous, but I want to stress that it’s not his material items I disapprove of, it’s his lack of care and interest to anybody around him. He pays my mom a lot of money so she’s in his pocket, and he parades around his 8 y/o as though he’s a toy or pet, not as though he’s a living breathing child.

This obviously impacts my nephew and he’s told me in the past he wishes mommy was as happy as daddy.

My stepmom is unemployed and my Dad works 14+ hour days 4 days a week while receiving child support (~1000$a month) from my mom. But about 1 year ago I finally made the decision to start living with my mom which meant my dad had to start paying my mom.

I ordered a ukulele from a major music chain store (we'll call it Music Store). I'm a new player...just started about a month ago. I started learning basic chords on my kid's $25 plastic ukulele.

I was enjoying it! So I did some research and found a brand that I thought would be good for a beginner but also last me a long time. I went to the MS over the weekend and picked one out. The store clerk said it was out of stock but could be shipped to my house. Perfect. It was also $20 less than the ticket listed...(total of $90).

I've been tracking the package all week - kept seeing the picture of the simple but pretty ukulele I picked out. Package arrived today and as soon as I opened it I knew it wasn't the one I ordered. Similar looking, same brand, but minor differences in color and markings. I cross checked the shipping label and model of the ukulele I ordered and the one I was sent. On the MS website, the order number brought up my $90 model. The sticker number on the one I received brought up a $220 ukulele.

So. WIBTA if I called it a lucky mistake on MS's part and kept the more expensive one?

566,AmItheAsshole,"Throwaway because I’m active on this sub and a few others and wish to be judged purely for this post.

I am 29/F and getting married this August (my fiancé is 34/M). I have three bridesmaids. Two of them are my cousins who are close to my age, the other one is my fiancé’s 16 year old niece, Olivia. I have also been a bridesmaid three times. The first time, I was 17 years old and didn’t have a job. My parents paid for my dress since I didn’t have the means to. The other two times were within the last couple of years and as I now have a job, I paid for my own dress. Also, all of these dresses were purchased from David’s Bridal, so they were very reasonably priced. I think the most that was spent was $125 thanks to sales. Admittedly I don’t know how much the dress that I wore when I was 17 cost, but I imagine it was around the same as the others. 

Olivia is my fiancé’s sister’s daughter. Sadly, my fiancé’s sister passed away 15 years ago. Since then, Olivia has always lived with her father who now is married to a wonderful woman. My fiancé has known Olivia’s father and stepmom for a long time (probably 18 and 10 years, respectively) and I’d like to think we have a very good relationship with them.

For my wedding, I would like for Olivia’s father and stepmom to pay for her bridesmaid’s dress but I don’t know how to ask, or if it’s already assumed. As far as I know, they make more money than my fiancé and I, but they provide for two children and we don’t. If the dress will hopefully only be around $120-$130, truthfully, my fiancé and I CAN afford that. It’s just that we’re paying for so many other aspects of our wedding, so anywhere that we can cut spending would really help. As I said, I think we have a good relationship with Olivia’s dad and stepmom, but I know money can be a touchy subject and I don’t want to jeopardize anything. 

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I ask Olivia’s parents to pay for her bridesmaids dress for my wedding?


EDIT: So sorry, one major detail I forgot to include! My cousins, the other two bridesmaids, are paying for their own dresses. I am not paying for their dresses. However I am paying for all four of us, plus my mom and future MIL to have our hair and makeup done on the wedding day.

EDIT 2: Thanks for the responses, including the YTAs. I appreciate the different ways of thinking. Clarifying some INFO comments- We haven’t decided on dresses yet so I’m not 100% sure of the cost. I want each bridesmaid to pick her own dress. All I care is that the color is the same. I’m fine if they are different styles, as long as everyone is comfortable. So hopefully it will cost even less than what I’m thinking. Also, for the last wedding I was a bridesmaid in, the bride told us that if we ordered the dress by a certain date, we’d get 20% off even though the wedding wasn’t for almost a year after. That was around this time last year, so I’m hoping I can tell my bridesmaids something similar.",WIBTA if I expect my minor bridesmaid’s family pay for her dress in my wedding?

okay, so I run a meme account about my university about a group of majors. It’s gotten some relative attention, like a 1’000ish followers, and it’s been pretty fun. Last night, there was an event by the arts’ major, that was pretty dead, and my friend livened it up, so I posted a meme about that situation.

Someone messaged me, from the organisers, telling me that I was an asshole for that meme, and that they worked really hard, and that that meme, and a previous meme about “art students complaining about workload”, and that if I wanted to preach “my SJW bs”, I had to respect that art students worked the hardest, and then proceeded to tell me I’m defamatory and a “liberal art fuck”.

568,AmItheAsshole,"So this past semester I decided that I need to move rooms or else I probably would go insane because of my current roommate. It had gotten so bad that I had to leave for home practically every weekend just to get away from him. 

He constantly has kept me awake at night from his mechanical keyboard and talking on discord when I have early classes (sometimes 8 ams) the next day which I have talked to him about but it doesn’t seem to connect. 

I am by no means a neat freak, but he leaves clothes all over and just keeps his bag of laundry practically in the middle of the room so it’s the first thing you see, which sometimes even gets in the way of walking around. I’ve asked him to move this under his bed as there is room and he did that, but eventually it made its way back out and stayed there. 

Once when I went home for the weekend apparently he practically had a sleepover with one of his friends and allowed his friend to sleep in my bed. I got back that Sunday night and one of my blankets was folded on the end of my bed so I asked why and he told me that it was “from when ___ was here” so I just thought he folded it so he wouldn’t sit on it. Little did I know he had slept in my bed which I learned about 2 weeks later while we were eating lunch. 

Finally, another time I had gone home he came back from his night shift as a deskworker in one of the dorms and just randomly took some of my food. I came back that Sunday night and asked him if he had any, which wouldn’t have been such a huge problem, but instead of owning up to it he lied to my face and said he didn’t. The coincidence with him lying about that was that before I left I took a picture in my food box so I could see what I had so I could go grab more snacks from the store and it was the weekend he took something. He waited until the next day and then instead of just apologizing to my face he decided to send me a text about how horrible he felt and never once said anything to my face about it. 

I’m not normally someone to get irritated just at someone’s being, but every time now I see him I just get put in a bad mood, and the thing is he hasn’t even done any self reflection and told one of our friends that he thinks something isn’t right at home for me because I’ve been acting different.

So am I the asshole for going behind his back practically and not telling him that I’ve asked the housing director if I can get moved to anywhere else?

I (24F) live with my sister (24F), I will call her S. I work full time and take night classes full time. ""S"" is a full time student but has been unemployed for a month, for the first time since she was 18.  ""S"" was fired from a relatively new job for oversleeping/calling out of shifts due to staying up late with new school friends. These friends live at home/are jobless/have no bills -- which I think ""S"" envies. When agreeing to live together ""S"" was not in school but she was working full time in a great career. She has clearly chosen to prioritize her college education by studying theater instead of working again.

I was responsible for ""S"" getting to work on time daily. She had to leave at **7am**? Gotta set an alarm to go off *every five minutes* **starting at 5am**. Despite all of this ""effort"", ""S"" still overslept. The only reason ""S"" would wake up in time for work is bc *I was* *woken up by her alarms* and it took me yelling at 7am that I was tired of hearing her alarms for her to wake up... Her alarms really woke *EVERYONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE* ***BUT HER.*** Obviously I was miserable due to the constant alarms keeping me awake for hours before I needed to be awake, I began taking on a lot more at work and also taking night classes full time. My patience/energy levels were nonexistent. I told her I couldn't keep doing this because I needed rest and I refused to wake her.

Naturally, ""S"" was shortly fired. ""S"" spent every night out with friends and wasn't able to wake up and adult. This job was a great opportunity for ""S"" bc it was commission-based but it allowed her to work part time hours and make full time money, all while letting her go to school full time, too. It's now been a month since she lost this job. ""S"" spends *every day* that she is not at school with friends. It's extremely frustrating that ""S"" is 24 yrs old but is prioritizing a social life over paying her bills.

I received this text from her at 12:42AM: asking me to wake her and her friends up in time for them to go to school in the morning because they were not capable of doing this on their own.

This was officially my breaking point. I am not their mother. If my 24 year old sister still needs help waking up to go to school... That is on her. We are all adults in this house and we all have our own things on our plate. I am not going to become responsible for waking a bunch of grown people up so they can go to school the next day because they got too drunk to do so themselves.

570,AmItheAsshole,"My boyfriend (bf, 40) and I (30) have been together for a couple of years, and I was invited to his brother's wedding in Europe (we live in the US). The timeline was pretty short - I was invited in July for a December wedding.

Prior to the engagement, I had already planned a vacation (girls' trip) that spanned from the end of November-beginning of December (booked in April). I told bf I didn't think I could attend the wedding because I didn't have enough time off work or money for the plane ticket (my expenses would have been covered after I got there). Then I was actually able to get a couple of days off work, but the plane ticket was $1500, so bf acknowledged it was a lot of money and travel time for being there such a short amount of time (3 days). I decided not to go because I was uncomfortable with the cost, and he seemed OK with it (not preferred by either of us, but that's life).

About 10 days out from the wedding, he was already in Europe and started texting me that I ""should have been here"" and that I have ""many more years to work and earn money, but there's only one wedding.""

After he got back, we got into a huge fight. He told me if I really wanted to be there that I should have charged it to my credit card because it wouldn't have taken long to pay it off. I pointed out that he has a lot more money than me (family money) so, if he wanted me there, he should have offered to help me pay for at least some of it.

He argued I am not his financial responsibility and, because I was able to afford the girls' trip, I should have planned my money better and done both trips. I said that his brother's plans shouldn't have trumped my pre-booked vacation and, instead of guilting me about not being able to afford it, he also could have spent some of his money helping me get to the wedding instead of using it to buy the fancy clothes, sports and concert tickets, etc. that he purchased while he was in Europe.

I'm assuming ESH, but I'd imagine we'll end up in a similar situation at some point (we are in two very different social classes), so hoping the responses will help avoid this scenario in the future.

EDIT: To people wondering why I think ESH is because I brought up his purchases, which really aren't my business.

573,AmItheAsshole,"I was sitting in my crowded lecture of around 500 students today with my friend when this girl decided to sit down next to us. She immediately began coughing and I thought, ""oh great, another sick person."" I was not expecting, however, for her to continuously cough for 45 minutes (literally every 30 seconds she would be hacking out a lung and I could literally hear the phlegm come up her throat) WITHOUT EVEN ATTEMPTING TO COVER HER MOUTH. I was actually completely taken aback by her lack of respect for anyone around her. At first, I tried to turn away and learn toward my friend every time she would have a coughing fit hoping that she would realize that she was making me uncomfortable, but she still didn't get the message. After that, I tried zipping up my jacket all the way up to my nose (it's one of the windproof ones that cover your neck and shit), hoping she'd get the memo, but she still didn't!!

Finally, my friend told me that I should say something and I was reaching my fucking wit's end so I turned to her and said, ""excuse me, can you please cover your mouth when you cough? It's completely disgusting and inconsiderate of you to cough like that with others around you.""

She was a Chinese international student so I don't know if she understood me completely, but she seemed to get the message that I was upset about her coughing. Like I know that it's much more common in China to not give a shit about covering your mouth when coughing (I know because me and my family are Chinese), but you're in an American university now so please learn to be more considerate.

She ended up half-heartedly shielding her coughs for the next half hour (she would just put her hand up like six inches from her face) while complaining about me being a rude, conceited bitch in Chinese on WeChat on her computer.

Despite not having a clue (he thought a printer was a scanner), he can't use photoshop, he just kept hovering over me/ taking the mouse to try and do things, taking control of the process/ getting angry about how slow the computer was etc. He got snippy at me when I was like, 'actually I'm just going to do it this way'.

I got very annoyed, I'm not a photoshop pro by ANY means, but I knew enough to be able to troubleshoot what I wanted to get done and get it done. I told him he could leave, that I didn't need him to stay. He decided to stay, by about the third hour, I was pissy. I was just silently cracking on with my work, he was sat beside me, and I was ignoring him. Intently, when he asked me things. Even when they were nice things, I gave very short answers and shut him down. To be completely honest I just wanted him to fuck off.

577,AmItheAsshole,"I live in a country where smart people are usually either shit on or are talked about badly behind the back of  from bad people.

Because I live in a third world country, we sometimes have to listen to the Facebook pages of the Ministry of Education to know when not to go to school - in times where it snows badly, unfavorable temperatures, etc...

Our class has a snap chat group where we talk about homework and other stuff like this. I saw that they were talking about if we should go to school tomorrow, they didn't know about the post on Facebook. I sent a link to it and some dude that left our school last year was like: ""Oh yeah, he doesn't want to go to school because his marks all very high and he doesn't need to get them back anyway"" **(Keep in mind here that I'm 1st in class. Also, our school system is very easy and if you study even a little bit you WILL pass. We have a specific day after the first semester of school to get our exam papers back, tomorrow is exactly that day for us.)**

578,AmItheAsshole,"About 5 years ago, my wife and I separated because of something I did (not an affair, but still pretty devastating to our relationship). During that time, I stayed with my parents. My sister also lived with them. I thought everyone was pulling for my wife and I to get back together until we actually got back together 3-4 months later. 

When my wife and I walked through the door at my parents to pack up my stuff and take it home, my sister was inside and she literally stopped dead in her tracks and turned and left without a word. It was a nasty surprise, and the icing on the cake was that I had been reassuring my wife on the way over that my family supported us getting back together. And now my sister was punishing her for something she didn’t do. 

*Edit: One time, approximately 3 months after all this went down, I met my sister at a bar, where she told me the reason she didn’t come to my birthday party the previous day was because my wife was there. She told me she doesn’t forgive her for causing me so much pain. I told her it was my fault, not hers. She said there were the political differences as well. She also didn’t like my wife’s response to my dad’s teasing. I told her finally that if she continued that way I couldn’t maintain a relationship with her. I thought when I left that got through to her, but it didn’t.*

Anyway, this kind of behavior of just ignoring my wife continued for a couple years (I still think I shouldn’t have waited so long) as we tried to navigate family events and such. It was fucking emotionally exhausting, and no other member of my family seemed to recognize how toxic this dynamic was. 

Finally, a couple years ago, after beating around the bush, I gave her an ultimatum: she didn’t have to be friends, but either she make up with my wife or we cut her out. I’m not letting her get away with treating my wife like shit anymore. She opted for the latter. I called my family and informed them. *EDIT: This ultimatum was not a final one—I told her it would last until she patched things up.*

Fast forward to the present. I’m prepping for a visit to my hometown. Due to previous incidents where my sister made surprise appearances during past visits, I ask my brother to inform me if she’s going to be at any of the things I’m going to be at so I can be elsewhere. 

And this is where I get really wound up just thinking about this, because he goes off saying how this whole thing is tearing our family apart and he wants to know if it’s worth it. He tells me he’s not sure what exactly the beef is between me and her. He wants to know how I envision things 10 years from now. I have answers for all of this. Of course I know it’s tearing the family apart. Of course I don’t think it’s worth it. I have no idea what things will look like in ten years. I wind down the call and hang up. *AITA for staying the course, here?*

Maybe you can see there’s some tension behind my writing here. I am angry. I didn’t go into the brutal emotional struggles my wife and I had trying to put our marriage back together with a hostile family member in our midst. The damage is real and severe, and I can’t ignore that. I feel some doubt whenever the subject comes up with my family, because they don’t understand why I’d cut off my sister. Then I get angry, because I feel like I’m being gaslighted. 

Sorry for the rambling. I’m not a great writer, but I feel like it still captures the gist of the situation.

EDIT: I did not demonize my wife to my sister. I was a mess for much of the time, however. I believe this had an impact on her, and I personally think she originally acted out on a tribalistic level. That’s my guess. I did have a drink at a bar with her once. In addition to implying she blamed my wife for what I went through (that is to say, she felt my wife overreacted), two other reasons she brought up then were political differences and my wife’s negative reaction to my dad’s teasing.

EDIT 2: Oh boy, here goes. We originally separated because I had been hiding and lying about a very important part of my life for almost two years. The specifics are really not relevant. I think you can see without details how damaging that was to the trust in our relationship and why she would want a separation. It took about two years to get to a stable place after that.",AITA for refusing to be in the same vicinity as my sister?
579,AmItheAsshole,"(apologies for the text, I’m on mobile and this is my first post ever)
Some background: I spent two years active duty in the Army, joined when I was 18 and came back to welcoming parents who have allowed me to live comfortably in their home while I work full-time before I eventually switch to college full-time.(switched to National Guard) I get up at 4 am and work until 3pm and I go immediately from work to coach a high school JROTC team until about 6pm, then the gym to stay in shape since i’m still in the army and get tested.  I usually get home, have dinner with my family, help clean up and help my mother do any other tasks she needs to get done, shower, try and get into bed by 8 and repeat Mon-Fri. I drive up to a town four hours away for my Army Drills for the weekend once a month every month.

Recently my mother has become very passive aggressive hinting at me not helping her out (I feel it’s juvenile, just talk to me about it and tell me how else I can help if not doing enough). We had dinner and I helped clean off the table and put things away. I enter the kitchen to see dishes stacked on top of each other in the sink and she proceeds to yell at me, scream that I do nothing I don’t help out after she “repeatedly asked me to do the dishes) to be honest genuinely offending me as if I was a bum sitting at home doing nothing. My sibling stepped in and told her that she had never asked me to do them?? (I would’ve happily done them if I knew they were just sitting there) 
Anyways, I have to drive up to Orlando and quite frankly Im so offended at how she’s acting like i’m at sit-at-home bum mooching off my parents house considering how much i try and support them when they’re slipping financially and my military healthcare plan is what they are on, which comes out of my pay.

580,AmItheAsshole,"This past weekend I was very sick with a debilitating cold which also happened to coincide with a visit from my boyfriend’s mom who only visits once or twice a year. We mostly hung out at the house but we decided to go out to dinner, despite how shitty I was feeling I still wanted everyone to have a good time. We went to a place just a couple blocks away that we like that’s basically an Italian diner. I was wrapped up in a coat with handfuls of tissues and cough drops, dizzy and nauseous the entire time but I did my best to get through it. I couldn’t eat more than a few bites of food, and by the end I felt half-dead. My boyfriend and his mom seemed to have a good time, but I was miserable in a little cocoon of sickness.

Fast forward to today and where the AITA comes in - I’m finally feeling better, and my boyfriend says he’s working late so we’ll have to do dinner separately. I figure I’ll order takeout from the Italian place to treat myself after having a difficult week of being sick and to sort of make up for the meal I couldn’t eat much of before. I mentioned it to my boyfriend when he asks what I ate, and he got upset. His reasoning is because whenever I buy food for both of us it’s “cheap shit” like fast food or whatever and I got “expensive” food for myself. (added an edit at the bottom to explain) I bought an entree and dessert for less than $14, so it’s hardly expensive. I said he’s overreacting and I just wanted to treat myself to a nice meal like he had over the weekend, but he’s mad I didn’t get anything for him. I probably could’ve asked if he wanted anything but I just wasn’t concerned with it since he said we were eating separately. AITA?

Edit for INFO: I paid with my money, we don’t have shared funds. We buy takeout frequently, probably more than we should, and we take turns who pays for it. We usually get the same fast food options but when he gets food he will often pay more to have it delivered instead of driving to get food like I do to save money. So I guess that’s what he means by me buying “cheap shit” even though he almost always gets the same things I do but he pays more to have it brought to the house rather than pick it up himself. Whenever we go to a sit-down place we split the bill, unless one of us pays for the other for a birthday or something. When we eat at home I pay for groceries and do the cooking myself. I hope this answers any questions.",AITA for treating myself to a “fancy” meal while my boyfriend was busy?
581,AmItheAsshole,"I woke up today a little nauseous, but ignored it because sometimes it happens. I went to work, and for the next hour I started getting more nauseous and really dizzy. 

I recently had a medicine change that upped my dosage from 200 to 300 mg all at once. The medication so far was slowly increased by 25mg per two weeks before. (After I got home from work I checked the side effects and dizziness and nausea were regular symptoms with upping the dose. I've never had a problem with it before.)

I was fighting the urge to throw up for a little bit before I shamefully approached my boss and told him that I was horribly nauseous and didn't want to throw up on the job (food service). I asked if I could leave and he said if I needed to I could, but he was really angry about it. He said he couldn't get anybody else to cover my shift right now (I was counter girl at the time, I helped answer phones and got pizzas out of the oven) but I could still leave. 

I apologized up and down and before I left, he said that he thinks that I am lying about it because I ""wasn't sick"" when I came in and I looked fine. I tried to explain to him that I really really felt horrible, and that I never leave work because I like working there and I feel horrible to leave. I mentioned I almost never call out and he remarked that I have before.  

A couple months ago I had called out. When I called out then, I was sitting over the toilet seat crying on the phone with him trying to explain that I couldnt come in. I felt horrible for doing it but I just couldnt come in. I also called out sick for a few days because of a severe UTI about a year ago. I went to the emergency room for that. 

I wasn't lying and I feel even more like an asshole for leaving. I have a good relationship with my boss and he really likes me so this was far out of left field for me.

582,AmItheAsshole,"Six months ago i (25) went through several traumatic things all in a short span of time, which have catapulted my life into being completely different and threw me into a deep depression.

I started therapy, and it wasn't long before my therapy sessions began revolving around my relationship with my dad. He has for years insisted that I've never given him the respect he's earned as a parent for all the things he's done for me. Every therapist I've ever seen told me that he has unrealistic expectations for a parent-child relationship and that everything he's complained about have been developmentally appropriate behaviors for my age at the time (aka me just being a teenager). I've made multiple serious efforts to hear him out and talk through our issues over the years, which have never been successful. Gaining clarity in therapy combined with my total exhaustion from trauma led me to ask him to go to therapy a few months ago in not the most sugarcoated way i could have. He took this as a personal attack even though i have since repeatedly framed it as ""we haven't been able to stop fighting for years despite our best efforts, since we love each other i think it's time we both seek professional help to help us get along"" as well as wanting him to get therapy for his own support system. Our relationship has steadily declined since i asked him to go.

Our last conversation was a month ago. He called and asked me to forgive someone who traumatised me. I expressed directly, but not aggressively, that that was inappropriate and hurtful. He hung up on me twice. Less than a week later he calls me and starts making small talk. I tell him verbatim that i am frustrated and confused about why he's making small talk when he hung up on me in our last phone call. He got very upset and says I'm too critical of him, and i never let him forget anything he's ever done wrong despite everything he's ever done for me as a parent, and that i treat him like shit. Later that night he sends me an itemized email of everything he's ever done for me. We haven't spoken since.

I haven't been calling my parents because i can't handle an iota of extra stress from us fighting more. I've been speaking to my mom when she calls me. I've never had any significant issues with her until she recently bribed me to talk to my dad, which i found very offensive. She hasn't called in two weeks. I know that they're both deeply saddened by us not talking. I know that my mom is taking it extremely hard. It's also my dad's birthday next week.

I feel like me initiating contact will be as though I'm agreeing that i fucked up the relationship and it's my job to fix it. I also literally don't have the energy to entertain any extra stress right now while i heal from my other traumas. I never intended to cut off contact permanently, just take some breathing room. Am i the asshole if i don't call my dad for his 60th birthday, or mom when i know she's in a dark place?",AITA for not talking to my parents
583,AmItheAsshole,"So I (18F) am a new college student. I took a gap semester because I moved states first and that was really hectic. Last week was the first week of school. I have English class twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I’m usually a bit early, one of the first ones there, so seats are usually pretty empty.

This Tuesday, I decided to sit in this one empty seat at the end of the second row, since it’s close to the front (which I prefer because I’m very nearsighted) but not too close (the front row is REALLY close to the teacher, like uncomfortably). I know one of my classmates, an older woman (I’m guessing 50s or 60s because she has fully grey hair) usually sits there, but there’s no assigned seating, so I figured it wouldn’t be a problem. Class was fine, I went on to next period, day was good.

Well today, I walked in a bit later (had troubles with my GPS but was still on time), and decided today I’d sit at the end of the front row (in front of the second row seat I was in Tuesday, since that one was already taken) since our professor was teaching on the other end of the room, so it shouldn’t be too close to him. 

As I’m putting my things on the table, the woman asked “Excuse me, what’s your name?”

Me: “[Name]”

Her: “Okay, [Name], well I’m sure you don’t know this because you were late registration-“ (which is not true, i’ve been there since day one?) “-but on Tuesday I walked in and you were in my seat. Now, that didn’t make me very happy, because you see on the first day of school, everyone kind of already picked which seats they were gonna be in, and it’s not fair that they all got to sit in theirs and I had to find somewhere else to sit.” (Also not true, no one has definitively “picked their seat”, many kids have moved around). 

So throughout the whole conversation I was just like “Okay.” In a tone that wasn’t mocking or anything, but showed I wasn’t taking her seriously. I thought this would be the end of it, but a few minutes later, she leans forward and brings it up AGAIN.

Her: “If you want, I can help you find another seat. There’s an empty one here, here, over there-“ And at this point I felt really patronized, as if I’m a child who can’t find my own seat. I mean, hell, I DID find my own seat, I was already sitting in it, so this was really unnecessary. 

At that point, I told her “No thanks. I don’t really care about that, because it’s *just a seat.*”

She was clearly taken aback by my response, and that was effectively the end of the conversation. I have a feeling if I ever sit there again she’s gonna make it a bigger deal, maybe even tell the professor on me because she seems like the type.

In my opinion, you can’t tell other people they don’t have the right to sit somewhere. But maybe there is some unspoken social rule I broke or something. AITA?",AITA for sitting in someone’s seat?
584,AmItheAsshole,"Recently my school brought color guard back after about 35 years. The club was completely organized and put together by one of my friends, we’ll call her Lizzie. Lizzie found the old color guard flags in the closet and talked to the band teacher, saying it would be cool for us to bring it back. 

Fast forward a bit and Lizzie personally found everyone who joined and also took the first steps to plan our meetings and just overall organize the entire group. 

The coach (band teacher?? Whatever you want to call him) after a month or so decided to elect a captain with ZERO vote from the group and without any heads up. It was a girl who had really done a super minimal amount of work for the group, and it just caught me off guard. 

I ended up talking with the other girls (at least half, it’s a small group) and they all said they weren’t happy with it as well, and we all collectively agreed to go talk to him. 

To sum it up we all voiced that Lizzie has proven her leadership for color guard since day one, and she’s also willing to give up band for this. I tried to keep all opinions on the current captain out, because I honestly am friends with her too, and that’s where I’m conflicted. 

He basically said that he felt we didn’t give the current captain a chance and we were acting like we were “forcing” him to make him take her out of her position, and just doing this because “we didn’t like her”.  He also said that this is run more as a “dictatorship” than a democracy. ( he seemed to quickly cover that up though, seeming to realize how bad that sounded)

Lizzie still isn’t in the leadership position, and our current captain isn’t just NOT who we all wanted, but she’s the only one who is quite lacking in the group and is never on time with spins and such. (Now she’s also creating our routines because she is captain, and the whole thing looks like an utter joke)

I felt so bad going to him to voice our opinion on someone who I consider my friend, and him saying that we were just doing this out of spite honestly just sucked. He was genuinely pissed off at us for coming and talking to him, too. 

I really don’t want to go back to color guard after this, and I’m scared now that I’ll lose a friend over something stupid like this. 

The meeting prior to this he also went out of his way to only pick on me for being “off time” when I was on time with everyone else while the only one who wasn’t was our current captain, who he praised. 

It’s just all an odd situation and the other girls and I feel super bummed about talking to him, we genuinely went in just hoping to tell him our opinion, and left without doing that and feeling terrible afterwards. AITA? Should I have just left it alone?",AITA for voicing a group opinion against a captain for a school club?

Eventually we made our way to a makeup store at the mall. My lady friend’s friend decided to take some lipstick and the associate working clearly sees her take it she says nothing. I’m embarrassed as we leave the store when I confront her and say I would’ve bought it she gets confrontational.

587,AmItheAsshole,"So. Long story as short as possible: I am in my mid 20s. An old high school friend of mine named Jan lost her sister to addiction and the visitation was yesterday. Even though Jan and I were friends in high school, we were never super close and have lost touch since graduating.  Jan is still extremely close with our mutual best friend Aline. Whenever I see Jan, it's always at Aline's major functions (her wedding, baby shower, etc.). Very infrequently. But, Aline invited me to accompany her to the visitation, and I really wanted to go to show support... Jan is genuinely one of the sweetest people I've ever met. However, I completely underestimated how emotional I would become. I lost my own brother to addiction months ago, and when we got there everything started to come back seeing her sister's belongings and photos as we walked up the line of people. Keep in mind I have NEVER met any of her family but Jan.

I made it past Jan's grandma and mom in line and told them how sorry I was. But when I got to her dad, for some reason I lost it. I don't know why... maybe it was because Jan was next in line and I could see her crying. Jan's dad was all-smiles (if you have ever lost a family member, you will understand what I mean. He was in that surreal mode of being cheery despite the circumstances, when you know he is really crushed inside). It was highly awkward, I was sobbing, he started telling me it was okay, and I felt HORRIBLE because he was the one who had lost someone. Then I saw Jan, and we both hugged each other and cried. I did tell her I was so sorry for her loss and that I loved her.

The worst part was, her little brothers were next to her. They are around 18-20ish I'd guess. It was already incredibly awkward, because I was freshly sobbing from hugging Jan and telling her how sorry I was. I completely froze in front of Jan's little brothers, and before I knew it I heard myself saying, ""Wow. You two look like Jan. Well, actually you look like eachother."" Then I made some weird wave with my hand almost like a 'voila' movement? And walked away without even saying sorry. Keep in mind I was sobbing this whole time.

I could tell it made her family uncomfortable, specifically her little brothers, and I couldn't even think straight enough to say I was sorry for their loss. AITA for making visitation worse for them and causing a semi scene? Again, I think I underestimated how close to home this would hit. I probably should've stayed home and send a damn card. I definitely am not going to the funeral, because it isn't my place.",AITA for causing a scene at my friend's sister's funeral visitation?
588,AmItheAsshole,"This is going to require context, so humor me here for a second. My(28m) fiancee is 24(f) years old, and we are currently living with her mother. We have been together almost 4 years, We are both professionals, and make enough to get a nice apartment or a starter house. we live with her mother because her mother is in her 70's, overweight, and not capable of doing the majority of the house work. I moved out of my parents when I was 18 so I'm used to living on my own. My girlfriend was adopted by her mother when she was two years old, so she feels indebted to her mother on and extreme level, and is very co-dependent with her mom. Things I may need to ask her to do for months, will be done for her mother if she even HINTS at wanting it done (cleaning her section of the bedroom, doing laundry, etc.). Anyways, back in November, my fiancee asked me if I would work up a diet and exercise plan for us to start in January, because she wants to lose weigh, and she knows I used to be a major gym rat. Fast forward to January, and last week she asks me what our diet will involve, and I show her the foods. It's pretty restrictive, but it's a low-no carb diet, and is built for fat burning. She's not excited but I figured she'd feel that way. A few hours later she comes back down and asks me ""would you be angry if my mother and I just do nutrisystem instead? We saw an ad on the TV and my mom is interested"" I told her honestly that, I wouldn't be angry, but I'd definitely be annoyed after planning to do all this together, and then at the 11th hour she backs out, and not only doesn't do the diet I planned for us, but does this other thing with her mother instead (who I have never once heard express interest in losing weight). So after I express this, she goes back upstairs, and 5 days pass with no more mention of it, so I assume we're back on track for our original plan. Then I came home from work and saw a stack of nutrisystem boxes on our porch. Iater that night when my fiancee asked me why I seemed like I was annoyed, I explained that I feel like I'm engaged to her mother because she factors in every single decision we make. I told her this isn't normal, and that I think we could probably use some counselling before we get married just to get an impartial voice, and work this stuff out before it becomes a major source of resentment for me. I tried to calmly explain that I think we need to get our own place, and that I think she needs to start setting some boundaries with her mother. She started bawling, said I was calling her crazy, and thought I was being ridiculously over reactive for making an issue out of it. I tried to explain that is wasn't the diet, it was that something that was meant for us was just co opted by her mother, and that she chose to appease her mother over the commitment she made to me. I feel like I'm in the right, but I live up here with just her and her mother, and don't really want to talk about this to people at work. AITA?

Edit : I tried to add this but couldn't due to the character limit, but think it's necessary now for more context on their relationship.

 This isn't just an isolated event. We can't go out to dinner, because her mother needs to be brought back food and she doesn't like any of the restaurants in our area so my girlfriend feels guilty and says we can't go. We can't go out for date nights because both of us have work schedules that shift and her mother gets upset if we don't give her 3 days notice that we will be out for part of the evening. If I use the square frying pan to cook anything other than pancakes her mom will shut down and go close herself off in her room. Her mother has a dog that she leashes to her la-z-boy all day every day, that vomits all over the house, and her mom insists she will clean, but she has yet to clean a single one of, and I am not allowed to mention it according to my fiancee. My fiancee just goes along with these things, and if I ask about them, or God forbid if I am critical, it makes her very upset.","AITA for telling my fiancee that she is co-dependent on her mother, and we need couples counselling?"
589,AmItheAsshole,"I have an extremely friendly dog who loves people and other dogs. So there is this tiny little park that is blocked off on all sides except a hole. It has a dog bag dispenser and a dog poop trashcan. I have seen numerous dogs off-leash in this park, and nobody has cared when I let him off. I normally keep a close eye on him for obvious reasons, but the second I looked away, an elderly couple came walking their dog. He runs off to go say hi, and I even manage to stop him for a second. Then he resumes running off and I chase after him. I'm under 15 so it took me a sec to catch up and I hear them saying stuff. As I'm running up to leash him, I hear ""Get your fucking dog right now"" and in my shock, I look up and see their dog (easily twice the size of my dog who walked up happily) cowering and a furious expression on the guy (about 70). I apologize while getting up to walk away when I hear ""Sorry doesn't count, it is illegal, go tell your parents"". I walked home hurling insults in my mind and told my best friend, who did the same

I searched it up and it is illegal, but it was created recently because of dogs running and biting people and other dogs, and my dog has never been aggressive. So AITA?

Edit: I'm an asshole lets go. I thought it was clear, but I was not aware of the law prior. I have not let him off since but I still feel like that was a dick move for the couple to start cursing and stuff. The reason I go there is that it's a block or two from my house and I'm not walking 3 miles to a dog park just for him to poop. I have never and will never let him off in a place where he could easily run off like the street or a front yard.

I’m having a really tough time in the last couple months of my life right now: My mom went through a complicated stem cell transplant and is still sick, used all my savings for medical reasons, car issues, my landlord is suing me. This, following two years filled with other fun events such as: my cousin overdosing, two friends dying, all my grandparents dying, being cheated on, dropping out of grad school, moving a to a new city, &amp; picking up a high-stress position.

This weekend is the funeral for my best friend, and I will be speaking at his funeral. His death hit me very hard, as we were incredibly close for the past seven years. I am incredibly stressed out, especially being the POC for a lot of people attending from out of town.

My boyfriend, as kind as he is, is not a very emotional or attentive person. When my mom was struggling with her treatment, he walled off , leaving me more stressed and feeling abandoned. I know he struggles with knowing how to do boyfriend things, so I asked him on Monday to make an effort to be available and attentive this week till the funeral was over. I knew it was going to be hard for him to do, but I really needed him. He said he would make the effort.

He visited me at work on Tuesday, and later sent me a very loving, and thoughtful email. It made me feel appreciated.

He recorded music with a friend later, so I couldn’t talk to him, &amp; the next day he went surfing and napped all day, so I didn’t hear from him or receive a responses to my messages. I was extra stressed out yesterday because my landlord is harassing me. I became very upset with him after work because I felt like he made the smallest effort (one email) when I asked that he really be with me until the funeral was over. We had a long discussion (I was very angry) and he apologized and said he would make more effort. He’s currently unemployed, so he isn't restrained by time.

Today, he went out again all day and was completely unavailable and spent the day climbing. I was extremely angry that he, again, wasn't available, and said he was being lazy and selfish. I've never asked him to not do an activity for me, and it is just for this week. I’ve accepted that he is not a big texter and isn’t emotional, but asked that he tries this week, and he didn’t, and I feel very let down.

Now I am feeling like I crossed into being an asshole. I basically scolded him about this for 38 entire minutes, calling him names (selfish and lazy), and told him he HAS to make it up. I’m feeling very angry these last few days and I can’t tell if it’s the grief or stress, and really wanted him to just be there for me. He’s unemployed. He could have easily gone climbing next week. We're both big climbers, and I know he could have left in the afternoon, instead of being there for 7 hours. We talked extensively about this yesterday and he did the exact same thing today! But I also feel like I was being very mean.

In a small group of friends I've had for around 3 years we were having some deep conversations. just about files issues and general struggles. mostly the others shared issues with me and i gave my advice, people generally seek my advice as i have been known to give successful life advise but also its just always good to vent and im always happy to help.

I spent most of my life unable to express myself and always kept things in so when they eventually persuaded me into sharing more about myself I felt like i was opening the floodgates. It felt good and healthy for a while and everyone continued sharing. Around a month ago the whole group told me they were uncomfortable with me sharing. I was shocked and tried to listen but it felt difficult to suddenly stop so i broke a few times and recently i have separated myself from the group because i stress them out. the issues we shared were never to demanding we just sought some validation in each other and nothing more.

My partners father passed away after a long and painful battle with cancer. I loved that man dearly like he was my own father. My partner has been a mess and I’ve stayed up day and night just to hold him. I love him so much. 

On the morning of the funeral at around 8am (service was at 2pm), I asked my partner if he needed me for anything, anything at all. Could I do something? Help out? Anything? He just said no but thank you and that he just wanted to process things. 

I said okay and that if he needs me I’ll be in our bedroom (I wanted to give him the living space as his own for now). I sat on the bed and read an e-book about how to support your partner through grief, smashed out a few chapters then decided to clean up my eyebrows a bit. I don’t get them waxed as I have sensitive skin so I just take a small mirror and pluck any excess hairs that pop up. I wasn’t trying to be presentable or care about my appearance at all; I just had nothing else to do in the room as he specifically asked for space and I 110% respect his needs for it. 

He walked into the room as I was plucking a few strays and he completely exploded at me, accusing me of being vain and saying I only cared about myself and my looks. As I knew the pain he was going through I didn’t argue back or say anything, I just sat there and let him take it out on me. He left the apartment for a while then came back and ignored me for the entirety of the service.

Around January 2019 my life changed quite a bit. I cut out toxic people and also gained quite a few new friends. One of these new friends is M. M is around my age and we started seeing each other two or three times a week when meeting other friends too. 

To my problem:

Somehow I managed to fall in love with him and have been feeling like this since last august. Now I haven't fallen in love ever before. I had a few crushes when I was 15 or somewhere around that, but it was never like what I'm feeling now. Unfortunately, my feelings are one sided. Since I'm a good listener, M came up to me and asked for help. He told me, what I've feared for quite some time now: he fell in love is a third friend.

Since then I've tried to avoid M. For example after activities we normally chat, but now I'm quick to leave. I also try to avoid being alone with him and stopped attenting an activity we used to do together. I'm not outright refusing to meet him and we still see each other occasionally, but I think he noticed that I'm acting different now.

595,AmItheAsshole,"We’re moving apartments with our 4 month old child. My wife’s family lived like an hour or so away from us and they offered to babysit for a whole day and even offered to drive our kid back at 5pm the next day. 

We thought it would be great, considering it’s been really hard to pack when your kid’s being a bit needy because they’re teething. 

Anyway, this morning, she messaged me to say that she was thinking that maybe she should keep our kid with them for 2 days instead of 1. I talked to my wife about it and we both agreed that we preferred to have our kid back home as planned, so I responded telling her this. 

She then starts getting a bit difficult first saying that it was just to help, and that we need the help. After declining the offer and thanking her repeatedly, she says that it’s going to be dark when she drives to us and we know how she hates driving in the dark and so on and eventually says that it’s really shitty of us to put them in that position because they’re not young anymore. 

My wife then gets involved and she somehow got wrangled into agreeing to this even though she was kind of like “there’s no point arguing with her” immediately after the call. 

I message her again to say that we talked about it again and I appreciate the offer, but if the driving in the dark thing is such a big issue, we’ll come pick our kid up ourselves. She called my wife and said that she gets the feeling I don’t trust them to look after our kid.

I assure her it isn’t the case and say that she could’ve just directly asked if she wanted to keep our kid for another night. If it was an inconvenience, she should have told us when we initially agreed to this. I told her that I felt like I/we were being manipulated and that it made me slightly uncomfortable. 

I should add that this whole time, we were just communicating very politely to her. While I never told her this, I felt like “if it’s this now, what next?” Because she has done this in the past when it came to certain decisions my wife and I make together. She tends to add her 2cents, but keep telling us over and over as if she wants us to change our decision to fit hers and I hate that I felt that way. It’s what made me uncomfortable.

So she always accuses me of being lethargic and a wet wipe when we're socializing through something she enjoys. If I ask for more frequent breaks and breathers as a compromise for hanging out at malls, she'll initially say ""fine, we can do that"" but never comes through. When we're shopping it's as if she's fueled by some sort of an adrenaline high and won't stop for hours, even if she doesn't end up buying that much in the end.

She'll claim her pace is normal and I'm the slow and disinterested one, holding us behind because I don't try to be invested. But how can I force myself to be invested in hours of something that doesn't excite me?

598,AmItheAsshole,"Background info: Husband and I are 16 years younger than his brother and his wife. We have just managed to downpay a house and have two babies. For the last 5 years, we went from freshly out of college to marriage to kids then house. Money isn't too tight but we do have to watch what we spend on. His brother's family is well off, they spend on the most ridiculous things like a trailer and multiple cars, also Disneyland memberships since they fly there every other month. 

Ever since I met them, every xmas have been us giving them 60 dollars per person on presents (2 adults and 2 kids.) I get nothing and he gets a 5 dollars bag of chocolates that he can't eat. The nieces were young then, so whatever, we didn't care. 

Fast forward to now, we have a 22 months and a 4 months old. The babies got used regift things for xmas. I still got nothing, he still got a bag of chocolate. I packed extra presents so our toddler didn't feel left out or anything. 

Anyhow, a month ago, we went to one of the nieces' bday, we been doing this for years. Still 60 dollars present as usual. Our kid got there, super excited to see other kids. Except for said kids ignored her. 6 kids in a room, and my toddler was the one sitting alone. She tried running after them but was ignored and ran from so she just silently sits, watch them from afar. Their mom then grabbed a random xmas tree ornament and gave to her, saying she should have it. Then one niece came saying that it was hers. We left that dusty old thing back there before leaving anyhow.

Still okay, we are used to it. However, they sent a text, saying we should let our kid tag on with theirs for their bday in March. This is grating my every nerves. They can't even bother to let the baby have her own special day. She is only 2 then. Like can you not?! Their bdays are also a month apart =_ =

Would I be an ass for declining and just have a small thing just at home for just us?? I really don't want my kids sucked into their take and take more relationship. I also want to start giving them less and stop attending the nieces' birthdays. It was toleratable before when it was just us, but now that we have babies and money is tighter and emotional issues that might develop, I rather not... Going to those parties = us not talking to them because age gap and our babies being tired and alone. The drive is also an hour away.

TLDR: essentially we been giving 240 usd to a family of 4 (they make 3x what we make) every xmas and 120 usd for their bdays yearly. We get 5 dollars single bag of chocolates for xmas and no bday attendance or gifts back. Their kids ignore and isolate our toddler who wants to play with them. Toddler got used books and toys for xmas and cousins hate them because parents gave old things to our toddler. 

Can I just give equal xmas present values and stop attending the bday parties?",WIBTA for not going to birthdays and giving expensive gifts anymore? TLDR at bottom.

For some context: I am currently doing year 10 again since I failed like 8 of my classes last year.
I now am a way better student and almost all of my classes are As and Bs. (Important)

I have two friends in my class who I've known for only about 4-5 months now and only see in school. However they don't really care about school and aren't really good students (not paying attention, not doing homework ect.) 
I don't really care about that, but one of them (N) who I'm not really that close, just talks so much and is pretty annoying.

Maths is the subject I struggle most with and I even have another Maths class to help me get better. In both of them she sits next to me and I just can't really focus.

The other one (F) is way more close with me but she keeps stressing how less she cares about all of that shit etc. Again - her choice.

602,AmItheAsshole,"4 months ago I was flying to visit a friend in a nearby city. I sat next to a guy on the plane and we started chatting &amp; he seemed like an okay dude. He said he worked for a local hotel chain and let’s all meet up for drinks when we get to the city and he can get us a discount at the bar. Both my friend and I were new to the city so it seemed like a nice plan. I mentioned my boyfriend a few times during the conversation on the plane and don’t think I gave any hint of more than a friendly hangout. 

My friend and I go over to the hotel bar later that night and met up with him and his friend. It ended up being quite awkward and the conversation wasn’t going well, so we left after a couple drinks. I tried to pay my tab but he insisted on paying for my and my friend’s drinks (as in he got up from our table and intercepted the bartender). I told him I’d like to pay for my own drinks and offered him cash as we were leaving and he refused to accept. 

We didn’t seem to get along well and I wasn’t interested in continuing a friendship.

- Just broke up
- Current tenancy ends in 3 weeks
- She has no family here to fall back to

Just broke up, happened mutually in an argument as per. We hadn’t found a new place together yet, and since we now broke up.. I will look for my own place. She says that she only moved out of a family home - which she can’t return back to - so that she can live with me and expected to do so for the rest of her life. 

Ok, so.. she says she won’t be able to afford a flat on her own, neither will I, so it sounds like a room in a house share is the most viable option. She doesn’t like this, states she will not downgrade her lifestyle to afford a small flat or live in a room share. Claims I am also responsible for her in this situation and is demanding that I live/share with her in a new place together.

605,AmItheAsshole,"Long time reddit lurker, but made an account to post this.  I’m very conflicted here. 

I‘m a college senior living in an off-campus apartment with a roommate who graduated a few years ago.  A few days ago, my roommate texted asking if I was ok with her parents leaving their dog at our apartment for 2 weeks while they went on vacation.  I told her that was no problem as long as it wasn’t a nuisance.  
Her dog is a 13-year-old toy poodle with no teeth— I figured, how much trouble could it cause? 

My roommate leaves for work every morning at 6:45am and I usually don’t wake up until around 9am.  On the first morning the dog was here, the minute my roommate left he started yapping bloody murder.  It was ear-piercing and didn’t stop.  I texted her asking how to get him to stop barking and she said that if I play with him, he’ll get tired out and rest.  Annoyed and groggy, I played with him for 15 minutes and he seemed to finally get quiet, but the second I went into my room again, he started barking and whining.  This made me extremely tired and unable to focus during class. 

This continued for the next few days and finally yesterday morning I couldn’t take it anymore.  The yapping was so bad it gave me a piercing headache.  I moved it’s doggy bed, food, water, and pee pad outside to the balcony along with the dog.  I even gave it a heated blanket that I plugging into the outside outlet.  I let the dog back inside when I woke up 2 hours later.  It worked pretty well and the dog didn’t seem to mind too badly.  Sure, he kept barking for a bit, but it was muffled enough that I could finally go back to sleep.  And when I went to bring him inside, he was sound asleep cuddled in his bed.  I figured this was a solid system and put him outside again this morning. 

Without my knowledge, my roommate was feeling sick and decided to leave work.  She got home and saw her dog sleeping outside. She banged on my door and started screaming saying that it was not ok for me to do that.  She said it was borderline animal cruelty and her dog could’ve frozen to death (which is impossible because it was 38 degrees and I gave him a heated blanket) or he could’ve gotten stolen (which is also impossible because we live on the 5th floor). 

I reminded her that I only okayed the dog staying with us as long as he wasn’t a nuisance, but he is.  And I am going to do what I need to do in order to get enough sleep so my day isn’t totally miserable.  Anyway, she’s upset, but I didn’t know what else to do.  I didn’t think putting the dog outside with all of its necessities for only 2 hours was that bad.  Plenty of people leave the dogs outside for much longer.  I don’t think a yapping dog should ruin someone’s day.  My boyfriend thinks I’m wrong and I shouldn’t make decisions using someone else’s dog. 

Anyway, AITA?

Edit 1:  So my roommate and I came to an agreement.  She’s going to take her dog in with her to work in the mornings and then bring him back in the afternoon since she comes home for lunch everyday.  I apologized for putting the dog outside without her permission.  She also apologized for not telling me about her dog’s obsessive barking.  As I’ve said in some of the comments, I’ve never had a dog and I knew that they barked when their owner left, but I figured they would get over it in maybe 10 minutes? I didn’t know some dogs barked for hours.

Edit 2: I wanted to address the things that I have been condemned for the most in the comments which is “38 degrees is too cold for a smaller dog” and “dogs bark, you should’ve known that.”

As I’ve said in some of the comments, I’ve never had a dog in my life.  I figured that 38 with a heated blanket would be more than ok.  I sometimes walk by a dog park on my way to a friend’s house and I see dogs out in the 30s-40s , so I figured it would be fine.  I also watched the dog for a bit once I put it out there and it didn’t appear cold and wasn’t shivering.  If I was wrong, I’m sorry. 

People have also been condemning me for “not know that dogs bark”.  Of course I know that they bark, but for what I’ve experienced, dogs seem to bark maybe 10 minutes after the owner leaves, gives up, and chills out.  I didn’t know that 20% of dogs have separation anxiety issues and that my roommates dog is one of that 20% (she didn’t disclose that to me).  

Although I certainly didn’t handle the situation well, I think it’s kind of unfair that reddit expects non-dog owners to know everything about dogs.",AITA for putting my roommate’s dog outside while I slept?

She replies that she “just may” have the flu, because she never got her shot, but doesn’t like getting them anyway. Plus, she says, she’s not taking time off work to go to the doctor and use her “vacation” time to do so.

613,AmItheAsshole,"Here’s the situation: 
Sorry for the book. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My sister wants to be a doctor. She failed Gen Chem1 last semester with an F. 
My parents hired a tutor for her a month into last semester and she still failed horribly. 

This semester, my parents have begged me to work with her. I started working with her over Christmas break. I am currently in graduate school in a related field, so I have taken and passed these classes. 

School has barely been in session and she has already failed a quiz over basic concepts. When I try to go over things with her, she seems to get the steps, but won’t take the time to memorize equations, poly atomic ions, periodic trends, etc. 

These are things she needs to have a firm grasp on, so she can understand material presented to her later in the semester. When she told me that she failed a quiz, I asked her if she had gone over the stuff we tried to learn for it. She said that she “got it” and didn’t feel the need to review. 

I’m frustrated. I’m taking time out of my already busy schedule and she won’t make the effort to study. 

I told her that maybe being a doctor is out if her reach. Things are only going to get harder and she can’t do the easy stuff, she should be more realistic about her career. Being a doctor isn’t for everybody. 

She claimed that she is being realistic, and knows that this is what she wants to do. She got really upset and ran to tell my parents. They can’t believe that I would “put my sister down” and fill her head with doubt. 

I told them that I was almost positive that she would fail again, or get a C at best because she won’t study and learn the material. They don’t want me to tutor anymore (which is no skin off my back tbh) and my sister is ignoring me. 

After some time, sister is considering dropping the class. Which I think she should do. My parents are angry because they said that I caused my sister to “lower her aspirations” and that a good sister would lift her up and encourage her. Am I in the wrong here? AITA?

615,AmItheAsshole," Ok, a bit of backstory: My former best friend is a very energetic,  creative and fun person, when she is in a good mood. One of the things I  liked the most about her is, that you could talk to her for hours,  planning fun stuff, while she stays super motivated the whole time.  
 But sadly she is also a little bit selfish, has some strong opinions and  is easily triggered when something doesnt work out like she wants to.   
It happened more than once that she started a huge fight over something very minor, that could have been talked about in a calm maner...  


I on the other side am quite the opposite. I am way more quiet, peaceful and even shy sometimes. Getting attention ( especially negative attention) stresses me out to a point that I break down and hide in my bedroom for hours, and it is very important to me how other people see me.   


Those incidents where she started fights in new found friendgroups, projectgroups or just when we where talking to random people in some onlinegames happened frequently enough for me to feel miserable for 90% of the time. I felt like I was always runing after my best friend to calm her down, trying to explain and apologize to the other people in those groups  and just seeing the projects I was looking forward to breaking appart because of open fights or constant ranting behind the back of others.  
About 3 monthes ago my internal stress reached a new high, so I formed the plan to take a break from her. I woke up in the morning, cryed, thought it through and then, stilly crying while typing wrote a message for her, where I explained that I cant do this anymore and that I need a break. I also added that I would miss her and that I would try to get in contact with a psychiatrist, to fix my stress problems, before we can be close friends again. And then I blocked her, left all discordservers we had in common and hid again in my bed.

After this a mutual friend kind of panniked and distanced himself from her too, because he feared that he could loose my boyfriend, who was a very close friend of his. But he and my former best friend have already spoken about it and  reconciled. 

Since that day I told our mutual friends that I do better now, but to be honest... There wasnt a single day where I hadnt thought about this. Everytime I get remembered of her I regret that I have done this and I was kind of hoping that she felt the same way and wished for me to reach out to her.  
But our mutual friends tell me that it seems to be quite the opposite for her. They told me more than once that she still calls me a traitor and keeps on making comments about the discordserver, I made to keep in touch with my other friends.

I never agreed to be there forever, take care of my parents when they get old, and be the person they want me to be.

No wife or children involved, and nobody depending on me.

617,AmItheAsshole,"So my (21M) friend (21F) was dating this guy (21M) ever since she started school (we're seniors). She never had any issues with him outside of her getting restless about ""settling down"" and wanting to explore more, and she said that he didn't display any character flaws that made her dislike him or cause issues in the relationship.

Well, she met a new guy over Christmas break who she was really infatuated with. A couple days later she dumped her bf on their 3 year anniversary for the guy she'd just met, after already making plans for the date. She said her ex was completely blindsided.

She asked me for my opinion and I said that I thought they were both better off. She asked why I thought he was, and I told her that with everything I knew about him, he deserved someone loyal that loved him enough to overlook passing infatuations, and that it wasn't her. 

She took this as criticism, and said that ""you can't control attraction"" and that ""she's trying to focus on loving herself"". I kinda think these are ridiculous excuses, but made it clear that I'm not judging and just saying that it's better for him that she leave now than after they moved in together (they had plans to in a couple months).

My GF (22F) said she wouldn't have been so blunt with something that wasn't her business, but I've never been one to bullshit my friends, and I was asked for my opinion without offering it.

tl;dr- I said that my friend's ex was better off without her because she left him for someone she just met out of the blue. Didn't mean to sound judgy but I think she took it that way. AITA?

Edit: I’ve been reading some responses and wanted to add some clarity to stuff I hadn’t really explained.

1. She’d say stuff about having doubts like maybe once or twice a year and then it’d go away fairly quickly. 

2. I supported them breaking up for the reasons I expressed- that they clearly wanted different things and that she’d had her whole faith in her relationship rocked by meeting someone new. I meant “you’re both better off” as support. It wasnt meant discouragingly. I genuinely felt that he would be better off for the reasons I gave her. So when she asked, I said as much.",AITA for being blunt with my [21M] friend [21F] when she dumped her bf of 3 years for a guy she just met?
618,AmItheAsshole,"My son is in the third-grade and has autism, but is functional. He has issues staying on task and socializing. He goes to a private school so we pay for Seth out of our own pocket. He is our fourth school aide for our son because the other people quit (they said he was too much) so we're happy that everything has been going well for the last two years.

Because Seth is NOT a school employee, he cannot park in the parking lot. He has to find street parking and it can be hard because the school is in a densely populated area. Sometimes people have to park three or four blocks away and/or move their car to different spots throughout the day or you will get towed.

Our son had an incident towards the end of the day. Seth usually leaves at 3PM, but stayed to discuss with me and the teacher that last about a half-hour. The next day, Seth mentioned that his car got towed and he had to take an Uber to a towing yard, pay to get his car released and has to pay a ticket. I wasn't sure why he told me this, but he said it was because he had parked in a ""no parking after 3PM."" He was so caught up with dealing with our son and the meeting that it slipped his mind about the parking restriction. I think he was asking me to help pay for it. 

My thing is that he knows about the parking situation after two years and that was just his being careless. I don't want to pay someone else's parking ticket. We pay him pretty good as it is. I get the meeting was at the end of the day, but it something he should have thought about so I played dumb and was all like ""sorry bro!""",WIBTA if I didn't offer to pay my son's aide's towing?

It's a 4/5 hour drive, he told me on the phone that he made a point to not mention it this week so it didn't stress me out. I in turn assumed that he would have mentioned it, or understood that I wasn't feeling well and couldn't make that 4+ hour trek on a Friday afternoon, after work, with a full workday on Monday.

I should also mention that we would be staying at a house that he rents in another state, so it wasn't like he paid for a room, an air bob etc. I expressed to him that a few weeks would be better, and that I can properly prepare and notify work. It also helps with my anxiety and moods....

620,AmItheAsshole,"  

I have two adult children, a boy (22) and a girl (26). I always told them growing up to never depend on their partners for contraception and to always be prepared on their own. For my daughter, that meant being on her own form and bringing condoms. For my son, it meant bringing condoms and insisting on using them, even if his partner swore up and down she was on the pill. I had heard far too many stories of people being tricked into having kids (on both ends, not just girls or guys doing it to their partners) before they were ready. Heck, even without trickery, it’s always good to be doubly protected in case their partner’s form fails. My kids always agreed with me.

My son is now in a pretty serious relationship and I do very much like his girlfriend. Recently, he mentioned to me that she said something about having an implant which was good because he didn’t have to worry. I told him “No, you should always have a backup.” My son went into statistics about the implant and I told him he still needed to be cautious on his end. What if it fell out? Is he prepared to have kids right now? (Both are finishing up their degrees, with plans for masters, my son has said he doesn’t want kids until his mid-30s) I also added, “You haven’t seen this implant, you don’t know that exists and you need to protect yourself.”

My son got mad and said that I didn’t know what I was talking about. Now we haven’t spoken for a few days. My husband thinks I overstepped. Did I?","AITA for telling my son he needs to use protection, even though he swears his girlfriend is using it?"
621,AmItheAsshole,"Back for a second post about the same work place only different coworker. I decided on this subreddit because it seems my coworkers besides him are split on if I’m the asshole or not.  

So, I’m a manager at a generic fast food place. Because I’m so young, (19f) most of my night shift crew is older than me. I don’t mind, as night shift tends to be way more lax than the morning or afternoon shift. 

This one coworker we will call Steven is much older than me. I can hear him from the front all the time. And so can the customers. Sometimes it’s hard to realize how loud you’re being when you’re surrounded by things loud- so I get it. But I’ve had to warn him several times they guests have made comments about it.

Awhile ago we were pretty dead,  but I had a customer in drive. While I was handing out her drinks, very loudly from the back Steven started talked about a very erotic website about animation characters and what he wanted to do to said animated characters. The woman got wide eyed and made a comment about it. I was the one who had to apologize to her. 

Once she left I head into the back and try and talk to him explaining how she heard everything he said and he needs to be quieter. He said he didn’t know her so he didn’t care. He refused to go to the office with me, and he refused to listen to me and said I wasn’t his boss. 

Because there was nothing I could do, I wrote a note to my boss about the whole interaction, as well as all the warnings I had given him prior and my other manager had given him. It was clear by the next day I showed up he had been talked to, for the moment I came in he said: “Woah guys got to not talk about anything adult or bad back here. Fun police just arrived.”

I begin to notice he ignores what I’m saying more and more and tends to redo things I do or when he asks for help say he doesn’t need it when I offer. Whatever. I don’t mind much- less work for me. 

Today however when I was cleaning off an ice cream scoop- I saw an already lit cigarette. While it was put out, it caused ash to go a bit everywhere on the plastic container it was set on. Plus it was causing an intense smoking smell in the back. 

I quickly messaged my boss with a picture of it and asked the backline who’s it was. Steven was quick to show his brand of cigarettes and throw the other way away- and then covered that with mushroom sauce so I couldn’t dig it out.

I went back up to the front, but due to his loud voice I just heard him rambling about how it wasn’t a big deal and it could have just been an accident and how I was an asshole for accusing him of being the person smoking since two other people working night shift smoke. The other back liner agrees I’m being an asshole. 

So, am I the asshole for being strict (apparently too strict) on work place policies?

At the time this happened it’s two hours before our local supermarket closes. I do live close but it’s icy, cold, and honestly really bad for my asthma for me to be outside taking that walk (don’t have a car). I don’t want to go out for nothing so I call them. Here’s how it went

Her: **obviously annoyed tone*: Supermarket 

Me: Hi, I’m really sorry I know it’s very late but wanted to know if you could please check if something is in stock for me, it’s urgent 

Her: ugh (yeah, really she did that) you know it’s really really late. Like super late...

Me: yes, I know it’s late but could you please help

Her: there are tons of people here and it’s super late, I mean there’s like nobody here (seriously, which is it)

Me:...

Her: well what I mean is there’s tons of customers, the store is packed and I’m the only person working (expect me to believe that at 10:30 pm, I shop there all the time, the store is normally dead by 9)

Me: ok well could you just answer a question real quick please? Do you guys sell puppy pads by chance?

Her: No, we don’t ok. We don’t sell them and never have so just go to Walmart or something



Now I asked her about puppy pads because I needed something else in the pet aisle (not puppy pads but related) and I know for a fact, because I was just there this week, that they sell puppy pads. Matter of fact, they even sell their *own brand* of puppy pads. I wanted to test her to see if she’d help at all and it pissed me off that she lied like that.

I told her she was a big help and hung up. But I was seething on the inside. I didn’t want to go to Walmart (24 hours) because the buses stop running soon and that’s the only way I’d get there and home.

I work in customer service and no matter how annoyed I may be I don’t act like that...especially when a customer is polite for a change and doesn’t start a call screaming and insulting me. Part of me regrets not calling her out on her BS right then and there. I know it’s petty and it may make me seem like a Karen but WIBTA if I make a complaint about poor customer service? I didn’t get her name as she was so short with me but they typically only have 2-3 people working up front this late so I’d just generally tell them; hey this is the experience I had last night.

626,AmItheAsshole,"So a few months ago I started renting a server for my brother and my and his friends to play on. I am the only one paying for the server since it is only about $50 a year, though my brother's friend has paid $15 to help out with the cost (his brother and his girlfriend were also invited since they are also friends with my brother). My friend had not paid anything. 

Anyway, a few weeks ago my friend wanted me to invite his friend K to the server. I have met K a few times and do not like him. He makes sexist and racist jokes most of the time and I just don't like being around him. I have told my friend a few times that I do not like K and would prefer to not be around him, so if my friend invites me to do something I ask if K will be there and if he is, I typically decline. This has never upset my friend before and he often tells me that he doesn't like K either. So when my friend asked if I would invite K to the server I was kind of upset. He knows I don't like K. My friend then brings up how my brother's friend's are a part of the server so I should invite K. I responded saying I don't like K so I didn't want him on the server. This is when he goes off and tells me to go fuck myself. He then unfriended me on everything and has not talked to me.

I talked to my brother about it (he also knows K) and he agrees that having K on the server would have been annoying and he would most likely intentionally destroy things. I feel very confused about the whole situation. I lost a friend I had for over 15 years because I didn't invite K to the server. I feel like the asshole, but my brother and other friends disagree.

631,AmItheAsshole,"I am a 24, full time working mom with 2 young children under the age of 3. My husband works full time, my brother stays home with my children to save on childcare costs while he goes to school online and my sister works full time in the next county over. 

We technically all live together, but she works Mon - Fri 45 minutes away with no license, so she lives with my mother during the week (mom and her work for the same healthcare system in that town) and either takes public transport or I bring her home for weekends. It did not start out this way; she was living with us full time but accepted a better job there.

Lately, she's been opting to not come home at all due to our disagreements regarding expectations of her when she is in my home. It boils down to helping out around the house (take trash out if it's full, load dishwasher if you see the sink is full, etc) and assisting with the children (diapering, bed and nap times, feeding, etc).

She consistently comes here, lays around ignoring the children and ignoring when I request for her help in something I wouldn't expect her to do (i.e. folding kids laundry). She doesn't protest doing it. She will just do it when she feels like it, often weeks after I originally asked or I give up and do it anyways. 

My perspective is that during the week, she has 1 responsibility ; going to work. Nothing else is expected or asked of her at my mother's home. ( Her share of rent is 1/6th of the total rent and a utility. She does not pay rent at my mother's home, but does chip in for food there.)

We're three girls, two have been friends for awhile and we became friends before moving in together. 
We live in a three bedroom one bathroom basement apartment in Toronto. 
I have a dog and they both have older cats. 
I work full time and they're both students. 
I like to keep things clean and tidy, that's how I was raised to clean up right after myself and not leave dishes in the sink. 
For the past few months we've been living together and I've let a majority of things slide but I'm at my wits ends.

Jackets and scarves and hats will be left on the kitchen table or thrown on the couch when we have a coat rack is closer to the door then the other two. 
I also got a new coffee maker last week and one will make coffee and leave it on for who knows how long and not clean it when she's done.
I can't remember the last time either of them has actually cleaned the apartment or even the bathroom. It usually takes them weeks to change their car litter and I'm embarrassed to have friends or company over because in my opinion are apartment is usually a mess and stinks of cat urine.

We spilt the grocery bill 60/40 for these nights. (Me paying more.) The rest of the week she either cooks meat dishes or orders out. I don’t mind when she cooks any other meat- but seafood makes me nauseous. I can’t stand the sight or smell. It’s a small apartment so even if I stay in my room I can smell it. 

So, I asked her if she could just give me a heads up if she was planning on making a seafood dish. That way I could be out of the apartment. She got a bit upset and told me it wasn’t practical for me to be out of the apartment for hours, and where would I go, and that she didn’t always know what she was going to be making until that night. I told her that there were plenty of places I could go- my 24 hour gym, window shop at the mall, go out to eat somewhere, sit and do work and the cafe we go to, etc. I really don’t mind getting out of the house for a few hours while she cooks and cleans up.

I approached and said “excuse me” and they didn’t say anything they were loudly talking so I said louder “oh sorry can I get by?” And they looked and one was like “oh just a second” and continued on with their convo and didn’t move. I waited a good 5-10 seconds and she didn’t move so I got a little impatient and just moved one of the strollers like two feet ahead and to the side up against the aisle so I can get by down the middle. 

I walked out and was almost around the corner when one of them came to me screaming bloody murder “excuse me! Excuse me what the fuck do you think you’re doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?!” I’m like “what? I just moved it because I couldn’t get by” “who the fuck do you think you are?! How dare you touch my stroller with my child in it how dare you!!” I’m just like lol wtf “I moved it like two feet lady just to squeeze by you guys blocked the entire aisle” “so why don’t you just go to another aisle and go around??” And I say” what are you fucking kidding me? Just don’t be inconsiderate in the first place and let people pass” at this point she’s going apeshit and yelling and I’m speaking in a calm but firm tone, I’m not yelling back because I really don’t want to fight or escalate.

You scared the shit out of my kid you asshole!” And I point out that no, her kid is probably scared and crying because she suddenly lost it and is screaming at the top of her lungs.

He has a short temper and a disgusting attitude about everything. He has something negative to say about everything, he rolls his eyes and scoffs at EVERYTHING. He was bothered by them crossing the street too slow I guess and started saying “ughh can they hurry up! They look like illegals they probably don’t even have papers and are mooching off the government with all those kids!” I said “ why do you say that? Do you know them?” He says “no but that’s what they all look like at my work” He’s an immigration officer. I said “ ok if you don’t know them then why would you comment on their immigration status?” And he said “because I have experience in my job and that’s what they all look like.” I said “wow I’m sure if some people would say the same thing about you if they saw you.” He’s a dark skinned Mexican, we’re all Mexican in this story. 

He went off and starting talking about all his years experience in his field of work and how he just knows by looking at them.

And I’m like wow I’m so done with this man toddler. So since he’s coming to visit again I am totally against hanging out with him at all because I’m not the type of person to just be quiet. I told my husband it’s not fair that he can spew all this hate and share his backwards opinions and nobody can say anything against him. Everyone is expected to be quiet in order to appease him and keep the mood nice. I don’t think I’m the one that needs to change and be quiet in order to not piss him off when he says dumb things. 

SO WIBTA if I told my husband that I do not want to spend time with his father that’s coming to visit because I want to avoid confrontation?

636,AmItheAsshole,"So this involves me and two friends. One we'll call S, the other we'll call M. Last year I started dating someone outside my friend group. We'll call him X.  He and S have never interacted except when she did this. S gave him what we call ""The Talk"" which is basically like ""If you hurt them I'll murder you in your sleep e.c.t"". Now X and S have never talked to each other and this random girl coming up to him, two days after he started seeing me and giving him a death threat which sounded serious scared him shitless. He was too scared to bring it up for months and because of this he broke up with me over summer break, eight months after we started dating because he was too scared to do it when he could be seeing her. 

Now M recently got into a relationship with someone we'll call C. C is one of my friends but S does not know who he is. S has never even interacted with him. While we were eating lunch and M broke the news to S that she was dating someone. S's immediate reaction was to find C and give him ""the talk"" stopped her to tell her that it might not be a good idea because she does not know the guy (C is very introverted and not open to people he does not know). I also talked about how my relationship dragged on because X was too afraid to break up with me.

M's final decision was that she didn't want S to give C the talk. After the weekend S was avoiding us during lunch and I asked her why. She is mad at me because I'm blaming the timing of my breakup on her scaring my boyfriend. She also said that she is mad because it was due to me that M said no to her giving C the talk.

What she texted me:

""You're getting involved in other people's business. What happens between Me and M is between us. and don't blame me because your boyfriend didn't have the guts to break up with you earlier. You have problems recognizing that X is someone on his own who has his own problems and the fact you are still blaming me for that and not seeing that he had no feelings for you is upsetting to me""

637,AmItheAsshole,"I had an ""argument"" with my dad about getting a physical for my sport, but it mainly consisted of him just telling at me for being so rushed about getting it done (it's due in two weeks but I wanted it done earlier so I wouldn't have to worry about it). I'm actively listening to him while being calm but I was extremely irritated the whole time. We go back and forth and I start stuttering because my mind is racing and I can't keep up with what I want to say. He starts railing me about how me and my mom's side have this problem and that all I have to do is just think and enunciate. This goes in for a while as he keeps repeating himself and yelling at me about the physical. 

By the end of it, I'm angry and judge want to be alone to think. I start throwing darts at a dartboard to get my frustration out and my dad (I guess he wanted to apologize) walks behind and gives me a hug. The hug was understandable but the problem was that he started to forcefully push my face towards his shoulder with his hand behind my head. I hate having my face pushed against something; it's just so uncomfortable and I don't see why anyone else would it. The only time having my face pressed against his shoulder would be if I was crying or depressed but I was doing neither, I was just frustrated. I then proceed to push him away from me and tell him that I'd rather not have him push my face against his shoulder.

638,AmItheAsshole,"I have very tight friend group of 5 at college. For our spring break our freshman year, we took a train to Canada. It was a good time and we wanted to make annual trips for Spring Break if we all could afford it. I'll call my friends, M, H, F. We are in a groupchat since our first year and always are talking and having a good time.

A year ago F got into a relationship. When that happened, her contact with the rest of us dropped. She never left the GC but never talked and seldom talked even if we asked her a question in it or in private chat. She rarely hung out with us for a year because she just spent time with her bf, even if we invited her or it was quick. I remember we hung out maybe twice in the last year. During that meeting, F said itd be fun to do a vacation again like Canada. We all agreed and said we'd prob talk about it when the time came in the GC or something. After that though, F never really talked much in the GC. M, H and I didn't make a huge fuss and didn't try and exclude her but stopped making a huge effort to hang out.

Now we are planning our Spring Break trip and its a big one to Europe. Its a ridiculously cheap airplane ticket and I have family that we could stay with. We made loose plans for it a few months ago and told anyone in our friendgroup interested to meet up. F never responded and the GC wasnt flooded with texts at all so the message of the meeting would be the first thing she saw if she opened up the GC. We made a few more texts in the GC about meeting up for the vacation plans. A couple weeks later we have solid plans and booked tickets + the airbnb for the trip. 

Recently, F and her bf broke up and shes more active in the GC. She asked about the vacation texts and was excited for the whole group to go. We told her we already made those plans a long time ago and booked everything. She was very upset saying that she was looking forward to the trip with her friends and said we should've texted her personally or went to her dorm.

639,AmItheAsshole,"For context, I'm a college student who is taking an extremely heavy course load with the main heavy-hitters in terms in classes. I am also the under the legal age for drinking which my roommates seem to think means that I can play DD, weekdays and weekends, and that I can stay up and take care of their drunk selves (basically, when they are drunk and have friends over, it's like taking care of 3-6 drunk toddlers in the terrible twos). 

I have told them repeatedly that I don't want to stay up and have even gone to the lengths of drinking by myself (it's only a wine of glass if even that, but enough that I have a legitimate excuse for staying in and not getting behind the wheel of a car). In addition, it's usually between 2-5am when they are calling and my classes start at 9am.

I stay up with the lights off, or wake up when they come back in (they are super loud even with headphones on) to make sure they get home safe but I find it extremely annoying that they are treating me like a live-in DD and one has started to get snippety with me when she calls asking even though I told her beforehand that I'm not driving them back. My thought process is that if they asked me and I knew that I would be staying up then that would be one thing but they refuse to find other drivers or even have one of the group act as a designated driver which I find to be stupid AITA?

640,AmItheAsshole,"It's a bit of a long story, so buckle in. My friend, we will call him Vikram, recently decided to no longer be my friend. In December, he cussed me out and called me an asshole. We did get into a disagreement, where I removed him from a discord server after he threatened to delete it. I invited him back but he said he didn't want to since a mutual was apparently an asshole. I tried to side with the mutual by prompting Vikram to apologize, which caused Vikram to say, ""burn in hell, go fuck yourself asshole."" I asked him to explain what I did wrong, since I was (and still am) unsure as to how such a small thing spiraled so far out of control. I was met with no answer. We had also been working on a film project at our club. I asked him if we would still be working together on this project, but he said he had already found another cameraman (within a few hours of our previous interaction). He has since blocked me in all forms of communication and refuses to even make eye contact with me in real life. However, I am aware that he is still making the short film we were working on. The premise and most of the plot was my idea, and I had written multiple scenes (though I am unsure if those scenes are still being used). Vikram's plan is to show it to our entire school. However, I think I can email the person who reviews the movies and deems them as appropriate in order to have the film not be shown without giving at least some credit to me.

641,AmItheAsshole,"About a month ago I let my friend borrow my car to go visit her BF because hers was getting repairs. Well the other day I got 3 parking tickets in the mail from the town where he lives (I've never been there in my life).. well she is totally denying it and saying the dates dont match up (they totally do) and refusing to pay for the violations. Her parents support her so she could absolutely afford it.. but they don't know about the BF and shit would hit the fan if they found out. The $130 would be a huge dent out of my funds that I cant afford at the moment and I feel like she has left me no choice but to ask her parents to pay it. Or is that a huge overreaction and I just need to accept the crap hand fate as dealt me here and eat the $130??

Edit:

**UPDATE***** This shit is crazy...

So it very quickly got back to her that everyone thinks shes a jerk off for what she did to me and lying about it by telling everyone she was paying it when she replaced her lost debt card. This is the shortended version of the novel of a text I recieved a few hours ago...

""OMGgggg please stop complaining to everyone about the stupid money. I told you yesterday that I had to take it out in small amounts so my parents wouldnt notice. And I cant believe you would ever tell them about (BF), you know I'd never be able to see him again. Like all this just over a parking ticket, it's not that deep. Are you going to (friends house we were all supposed to study together) later? I'll have it for you there and then I never want to talk about this ever again. In the meantime please stop telling everyone I'm a thief""...

""Thief"" lol that word never ever came out of my mouth. And the last text I have before this is ""I promise to you there were no tickets on your windshield that morning""... this bitch is the CEO of spinning things in her favor, its hilarious how she finally agreed once it was out of her control. All it took actually was one of her BF's friends from finding out the truth, she doesn't want him to know she is a lying spoiled brat.

BUT TURNS OUT she ditched the study session because ""everyone is mad at her now"" like a little 10 year old. So I text her that I'm coming to her house once we finish the assignment for the money. I think she might have taken that as a threat because as soon as I ring the doorbell and her sister opens the door I see here come FLYING down the stairs like a bat out of hell. Mind you this is the first time we've spoken in person since she denied the tickets were hers and said some pretty not nice.things to one another. This bitch puts on the phoniest voice in front of her mom... we go up to her room and I'm not kidding when I say this starts breaking down crying saying it's all my fault everyone hates her now (in reality nobody cared and moved on after like an hour) because I was too impatient.

I was hit with a bad depressive episode that lasted a couple of months, right when I was getting better and more social with my friends. I spend nearly all day with one of my friends (school,) and when I get depressed, I isolate myself, shutting up and being unable to talk to anyone without necessity, like in class participation. this puts a strain on my friend, who's very social but also reactive to things like me going quiet for days and weeks on end, so in turn she got upset when I went though my episode. that part of my life is over now but my other friend, who is best friends with the aforementioned friend, claims I ruined their friendship (first friend only wanted to discuss what was wrong with me whenever they hung out,) and made the first friend miserable. i told her that it's not my fault that she pokes her nose into our business and thinks that the world revolves around her, and that it's my other friends fault for wanting to talk about me when I wasn't there to control the conversation. she responded that I was a massive bitch and I said the same went for her.

643,AmItheAsshole," I (28F) have a friend (26F), lets call her Carly. We both work 12+ hour shifts, however the days I have off she is usually working. Carly rescued a dog about four months ago and I offered to let Carly’s dog hang out with me on my days off, for free, because I find it really sad how Carly will lock her sweet pup in a crate for roughly 14 hours. I also have a dog and a large dog door; so our dogs just frolic around together, inside and outside, at their leisure. Carly also passes by my house on the way to her place of employment, so it’s really a win-win for her. The only thing Carly has to do is be responsible enough to wake up 5-10 minutes earlier, so she has an adequate amount of time to drop her dog off on her way to work, **that’s literally all I ask for**. Carly has never offered to pay me, and she does not supply me with dog food, toys, or treats.

Anyways, 6 days ago Carly and I agreed that she would drop her dog off on Wednesday (yesterday). However, Carly unexpectedly acquired a new roommate who is willing to let the dog out to potty while Carly works. I contacted Carly yesterday asking if she was still bringing the dog by or if the new roommate was watching her. She said she would drop the dog off “if she has time.” Whatever that means, as Carly could simply plan accordingly and set her alarm. Carly text me yesterday saying she was running late and could not bring the pup by, but since I was somewhat in the area (she knew I had plans to visit a friend that lived about 15 minutes from her place) she asked if I would just ""stop by"" to let the dog out for a few minutes. I told her I should be able to. Fast forward, as I was leaving my other friends house, I unexpectedly received a phone call from my mother who was having a panic attack. I completely forgot Carly had asked me to let her dog out and only realized this after pulling into my garage. Carly lives 25 minutes away but I knew her new roommate would luckily be home in 3 hours (which means the dog would be in the crate for 10 hours at that point), so I text her apologizing that I had forgotten to stop by and explained the situation.

Carly did not respond to me yesterday, but she text me today saying she was “really upset” with me for not letting her dog out. Now, when I am working and unavailable Carly leaves her dog in the crate for 14 hours anyway, so wtf? I really do feel bad but ultimately her dog is not my responsibility and why am I expected to go out of my way when I am always watching her dog for free? I should mention I also told another friend I would babysit yesterday (for free, apparently I just *love* doing things for free), so driving back was really not an option at that point unless I took the little one with me. The situation would never have happened if Carly would have just dropped her dog off in the first place. AITA for this? Should I seriously have driven back to her place?

My younger(13F) sister loves them too, and she is always too lazy and stingy to buy for herself that she would steal from me. When she does steal, she would take the whole box of 6 and finish them before I realized they are missing.

647,AmItheAsshole,"Backstory: I’m roommates w/ my best friend, tight since kindergarten.

Few months ago I started going on dates &amp; hanging out w/ this girl. Lasted about 2 months &amp; she even came to a wedding w/ me. A time she was at our place w/ some friends I noticed that my roommate was giving her lots of attention but brushed it off &amp; was glad my friends liked her.

Things fizzled out between us and agreed that we’d stop seeing one another. A week later my roommate asked what the status was w/ us but it seemed like he already knew, like he’d been talking to her. So I told him and that was that.

A week after he found out we parted ways &amp; 2 weeks after it actually happened I get a text asking if it’s okay that he tries to date this same girl &amp; if it would be weird/uncomfortable for me. But he also insisted that it was premature which made me think if it did happen between them it wouldn’t for a while. I was still mad by him even asking so I dodged it saying he doesn’t need my permission &amp; it didn’t matter how I feel about it, the important thing is they’re both happy &amp; whatever that looks like I’ll learn to deal w/ over time. TIME being the key word. But in all fairness he was trying to do right by me as a friend.

Literally a week later he’s at her place making her dinner. He also invited her to OUR apartment for New Year’s Eve w/o letting me know til a couple hours before, which I wasn’t expecting &amp; made me pretty mad &amp; uncomfortable.

A week later &amp; a month after we parted ways they’re already official &amp; she’s spending the night at our apartment. Things are weird when she’s here, they don’t interact with me much. Even when it’s just my roommate &amp; I things have changed. We barely talk &amp; don’t hang out like we used to. It’s a constantly stressful situation.

An opportunity arose for me live w/ some friends who are pursuing the same business ventures as I &amp; have the same goals/aspirations. Would be a great atmosphere to live in to not only be relieved of this constant stress, but I’d be in a better mindset business wise working towards those goals.

I told him that I’m looking for a sublease &amp; I’m moving out once I do. I explained I feel it’s the best move to preserve our friendship &amp; also for them so they won’t have to tip toe around me anymore. He wasn’t happy &amp; doesn’t want a different roommate, especially one he doesn’t know.

Am I an asshole for doing this? On one end I almost gave him permission to pursue her by not saying it would bother me up front. On the other hand I never expected it to happen so fast.

My girlfriend (17 MtF) and I have kind of a long distance relationship ever since her dad moved up north and her mom followed suit about a year later. We see each other about 1-2 times a month usually for short periods at a time and never across multiple days anymore since she doesn't have a place to stay down here anymore. She also isn't out to my dad, who is 100% against any person with a penis being in the same room as me without direct supervision (even though there are cameras in all the main rooms of the house). He and I have basically never had a great relationship overall because in the past he's had the wonderful combination of being either completely uncaring about me or being extremely controlling and antagonistic towards me because i remind him of my mom. Our relationship has improved a bit within the past year or so, not by much though.

Here's where I'm having my dilemma: I'm hopefully going to get my first car tomorrow and he said he had some extra cash and could help me out a bit, so if this all works out I'll be borrowing $150 from him, which I'll be able to pay back completely within like two weeks.

Most of the time I just zone out and let him go on a 10 minute rant of advice-giving. 

To set the scene, I came home from school after getting groceries and had to leave right away after dropping off my groceries. I talk with my parents a little and they ask me how classes are going. This is where I make my mistake. I nonchalantly just said, ""English is boring and tedious sometimes."". That's it. It was a redundant statement and I wasn't looking for a response.

My dad chimes up, ""Well, it's times like these where you just have do bear down and do the work,"" and then I cut him off.

650,AmItheAsshole,"I’m hoping I’m not too recognizable from this post, but I am probably kidding myself.

James and I started the job at the same time, about a month ago. We have the same job title and duties. However, since James has more work experience (not with this particular type of job, just in general), he gets paid a little more than me. He also got the one office and I got the desk in the waiting room area.

There is no secretary or administrative assistant, so Bossman told us that we would be dividing up all of those duties as they came up. The rest of our job duties are divided between us by number—which can be uneven at times, but levels out to the same amount of work eventually.

At the beginning, several of these type of clerical duties came up. James had been assigned, by number, a more complicated case at the beginning, so he repeatedly asked me to take these duties because he was too busy. So I took on answering phones, ordering office supplies, scheduling travel arrangements, making coffee, greeting and checking in people who come to the office, etc etc. The more complicated case James had is done now, but I’m still doing all of this in addition to my other duties.

I felt like this was an unfair division of labor. Maybe this is a mistake, but I also felt like it was a little sexist to have me doing all of the secretarial things. James is nice but he’s spoken about women before in ways that make me think he might have some biases.

I went to James and I told him I felt like we should divide up the job duties more evenly (not mentioning the sexism thing). He rolled his eyes and look annoyed the whole time, but we did divide them up.

For context: my parents had a very very messy separation and divorce over 4 years. My father had an affair with his current girlfriend, D. My mother has since moved on to her current live in boyfriend, G.

My mum kinda had (im aware this is most likely not the correct term, please forgive me) a psychotic break for 3 years, during one episode, she threatened to abandon us (my sister was 18, I was 14), and another episode we could have charged her with a domestic abuse charge.

My dad gave me an opportunity to come down to Melbourne and stay with him for a few weeks. Ive never been to Melbourne so I agreed. My mum however, didn't like this. At. All.

Eventually, my dad and I expanded the trip to about a month (the 9th to the 30th) and my mum basically denounced the idea.


Originally I was going to babysit my childhood dog, who I love very much on Australia Day weekend. Now, even though I made arrangements for my sister to stay with him instead, mum is complaining that I was irresponsibly and that he's an old dog and I should have thought more about my actions.

My brothers wife passed away in a tragic car accident last September leaving behind their 4 month old son and 5 year old daughter. This was incredibly devastating to my entire family of course. Soon after she passed, my brother (30s) moved him and his kids into my family household with my parents (50s) and me (22F) and my younger brother (18) and sold his house he shared with his wife because living there without her would be too painful. 

Soon after she passed we came to the agreement that I would watch the kids while my brother worked and I would quit both my jobs and start going to online college. The main reason for this is my brother does not make enough money to send both kids to daycare (would be about 550-600$/wk) and we determined I would be paid $200 a week for watching both of them 8am-6pm mon-fri. It felt like it was the right thing to do to be a good aunt and a good sister and it was the least I could do in his current unfortunate situation. I felt okay with rearranging my life to make this transition a little easier on my brother. 
As the months have gone on I am increasingly unhappy and I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I am not making enough to pay my bills so I had to get another job on the weekends to help make ends meet. I have never watched kids before this and when I bring up that I get extremely overwhelmed my worries are made into jokes and not taken seriously. I love my niece and nephew so much but I am just seriously exhausted constantly and unhappy. I am not used to being a full time nanny and it’s not getting any easier, only getting harder. Every single day is a struggle. I asked my brother about the possibility of putting one or both of the kids in daycare but he tells me he can not afford it. I understand it would be expensive but I am seriously concerned for my mental health. I have never struggled with depression until now and every time I bring this up my family tells me I am overreacting and the kids “aren’t that bad”. I want to give up so badly. I don’t know what to do. Do I continue to suffer and watch them or put my foot down? WIBTA if I told my brother who just lost his wife that I can not handle watching his kids anymore? 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions that I can answer, I’m a little overwhelmed at the moment and just want advice so I typed this fast. Thank you all in advance.


EDIT- thank you ALL for the kind words. I appreciate all of you. I will be having a conversation with my brother and family soon.  I already feel so much better having this off my chest.",AITA for not wanting to nanny for my newly widowed brothers kids?

In class today, two of my friends and I (all 16m) were joking around. Friend one showed us a picture of a baby on their phone, who turned out to be his teacher’s. Friend teo and I laugh about it and I say “aw look it’s you and *f one’s girlfriend’s* baby!” Friend one and two laugh along with me, I think no harm is done.

Later though, f one’s gf texts me. She’s lighthearted about it and thought it was funny but claims that f one got upset over it when he laughed about it in class. When I texted him about it, he said he was upset for a bit but knows I didn’t mean anything by it.

654,AmItheAsshole,"Alot more to the story than just the title.

So my husband is a very social person, he tends to interact with people everywhere he goes. A huge extrovert, whereas im a huge introvert.

I dont mind him having female friends, if they are genuine friends who mean something to him. 

The problem arises when he meets women at clubs or parties and then befriends them. Or if he befriends people he just met. I understand living in this day and age there is a certain level of interaction people have to do with each other and thats totally understandable. However I tell him to please just leave the interaction at that, if he meets women, sure go ahead and talk to them socialize with them but end that interaction at whichever social event he is at. There is no need to welcome a person you meet a few hours ago into our lives. And these are also people he will most likely never see again. 

Now im not one to stop him from having female friends, he has more than myself even. And many of them are ones i adore too. And i would completely understand if a he was making a friendship in another type of a environment, for example in a college class u see someone daily and a friendship just naturally develops. I have nothing against that because its natural and it happens. 

I just dont at all see a point in welcoming random people into his life who he has known for not very long. And im not stopping him from socializing with them either. He’s social person and i understand he can socialize with them, all i ask is to leave it at that when it comes to random girls u meet at clubs/parties.

I told him before that as a married man you shouldnt be welcoming new women into your life like that. You keep the conversation at a minimum and move on with your life. He completely agreed with me at first, told me that im right, we’r on a new journey now that we are married and we dont have room for others and it wont happen again.

Now, a month later, he meets a girl at a house party, actually introduces me to her over facetime, (im guessing he thought itd be ok since i “met” her?) and then adds her on social media. Again this is someone he met a couple of hours prior and will most likely never see again.

I bring up the promise he made to me and he then told me that he’s a social person and he cant help it and to just “deal with it” because its not something he can change. 

I’d also like to add that if it was me who was befriending random guys at clubs, he would be absolutely livid.

AITA in all of this? Are my expectations out of line or should i be okay with him befriending new random girls at every party he goes to (weekly/biweekly)?

EDIT: whenever i say people I only mean women since the men he befriends tend to be become genuine friends so that doesnt bother me",AITA for not wanting him to make new friends
655,AmItheAsshole,"Ok. So this is about two of my friends. There's Me (13 F), Delilah (13 F), and Olive (12 F). They both have bad anxiety. Like, bad. Olive constantly scratches her arms from it, so often that they normally bleed. Delilah scratches too, but also starves herself and doesn't drink any water, purposefully. I have to constantly keep them under my watch so that whenever they start scratching I can have them put on a jacket so they don't bleed, and I try to make Delilah eat and drink. They both REFUSE to go to a therapist, or get any help from anyone, and won't tell anyone anything. No matter how hard I try, it doesn't get them to stop scratching themselves at all, and if it does, they start again in like 15 minutes. I can't really do anything else at all because I'm always focused on them. I can't hang out with any other friends without me worrying if they're ok or not. Don't get me wrong, I still care about them both a lot, it's just that I'm tired of having to constantly babysit them. Almost every time, it doesn't work anyway  so what's the point? I kind of wish I could stop caring so I won't have to baby them anymore. It feels so selfish, so I keep watching them, but I don't want to. I have other things I need to focus on, most importantly, school.

One night I was working on my laptop trying to finish an very important essay. I had procrastinated on it a little so I’m kinda in a rush. To help myself be the most productive possible, I took off my jeans, got into my most comfortable position on my bed and put on some random pop music just to help me focus, but then the door suddenly just opens and in comes my dad followed by like 4 guests. They start touring my room, while I quickly reached to turn the music off after a bit of initial shock. They looked around everywhere, and I didn’t really know what to do so I just stared at them. My dad wanted me to say hi and introduce myself, but I just couldn’t let out anything under that situation. They then left after looking through all the mess, and needless to say I was super embarrassed and angry. I quickly got dressed and went out. I met one of them in the living room and he said sorry about that so in courtesy I replied it’s fine, but I was still furious underneath, so when I returned to my room I slammed the door pretty loudly.

Later when I went down again I found my mom in the kitchen who was really mad at me. She told me that I was being very rude to the guests. I didn’t say anything and went back to my room to finish up the essay. AITA?

Here are a few more details that could be useful:
-I was completely unaware of the guests before they came in. No one told me, nor did they knock before coming into the room.
-The man was the only one who said sorry after. They other 3 said nothing.
-What made me the most upset is that after seeing me with a laptop, my dad started talking about how gaming is such a problem for children nowadays with one of the women, right in front of me. Later when I wasn’t able to reply to their greetings, the woman was like “just let him be he’s too busy gaming”.
-To be fair, it was my dad who led them in and didn’t knock, and he was also the one who initiated that gaming convo. Maybe I shouldn’t have been rude to the guests if it wasn’t really them.
-my room had this huge train model which the previous owner left for us, so they most likely just came in to look at the model. They did glance everywhere, though.
-my mother was sick and they were there to help with her illness so they were obviously nice people. Maybe I should have been more mature?",AITA for slamming the door on my family’s guests?

658,AmItheAsshole,"Last year I (23f) was an exchange student studying in USA. While there I became friend with F (25m) and H (19m), another exchange student. I soon introduced them to one another because of our shared hobby, D&amp;D. For months we met multiple times a week with some other people. One day F decided to introduce his brother, B (17m) to the group. B was a really shy guy, F mentioned he wanted him to join the group to push him to have a more active social life, and also because he really loved D&amp;D. Despite initially being reluctant B kept showing up to all the sessions and eventually befriended the other players and got comfortable.

We had the habit of going to grab something to eat after every session, but one evening it was only me, H and B. To cut a long story short, that’s when he came out as gay, saying that H and I were the first openly LGBT people he met (I’m lesbian, H is bi). He explained to us that he spent the last years of his life feeling really miserable due to his embarrassment about being gay and after seeing how open and happy we were about our sexual orientation he decided to ask for advice. We explained to him that he had nothing to be embarrassed about, that he was perfectly fine, and that there’s nothing wrong with loving someone of the same gender.

Then at the end of the semester, H and I went back to our respective countries.

One day I get a call from F who’s completely losing his shit. He said that he “accidentally” logged in B’s fb account and that realized it wasn’t his own only after starting to read his messages (nobody believed that), and tells me that B and H are getting “sexual” and that he will have to have a talk with B (he showed me the conversations, they were flirty and sometimes somewhat sexual, but no photos). Knowing how bad B’s anxiety can be, I decided to warn him about what happened before F.

The next day B disappears from all the socials, and for weeks I can’t get a hold of him. I ask F who tells me that B is fine, just busy. A few weeks after I get a call from an unknown number, I answer and it’s B, crying and absolutely desperate. He basically explains how F outed him to the rest of the family and how they then proceeded to delete all his socials, taking his phone away and means to contact friends away and forcing him to go to some kind of therapy to “fix him” and calling the police on H. I was shocked, because I come from a country where it’s legal and acceptable to date a minor as long as they are at least 16 and the age gap isn’t more than 4 years.

This makes me furious, but I managed to calm him, and I suggested him to move in with his mom, who lives on the other side of the country (she is also religious but much more comprehensive), and eventually that’s what he did. F and some others accused me of sticking my nose in another family’s business and that I had no rights to push him away from them, but I think I did the right as B is happy now.

660,AmItheAsshole,"George, Matt, and I all split a monthly subscription for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Recently, George asked if his cousin could use the account, to which I agreed if he was going to cover for her. When the time came for me, the account holder, to collect the monthly $4 fee, I asked if his cousin was using the account, and if so, if he was covering for her. I was under the impression that that meant he was going to pay extra per month to cover her portion. When I asked George about the extra fee, he told me that she was covered under HIS original agreed fee of $4. I then told him that it was unfair of him to cover her portion with his fee because that meant, in theory, two users were paying less than the other two users (Matt and I). This led to an argument that ultimately ""ended"" our friendship. Am I the Asshole for expecting the cousin to have to pay for the shared subscription?

***Side Note: When originally discussed i was 99.99% sure that George agreed that he would cover her portion. I feel that I'm right because if someone is going to use the account, then they should have to pay, therefore making everyone else pay less. I felt it was unfair that someone was using the account for free. He thought he was correct because, since he pays for the account, he can give it to whomever he chooses and also choose whether or not they pay.

Matt has not weighed in. Keep in mind Matt and George live together.

Here's the math. The fee is $15/mo. I was originally charging George and Matt $4/mo and I would pick up the extra $3/mo. 4x2=8 + my contribution of $4=$12 with a leftover $3 covered by me. If the cousin contributed, or was paid for by George, the fee per person would be $3/mo per person and George, covering his cousin, would pay $6.

664,AmItheAsshole,"This is a throwaway, and I need to be honest- this situation is from a few years back but it started bothering me recently because I'll see the people involved (besides the man in question) soon at an event.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never sure whether I did something wrong here, so I really need honest opinions. I'll try to keep it short:

&amp;#x200B;

I worked for a huge company and I was only 19 years old, the man in question was 32 years old. We worked in the same team and had regular casual contact in the start- only work related, and I was only friendly as I'd be with anyone. One day I noticed him increasingly staring at me from time to time, and staying in late when I'd stay in late at night alone in the office despite him not doing it before. This went on for a week or two, and then came my birthday- he came into the office and when he realized it's my birthday he just abrubtly ran out and showed up with flowers an hour later. I thought it was kind but it kind of made me feel uncomfortable, I don't know why. A few days later he jokingly insinuated in front of the whole team that I'm an 'easy' chick and it came out of nowhere, I was insulted. He proceeded to glance at me and stay in late, even going as far as walking me to my car at night even though it wasn't on his way home. He never really touched me, made a sexual comment or did anything aggressive but I felt very uneasy; because of his age, because he was a functional junky, because he had a creepy jail looking tattoo that he made for one girl- only to find out that it was some kind of crush of his and he never dated her. I admit, I was always bad at creating boundaries and I acted nice to him despite it trying to avoid conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

After this went on for a few weeks I broke down . i couldn't pinpoint what he's done so bad but I felt so uneasy. I went and told my parents about it- my dad found his adress and went to talk to him. My dad is in no way agressive or scary, he just told him that he's making me uncomfortable and that he should stop it. The next day, I was called in to a meeting with him and HR, he told about it at work, and claimed that he didn't know why I hated him because he loved me. I broke down crying in front of them and just begged to be left alone- not my proudest moment... I was overwhelmed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the board of the company called me in- they told me that it's not right and sounds like sexual harassment. The thing is- I don't remember everything anymore, and I live in fear of feeling like I might have accidentally exaggarated something because non of this seemed like sexual harassment to me...it happened only a few times, I just wanted to move to another team... Even after all this went down he followed me down the hallways on day to question me why I hate him, it really disturbed me I just felt so unsafe that I told him off and left work...

Just a sanity check, not validation.  Lay it on me if you think I'm wrong.  Overall I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

I'll keep it a bit short.

I  have a mother in law, whom up to this point I've been relatively ok  with, mutual respect, no amiss feelings, some level of friendship  overall.  She lives with myself and my wife, there's even a respect of  mutual space.

Wife and myself  recently had a newborn, my wife performed a procedure on him that I  wanted nothing to do with.  I was upset, hurt, angry - all sorts of  emotions wrapped up into one.

We  get back home from the hospital, I'm in a world of pain and hurt, it's  my first born (Never have I experienced such a love before as far as  having a kid - you literally want NO harm for them).  I'm in the chair  with my head hanging down, just confused and upset.  She comes up to me,  I can only see her feet and says hey, I've got this for you daddy - I  politely say I'm ok thank you, as I initially thought it was food or a  drink.  I couldn't have been more polite.   I look up and I saw a gift  cert. for a haircut so I said, ok , thank you.  Accepted it and put it  on the couch beside me as I put my head back down.   I was in a very  dark place, just hurt overall, wanted to sit down and understand what  had happened.

Turns out my mother  in law was gravely offended by this and saw it as rude and disrespectful  - I couldn't believe it, I still can't.   My wife thinks the same.  At  this point I'm trying to lay out every aspect of the incident bit by bit  but I still get a ""yeah you were hurt but it was still disrespectful  and rude"".  She felt as if i should apologize.

666,AmItheAsshole,"First post here, sorry if I get something wrong. I'm in my mid 20's and finally got a decent scholarship that pays for almost everything for university. I'm beyond excited to finally go and was planning on living on campus because my parent's house is 40 minutes away, I want to focus 100% on school, and I don't have a car(current house is nearby enough to everything that I just walk). I work full-time atm and make an okay amount of money, but I hate hate hate my job and desperately want an education to get a better one lol.

My dad works a full time job and makes 1.5 times more than what I do.

The only issue is that my parents have been relying more and more on my income to the point that I pay the rent and they pay everything else (electric, water, their groceries, etc) now. Despite the fact that I'm giving them a heck ton of money, the house is in total disrepair and honestly just a pain to live in. The landlord never fixes anything, there is one bathroom for my entire family, the roof in one room has completely collapsed due to a storm and we just blocked it off and don't go in there. My parents are afraid that if they complain too much about anything, the landlord will just kick us out, and the rent here is cheap for our area. So I'm just paying the rent on a place that should be condemned at this point.

When I told my parents, 10 months before I planned on leaving for school, that I was going to do so, my dad looked me straight in the eye and said ""if you leave, there's no way we can live here or anywhere else.""

Idk what to do now because if it was just my parents I'd probably leave anyway, but it's also my teenage sister and she deserves a solid roof over her head (or as close as we currently have lmao). I also can't just stay here and go to school because I'd have to still work full-time and I know myself and I know I wouldn't be able to do that and succeed at school. 

What makes me the most mad is that a few months ago my parents borrowed over ten thousand dollars from a retirement thing and instead of using it to move, they paid some old bills and wasted most of the rest of it. They specifically said that they'd rather live in this crappy house then move because 'moving isn't long-term sustainable'.

(Also, I'm under no illusions that I'm not benefiting from this arrangement. Moving out on my own would be wayyy more expensive, this house is perfectly located for my current workplace, AND my dad occasionally cooks homemade meals that are divine, but also I can't live like this forever. I need, and want, an education lol.)

TL:DR: Parents rely on my full-time income to pay rent, despite my dad making more than me. WIBTA for telling my parents that they've got about 8 months to figure out what to do because I'm going to school anyway?



Edit: Wow ok I didn't expect I would get nearly as much advice and input as I've been getting, thank you all omg. I've been reading all the comments but I've been working and can't really reply to them all, but to clarify a few things that people have asked:

-I think I said it somewhere below in a confusing way, but I believe a big part of why my parents dont want to move is because we are just barely in the best school zone in the area.

-The cost of living here is insane, I make a few thousand under half the median income, my dad makes a few thousand over half. Also I live in the USA.

-My mom worked a few days a week for minimum wage to supplement my dad's income, until quitting last year due to chronic illness. She cannot work now at all and is filing for disability, but it's taking a while.

-Sister is too young to get a part-time job, and I desperately don't want her to if at all possible. She needs to focus on school.

-The landlord has known about the roof issues since 2018, before it collapsed last year. He HAS had insurance people come to look at it once, but nothing has been done in two years. He has also flat out told us that if we complain too much, he's raising the rent. But of course we don't have that in writing =/.  

-The university is a very reputable, accredited state uni. The fact that people asked about this is so sweet omg thank you for making sure.

-I feel like I made my dad seem worse than he is. He's always always said that he doesn't want me to feel like I owe him just because I make money, or that I need to give him all of my money, because he was raised that way and hated it. But then he asks for more and more so idk.

-Parents have no addiction problems or anything. They just kinda... suck with money? On top of that, we live in an area that is wayyyy above our budget.

-I had no idea that we may have a legal case against my crappy landlord. I am 100% looking into that the moment I get home. As well as some other places to live for my parents. To be honest, just half an hour or so away there are places that I could afford even on my own, so we might just need to have an honest discussion about living within our means at this point. 

Anyway all of your responses have helped me SO much you have no idea. I legit thought I was being the a**hole for even thinking of leaving, but this has given me a ton to think about. Thank you so much! (Also sorry if the edit is against the rules, again I'm new to this!!)

667,AmItheAsshole,"Now first for some background: I (23F) live with my fiancé (24M) and a friend of ours (22M). Fiancé and I are quite clean people and we take care of dishes right away when we cook/bake and don’t leave things laying around. However, our roommate does not have that same initiative, he leaves coats/shirts/blankets laying around the living room, does not clean or take care of his dishes when he uses them. He then will use our utensils and cooking stuff without asking and doesn’t clean them. 
Also, he almost always has his girlfriend over, which doesn’t bother me usually, but they both use our stuff and sometimes eat and drink things that WE bought with OUR money. His bathroom is a mess and dirty (we have the master bedroom w/ a private bathroom), even his girlfriend refuses to use his bathroom and will walk all the way downstairs to use the guest bathroom on the first floor of our two story townhome.

So our roommate does not pick up on the social cues that he should take care of this and will do it if asked, but we shouldn’t have to ask him. Will I be the jerk if I confront him about everything and about the fact even his own girlfriend doesn’t like it? I don’t want him to be mad, but this is getting ridiculous, this is the home of all three of us and I feel he’s disrespecting it!",WIBTA if I confronted my roommate about his unclean habits?

669,AmItheAsshole,"My grandma and grandpa are in their 80s. My grandma is spending the night in hospital because of a procedure she got done.

My mum approached me before I left for work this morning. I work 40 minutes from home and on a Friday I spend the night with a friend who only lives 5 minutes from my workplace. I finish work 6pm on Friday and start at 8am on Saturday. It's a very convenient routine to spend the night 5 min from work.

Mum approached me in regards to my grandma and grandpa. she expressed that because Grandma will be spending the night in hospital she is worried that there might be some complications leaving my grandpa at home. 

it is also important to mention that my parents are going 6 hours out of town for their wedding anniversary for the weekend. traditionally my mum would opposed the responsibility of checking on my grandpa, however, that's not possible in this case.

When mum asked me if I could check on grandpa tonight I have refused. I said it was going to be too far out of my way and I start work at 8 a.m. on Saturday.

Okay well no one asked you, x can do what she wants. I had an eating disorder in the past and when I would binge she would always be like ""well tell me what you ate"" like why do you need to know what I ate, I feel like shit so why would you even think to ask me what I ate.

This would happen all the time. I told her once I was sick and felt like shit and I puked from a binge, I answer what happened because she kept asking and I was like ""I binged"" and she goes ""what did you eat?"" Like this is not her business.

671,AmItheAsshole," Some time ago, I went to the surprise party of a friend of mines (let's call him A), at the house of a common friend of ours (let's call him B). Up to that point, I had absolutely no problems or conflicts with B's parents -- they're really and chill people, the kind which is responsible without being over restrictive. They never did anything for me in particular, but a good amount of friends of within our circle have been saved by how helpful they can be (with rides, giving their home to events, etc). And, even though I haven't found myself in this situation, I already had plenty of afternoons at their house with my friends which they were really friendly and talkative.

So, in this day in particular -- since it as his birthday and all --, the parents of friend A were invited to our hang-out as well, as long with as much people we could fit in there. Never talked with him before (aside from one or two words, maybe), but never had any problems with him either. Closer to the end of the party, we were playing cards in the same table -- a game of four players, in two pairs, where each pair has to set opposite to itself. Since he was the ""enemy team"", I had to sit right next to him. At the middle of the game, he started smoking -- and, as someone who isn't really fondle neither of the smell or the toxic properties of cigarettes --, I asked if he could stop. To be honest, I don't remember how I worded it, but I can't imagine I were rude -- probably was something like ""hey, do you mind if I ask you to not smoke near me?"".

I didn't even thought it would be a big deal, it seems reasonable to me to ask someone that is close to you to stop smoking. After all, different from bear or anything else, it's impossible to avoid -- at least, in this case, not without suddenly leaving the game --, and is something which could have consequences in the future even if you are not a smoker yourself -- especially in my case, since I lived in a house with two smoking parents for more than a decade until I finally conviced them to quit. And from this day foward, it's been really hard to invite my friend B to hang-out. I just imagined it was the pressure of the last year of High School, the money he was spending to afford his techincal course, and so on. But recently I discovered that actually, both his parents thought it was outrageous for me to ask A's father to stop smoking. Seems like A's father got really offended, left the party right there (I didn't even notice this in the day), and B's parents just don't let him accept my invites for hang outs ever since.

Is it really overreaction on their part, considering I am almost harmless as a human being -- like, I barely leave my house most of the time. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't look any suspicious, and have been as nice as possible with them since the first time we met --, or was I really the asshole?",AITA for asking my friend's father to stop smoking when he was at the same table as me?
672,AmItheAsshole,"*sorry for format, on mobile* 

So let me start off by saying that I’m
in a very happy and committed relationship with my boyfriend of 3 years. He’s a great man and i love him dearly! 
Now, a few months ago i started at a new job working in a warehouse. I like the job, very laid back and I get to work by myself everyday. The only thing i don’t like about this job is that i get hit on multiple times a day. And i’m not trying to sound a certain way. it’a honestly gotten annoying since i tell them all i have a boyfriend and am not interested. I keep to myself at work and rarely talk to anyone.
well some of these men are very persistent to the point i’m about to go to HR to have some peace of mind. 
 Anyways back to the story. So this one guy in particular has been flirting with me since i first started and i’ve told him i have bf and whatnot. he doesn’t care. 
 After a few weeks i realized he had a girlfriend. Now this girl does not like me. She goes out of her way to be rude and honestly i’ve never said a word to her but if looks could kill..
she’s just bitter and will do little things to piss me off like cut me off with her fork lift, hold up the aisle i’m working in. stupid stuff like that. 

Today i realized her boyfriend only flirts with me when she’s not there. I’m debating on saying something to her but the way she treats me a stranger is just flat out rude and immature. I honestly don’t feel like i owe it to her in the slightest and don’t wanna cause any drama with her and what not.

673,AmItheAsshole,"I (18M) live in the unfortunate reality whereby most girls I know have a crush on my dad (45M). 

My dad used to be a model and still keeps in great shape. Tbh he doesn't look his age and is quite big with muscles so I understand, but it pisses me the fuck off. It just makes me cringe and feel resentment. 

Even my sister (22F)'s friends thirst over him. It annoys me to no end. 

I'm still in high school but this one girl (18F) in my class got talking to me and I thought we were getting close as friends. Well she asked me whether she could come to mine and I said yeah, I was excited cos I thought maybe she likes me. 

Well then she asked me whether my dad will be there. Honestly my heart just sank. I explained to her that no, he won't, and that he has a girlfriend (30F) anyway. She then asked whether there will be a day that he will be there. 

I told her to fuck off and that she's fucking weird. She then got pissed at me and called me asshole and said ""Why can't you look more like your dad"". That hurt.

674,AmItheAsshole,"Well my title sums it up but I’ll add some info. I started working in the accounting office at a car dealership about a month and a half ago. It was the most entry level that entry level jobs could get; I was basically doing all the crappy paperwork that everyone else needed for their jobs but were too busy to do themselves. We all know those jobs. I didn’t mind it because it was menial and I listened to audiobooks all day. 

So last Monday the office manager asked how I’d feel about taking over another girl’s job because she put in her two weeks. I was pretty excited about moving up so I agreed. I’ve been getting trained on it over the last week and a half and I’m not comfortable to take over starting this coming Monday but I’ve been busting my butt and trying to understand. Her job is very specific, there’s lots of parts to it, there’s so many different things to do, and she’s the only person in the office that knows how to do it. They haven’t let me forget that detail. 

She has arguably one of the most important jobs in the office. Basically I went from moderate workload and minimal responsibility to huge workload and huge responsibility. With no raise I might add. Not to mention I’m driving over an hour both ways and not getting home until it’s almost time for my kids to go to bed. 

But I’ve been trudging along being a trooper because everyone else has their job and no one wants to do this job so sure, let’s stick the newest person with the least experience with it. The girl who’s training me is constantly on her phone and not paying attention to what I’m doing and I’ve made a lot of mistakes. Every time I make a mistake she starts berating me and acting all condescending. She says stuff like “It’s actually really easy if you use your common sense.” 

The last couple days I’ve felt like I’ve been nearing a breakdown. The more mistakes I make the more tension I feel in the office. I’m not a confrontational person by any means so I’ve sat there with tears in my eyes while she’s texting in the office group chat, which I’m not in. I’ll make a mistake, she picks up her phone and starts texting, phones buzz, the other girls laugh. All day today. And she’s just standing behind me whispering to another girl and they’re just giggling. I went to the bathroom and called my husband crying then when I went back to the office I heard her tell the office manager that I was crying and she, the manager, goes “Oh that’s funny.”

I’m just not going back tomorrow. I’ve made up my mind. My husband thinks I’m running away from my problems and wants me to at least go talk it through with them but my mom, sister, and cousin basically say fuck em. My reasoning is that they’ll have two days to train someone with years more experience than I had and it’s really not my problem how they solve it after that because they should’ve thought about how they treated their only option for a job that’s an asset to the entire dealership. 

So AITA? I’m still not going but I’ll accept my judgement.",AITA for no showing my job even though I’m the only option for a position that’s being vacated at the end of the week?
675,AmItheAsshole,"Just to get this out of the way I don't like this girl, I never did, and I never wanted to her to be my girlfriend, I just wanted to help her as a friend.  


So Story time first: I meet this girl in the beginning of 2018, and she was madly in love with a friend of mine (lets just call him Alex). What then happen was that Alex didn't like her back, I tried to help her get over him(Something that SHE asked me to help her with), but since 2018 she keeps saying that she is the right girl for him and that he is the right boy for her. In the mean time (2019) I had interest in her friend as well (Lets call her Maria), Maria didn't like me back and I was kinda devastated about it, since Maria kissed someone in front of me, and she helped me get over it (will touch on this later in the story),something that I'am great full to this day. Thing is she kept using me to see Alex constantly, asking me to call our group to hangout just so she could see him, and the hangouts where always about the both of them, this was stressing not only me but the whole group.

This went on from 2018 till now 2020. I was trying to help this girl. I talked to her about not seeing Alex because this was something that would be bad for her, but she just wouldn't listen to me, it felt like talking to a wall, it felt like she didn't give a shit, one time I caught her looking at my phone and sending Alex messages like it was me. After this it was always the same thing, she would see him she would feel madly in love again and be rejected. So there I was late at night consoling her again.

Today was the breaking point, I stood my ground and when she asked me to call the group to hang out and I flat out refused, said it wasn't good for her and with frustration boiling I said that I didn't want to talk about this again. She seemed fine at first, but then she said ""I just thought you would be more considerable since I helped you with Maria"", and that was it, I didn't explode but I wish I had, the Maria situation took 3 months tops, and she was in this state of madness over my friend for over 2 years. She also puled the Anxiety card, saying that since me and her both suffer with Anxiety problems that I would understand her and all. I was fucking furious, but didn't respond her not to say anything that I would regret.

And that was it, I just couldn't anymore, I gave her every piece of advice that I had, and she never listed to it, it was like talking to a wall for 2 full years, I even tried to be polite about it, saying that she was a very close and considered friend but also saying that I just couldn't deal with this Alex Situation anymore, she is now kinda pissed at me and I can see why, but after 2 years I was beyond burned out, I'am not a psychiatrist and I didn't know what to do, also the fact that she kept ignoring my advises didn't help. So what do you guys think AITA for refusing to help her any longer?",AITA for refusing to help this girl any longer?
676,AmItheAsshole,"As it reads. 

I left my house with my wallet in my left pants pocket, taking it out to pay the bus fare, then putting it back in either my pants pocket or jacket pocket, unzipped. On the bus ride, I ran into a girl I knew who ended up sitting very close to me. Her character is somewhat questionable to me, and she would have had easy access to the jacket pocket without me noticing. I left the bus at the same stop as her and walked up the street with her before we parted ways. 

For the next half hour or so I walk around a semi-busy metropolitan city area listening to music and generally not being aware of my surroundings, while not physically bumping into anyone or anything, nor getting close enough where someone might have the opportunity to pickpocket me. I spot my roommate further up the street and meet up with him, and agree to walk to a mutual location. He’s typically standoffish, but I’ve nothing to attest to his character. 

(Now it’s important to mention that both people I considered have a criminal history. Surrounding myself with different people right now unfortunately isn’t an option)

I mention to him, when we get where we were going, that my wallet’s gone, and that it’s probably on the bus. I call the bus, give them the specifics - no luck. I ask my roommate to retrace our steps with me. He seems a little energetic and eager to be more friendly with me than usual. I make a mental note as we walk back into town. As we near where we started walking, I explain to him that it would make me feel comfortable if he showed me he didn’t have it. I explain to him that I’m sorry for not having complete trust and that I only ask to check because of my own failings in the past regarding judgement. He says something along the lines of “every action has a reaction.” Which I figured means he’s upset that I asked. A few minutes later, he let me look. Nothing in his bag, all his pocketed items were on the sidewalk. Nothing. I apologized for the trouble.

I later saw the girl from the bus again hanging out with a mutual friend. I asked her if I could check her bag. I explained I had no proof, nor premeditated idea of her taking my wallet, just the unfortunate circumstances of the various situations that would have likely led to my wallet disappearing. She got upset, making comments like

 “I’m gonna punch you in the face.” 

Or 

“No you can’t look in my bag, I have a bunch of tampons in there.” 

She told the group a few stories about how she actually had returned a wallet to some man who had lost it when she worked as a taxi driver. It felt defensive, but I was over vigilant. I understand false implications make you defensive (especially in a group setting) and female hygiene products could be embarrassing to go through.

I conceded, but to my surprise she offered me the bag a few minutes later. I didn’t check. I apologized and told her I appreciated her allowing me to check. I apologized for being frustrated.

AITA for asking these people to see the contents of their bags, given the circumstances?

Edit: Important to note, me and my roommate along the way found a bag on a guardrail. He said “free bag” and looked through it’s contents then asked if I needed a bag. Not the same situation, but a slight indicator of behavior in a relevant way. 

Also: No slight on those with criminal records. A lot of the time we’ve been put into situations which cause us to make bad decisions. Some of the tendencies stick.

F - ""dude why the fuck are you playing sleeping dogs just play gta v, sleeping dogs is literally a crappier version of gta""

M - ""DUDE, shut the fuck up you haven't even played sleeping dogs yet, not every open world game has to be exactly like gta""

F - ""i don't need to play it to see that it's shit, it's 
literally going on sale for less than 5 dollars while gta v is on sale for 20 dollars, i doubt i would even play it even if you gifted it to me""

M - ""DUDE, you literally cant argue on which 
game is better if you haven't even fucking played one of the games, this game is fantastic and i can't believe i've wasted some minutes of my life arguing to a guy that barely qualifies as a gamer so if you don't mind me i'm going to keep playing""

Little hammer wasn't abused persay but the little dude wasn't being properly cleaned out, wasn't being fed properly and my 'friend' teased him by dropping food pellets on him, bedding and just generally agitating him. I agonised over it for a bit before deciding to rescue the lad and walked out of my friend's place with the cage and took it home with me.

Technically it isn't even his hamster, it was his ex's he was supposed to be looking after but they had a falling out where he thought she was cheating and he lied to her that it died - that was probably around late November. I've been trying to find out his ex's name/details but I'm not even sure if she lives in the area anymore. If she does I'll return the little dude but he's growing on me especially since he lets me handle him. If I eat chicken he gets chicken, if I eat sunday dinner he gets a little bit. And some muesli type mix and kaytee bedding. He nibbles on my fingers but it's not nasty, it's really endearing. If I don't get him out at least once each night he'll stand on top of a 'bridge' in his cage looking for me.

But now all my friends got pissed at me cause I wanted more people to play with in the future and have some fun with me. Eventually everyone just blames the whole situation on me which I can understand. But the problem was that my other friends who I had ask to buy said they didn’t not want to play with others because they were bad and wouldn’t play well.

Three months ago I was approached by my friend/coworker about possibly going fulltime with them, doing stuff relevant to my degree. I of course said that I was very interested. He said it would probably take a few months to a year for anything to come to fruition becuase the company is slow at hiring new full timers.

Theres always been an understanding between my dad and I that I wouldnt be there forever, and that I don't like the work or the people I work with there. I told him I was approached and he seemed annoyed. Told him it probably wouldnt happen for 6 months or more. 

He recently had surgery on his arm and is down for a few weeks (another 3-5 weeks in his cast). He refuses to not work and chooses to get hurt trying to do two-handed tasks with one hand and a cast. 

Yesterday I was approached again about going fulltime immediately with the other company and I accepted. It's a decent pay increase, and I love that company, coworkers and the work. But I'll be traveling 2-3 weeks a month which isnt exactly ideal for a 8-5 construction job. 

Hes upset and keeps saying that he was planning on giving me his company soon. I've made it clear I had no intentions of staying where I was and that he needed to hire more skilled help before I was gone.

I refused to sign, effectively resigning. 

After the resignation meeting, I sent a heartfelt goodbye letter to the parents of my kids (saying nothing derogatory about the school, just simply stating we felt it best to part ways) and saying I looked forward to the last lesson the school elected to let me teach since I'd been paid for it.

The admin responded that this was inappropriate and that they are now going to slander me because I sent that without express permission and that I'm not to return to even say goodbye or teach.

However Hannah never reached out to me during the last couple of months to ask how my dad /I were. Despite knowing he had declined from text messages I sent her and photos I shared of my dad on social media she did not reply/reach out. However she continued to blow up our friendship circle’s group chat about trivial matters like costumes for parties, in-jokes etc. I found this to be really insensitive, but she’s never been great with texting and so I put this down to her being busy and stressed at the time.

During this time I still managed to make it to her house auction to support her. I had to leave before I was able to see her following the auction as my mum had become ill and there was no one to care for my dad. I sent her a congratulatory message and let her know why I had to leave, but again I received no reply. 

1 day after he died she sent a picture in the group chat of her overseas saying she was having “a shit time” as a joke. Despite her not knowing he had passed yet she knew he was gravely ill and so I found this to be quite offensive. She found out via social media and sent me her condolences, but did not send flowers/card. My friends were at the funeral but she was still away at the time (only away 1wk). Soon after in a group chat she replied to a comment from me and I ended up saying “nice to hear from you Hannah.” As I had virtually not heard from her otherwise. This was passive aggressive on my behalf and I apologised for this right away privately. 

I then expressed how hurt I had been about how unsupportive she was. She was very defensive and didn’t acknowledge my points about her lack of contact/replies. She just said that it was too hard for her to talk to me about it because of her own dad. He died 15 years ago from a stroke, although she was quite estranged from him. I found this to be a massive cop out. It sounded as though she realised how bad a friend she had been but was clinging to this as a reason for being completely self-absorbed. Since, she has been overbearing in group chats with compliments and organising events with the wider group, it seems in an attempt to not lose face as a “good friend”. I have been polite with her in group settings but distant otherwise. She has been passive aggressive with me at times in group threads.

I don’t expect the world to revolve around me but I expected more. Am I not being empathetic enough of her circumstances or is she just a bad/selfish friend?",AITA for cutting off a best friend after my Dad died?

She keeps bringing it back up that I left her after our baby was born. She keeps fighting me and telling me that I'm wrong that I went back to work.

It's on a Tuesday I'm on the middle of of million-dollar job that I am in charge of I told her I will probably have to go back to work whenever we get home she now is hysterically crying and bring up how I left her three years ago and that I am basically a piece of s*** because I'm going back to work and not staying home with her for a whole week.

689,AmItheAsshole,"  I started at this Chinese boutique about 6 months ago and was hired as the assistant manager. From the get-go, this company has shown to be increasingly problematic. The manager of the store that hired me was incredibly lazy and would often chastise me for my selling tactics for being too “aggressive”. The manager went on a two week vacation during my first month there, I was still training and was expected to run the store in her absence. Upper management was very unhelpful while my manager was away. The US director, Meredith, who holds the top position in the US division of the company called me one day to complain about our poor sales dating back before I was hired and took her anger out on me. 
  After my manager returned from vacation, she took a job somewhere else and left the company. I have prior management experience so it would be a natural fit for me to step into the store manager role. I proposed this to the district manager, Cynthia. She was understandably unsure as I was still so new with the company. She decided to give me a trial as acting store manager. In the meantime, Cynthia rehired a past employee named Donna. Donna is almost 10 years older than me and had worked for the company for year.
  It’s been three months and Cynthia has yet to give me the title, find a new store manager, or compensate me for the work I’ve done as the acting manager. During this time, it’s become blatantly apparent that Donna doesn’t like me as a manager. Donna is passive aggressive, constantly undermines me, and generally makes me feel inadequate. She talks about me behind my back to the part-time employees on my days off. I’m sure she feels frustrated that someone who is 10 years younger than her and doesn’t have as much experience in the company is running the store. I’ve addressed these issues both with Donna and Cynthia to little or no avail of resolution. I’ve spoken with Cynthia multiple times about Donna’s behavior, but there’s not much that can be done. Between the lack of sufficient pay and Donna making me feel uncomfortable, I’m at my end with this company.
  As for the understaffed part, Cynthia, has been struggling finding a store manager for her store. She often has to use Donna or myself to cover her so she can have a day off. If I left, finding coverage would be nearly impossible.",WIBTA if I quit a job that is already severely understaffed?

691,AmItheAsshole,"(I’m on mobile, so I’m sorry for any formatting issues)

Some background: I’m 20 years old and I’ve been going to a community college near home for 2 years. I originally wanted to go straight to a 4 year, but community college was the most financially responsible decision, as my parents are paying for my school (I am very lucky to have them do this for me). I received an associates degree this past semester and I am now ready to transfer. I applied to a few schools, got accepted, decided which one I wanted to go to, and told my parents. Here’s the issue: the school is 7 hours away from where we live, and dorming is the best option for living there. My parents were shocked by my decision, to say the least. It took a lot of long talks and explanations, but they agreed that this would work, so I accepted the admission. 

I am supposed to move in to the dorms on the 25th, so I really only have a day left at home. I was talking to my mom about a payment that is due soon, and she started getting upset. She told me that this is a huge burden on the family and that she still doesn’t understand why I’m doing this. I have felt incredibly guilty about my decision from the very beginning, so her saying this has me seriously doubting even going. Not to mention that the rest of my family hasn’t been incredibly supportive (my older sister has told me many times that I’m being selfish by going to a school that will cost so much). I really don’t know if I’m doing the right thing anymore, but if I decide not to go I’ll have to wait another year before I can go to a different school, as I’d have to wait for applications to open up. 

I’m especially confused because for years, my parents have told me that they will be there for me so long as I go to college. My dad has told me many times that he has money saved up and no matter what, he can cover the cost. When I brought this up to my mom, she said that they didn’t expect me to dorm, so that seems to be the real issue here. 

We’re not really wealthy, both my parents work warehouse jobs and I appreciate them so much for what they’ve done for me. I have tried to alleviate the financial burden as much as possible by going to a community college first, and I would only be at my transfer university for 3-4 semesters. (I don’t qualify for financial aid, aside from some loans, unfortunately.) I thought we had worked everything out, but as the move-in day gets closer it feels like my family has just been holding in their issues with my decision. 

So, am I the asshole for choosing this college? I wanted to prioritize myself for the rest of my college experience, but now I feel like I’ve been selfish. 

tl;dr: I’m transferring to a university that is too far for me to live at home, so I have to dorm. My family is now saying that this is too much of a financial burden, and I fear I might have been selfish in my decision. AITA?

It's $120.00 rounded up for our two phones.

693,AmItheAsshole,"I’ll try keep it short. For starters, I paid for it and the game is mine also paid by me. My husband has an addiction to the point where he neglects his responsibilities including our animals. Today was not an isolated event, it happens every single day. 

Today I was in hospital and had to drive myself there and back, I received no support other than a few questions about what’s going on when I get home. We have been arguing about the xbox literally every day. It started off with him getting an attitude about cleaning up after himself, coming on walks (we have a dog) and simple things like that. It got worse and the arguments have turned nasty since then. Today obviously I’m feeling horrendous and had a lot of invasive tests done so I just wanted to chill. He has a presentation due at work tomorrow (he has known about this for 3 weeks and only started it tonight) and due to the fact I’m a full time student I don’t really have sympathy for assignments due. My workload is considerably higher than his and constant, I have to balance it with all the typical things you’d expect a wife to do. I had an exam, then drove 10 hours and still russled up a home cooked meal for him. I balance my time and I understand the stress, but i don’t think it’s a good enough excuse.

The name calling and silly remarks got the best of me today. It’s the one day I’ve asked him to step up to the plate and even then I still helped him with his presentation. I simply asked him to feed our animals, a 10 minute job in total. He went nuts asking for time to himself and in return I said if he touched that xbox again within the next 24 hours id smash it up. He retaliated with saying he’d smash up everything I owned. 

Obviously I threatened first and it was a total empty threat (I don’t have the money to replace it) but I want him to understand I’ve come to the end of my limit but he doesn’t see it. Our past arguments have been calm, loud, crying, reasonable, nasty, you name it I’ve done it.

so I have this friend that I’ve only really started talking to after a month. At first I thought she was pretty cool but loud, which was fine. As I got to know her better I learned that she has some medical issues which is totally fine and I tried to be there for her through them. It feels as though she uses them as an excuse to make the conversation all about her, she will interrupt and insert herself in every social interaction I have to talk about her abusive family and health issues. 

I have a hard time believing her all the time because I was FaceTiming my then girlfriend one night and she burst into my room (I’m in college)  which is okay but a little annoying so I introduced them and my friend was telling my then girlfriend about how rude I was to her and called me a racist for complimenting her cooking (I just said that she was good at cooking because she made me food).  I feel like a dickhead for not believing her but it seems like it’s a pattern. 

I also came out to her as trans (I’m not very open with this) and she ignored it to talk about herself. It really bothered me because I told her that I’ve only told about 10 people ever so it was a big deal to me. 

To make things more complicated she has hinted that she had a massive crush on someone and the details she gave me seem to point to me. My roommate also agrees that she seems to be talking about me and agrees that she is making things awkward. She also said that she wanted to get a tattoo of my star sign along with some other star signs. It’s starting to creep me out. 

Like today she told everyone that she was harassed by someone on campus so I asked some details and encouraged her to go to the front desk and try to get the person in trouble.

We are planning to move out on February 1st because the lease ends. We are going to work in a new building. Last sunday, the tenant, without my knowledge, called the cable company.

this might be kind of long so bear with me. tldr will be at the bottom.

for background, all of the people involved in this, including myself, are 14-15 yrs old and freshmen in high school. k+x have been friends for about a year, me+x have been friends since we were little kids, and me+k only became friends in mid december. 

k is an immigrant from the UAE and has some severe family problems. he’s pulled small stunts before, but they’ve all usually been pushed aside. 2 days ago, i personally sat him down and expressed that i’m not comfortable with him using the n word around me because he is not of african/african american descent and he doesn’t use it in a friendly way, he uses it as an insult. he’s always acted like he’s entitled to everything, talked over us and then yelled at us for not listening, blatantly degraded our friends (calling one of our close friends useless as a “joke”, saying he wished one of our friends who was recently hospitalized for an eating disorder was skinnier, etc)

today during our school lunch, me, x, and k, were at a store to get food/drinks. we had already previously gotten lunch at a fast food chain nearby. k has owed me somewhere around 20 bucks for a few weeks now, but still continues to beg me to buy him candy/chips every day. 

i was talking to the cashier and paying for drinks for me and x when k ran up to x and started to pull at the fast food bag in her hand, yelling over and over “since you never pay me back” and “since [op] won’t buy me anything give me that.” it got to the point where x had her wrists crossed over her chest and he was pulling at them, yelling in the line of a crowded store. 

i have adhd and severe anxiety, one of my triggers is when multiple people are yelling at me while i’m trying to talk to a cashier/server (which surprisingly happens alot). k knows this.

x is my best friend, and the minute i noticed what was going on i started to overload, i snapped, and said “k, stop. stop! now!” which ended in 2 of the store’s employees physically pulling him off of her (she wasn’t hurt, he just wouldn’t let go of her wrists). 

once we left the store, i pretty much immediately (face to face) broke the friendship off, telling him that i am not going to let him anywhere near me anymore. x said the same. 

since then, he’s been spreading far and wide that x+me are lying about what happened (even though there were at least 20 other students from our school who saw what happened) and generally just making me feel like an asshole for getting him in trouble and then ending the friendship without even thinking.

tldr; k got yelled at and grabbed x because op wouldn’t buy him what he wanted, op snapped and told him to stop which resulted in store employees physically pulling k off of x. op ended the friendship right after this happened. k has been spreading rumors saying that op and x are lying about what he did, now op feels like the asshole.",aita for putting a stop to toxic behavior and ending the friendship right after?

Today, they were struggling for cover on my department (which they had known about all week) and I said to my supervisor as a *very* last resort and if they couldnt find anybody else id be willing to work the shift. It would have been 9.5 hours total. I asked this an hour and a half before my shift ended.
20 minutes before my shift ended he said he needed me to work it. But he hadnt called any of my colleagues who werent in to see if they could cover. I really didnt want to work the shift because it was almost the end of my current shift and my supervisor didnt try anybody else first.  I told him id try and call my mum (I dont drive) to see if she could pick me up after work. I said I couldnt get hold of her, because I was annoyed he didnt try anybody else first but I feel like an asshole because I shouldnt have said it in the first place. If he had asked me the night before I would have worked the shift. 

Can someone let me know if I was the asshole?",AITA for leaving my work understaffed for closing shift
702,AmItheAsshole,"The first time my sister got pregnant I did a gender reveal for her and her husband. I made a cupcake with blue inside. They called me saying the cake was yellow and I had to tell them over the phone. Their son is now 6.

EDIT: For clarification, this son is also the nephew mentioned in the title and the first gender reveal I did was just a cupcake for them to eat alone, not a party.

When my sister told me she was pregnant again I remembered the first time, and asked if I could have a redo. She didn't want to have a gender reveal party but I pointed out that she didn't do a baby shower the first time and people gave her shit for it so why not do a baby shower/gender reveal party. She wasn't sure but I said I'd take care of everything, both in terms of finances and planning, and she agreed. It didn't take much, just grabbed some paper plates and ordered a few pizzas, but the part I put serious work into was the reveal.

I made a tower of 36 cupcakes. All had gold cases and chocolate icing, 35 were yellow cake, 1 was blue. Whoever finds the blue cake announces the gender. It took a couple hours to make and decorate all 36.

I invited just family. Our parents, some cousins, uncles, aunts, and nana. 12 people RSVPd yes, and 2 of them had kids. Didn't do a headcount there were about 15 people, 3 children. As people arrived I explained the reveal and they all thought it was cute. My sister arrived, late, with her husband and my nephew, I explained it to them, and my sister thanked me for throwing everything together.

The party was going well, about an hour in and everyone had a cupcake but no one found the blue cupcake yet (I put it right at the bottom of the tower), I was talking to a cousin, and then there's a thud, followed by a series of smaller thuds. I turn around and the 6 year old nephew has toppled the tower onto the table and is punching the cupcakes.

Dad is nearest and he pulls my nephew away, but not before he punches the correct one, revealing the blue cake. Mum and dad clean up my nephew and my sister and her husband clean the table.

I yell ""what the fuck?"" Sister tells me not to swear. I say ""I'll swear if I fucking want to swear why did he do that?"" Sister says he's a kid, kids do dumb stuff and he was just excited, leave him alone. I tell her there's dumb and then there's this, and he should know better. Sister thanks everyone for coming, thanks me for the party and she, the kid, and her husband leave. Within half an hour everyone else has left and I'm clearing up alone.

I figured my sister would get over it but the party was last weekend and today when I offered to bring the gifts mum and dad forgot to their house my sister says ""that depends, are you going to scream at my son again?"" I tell her he was being a brat, she says he was being a kid, and I say ""whatever, we'll sort it out another time"".

I don't see anything I did as unreasonable but my sister apparently hates my guts now and everyone is siding with her.

AITA? How?",AITA for blowing up at my nephew when he ruined a gender reveal party?
703,AmItheAsshole,"So I (F19) ran off from my fathers (39M) house at 16. This whole situation still hurts me and I feel that I can never be as close to my father as I once was.
Background- I moved in with my dad at 13 because my mom had some ongoing drug abuse problems. My dad live with my stepmother (37F) and two younger brothers. Me and my stepmom never really got along and she would always make snarky comments about me under her breath when my dad wasn’t around or just sigh when I was in the same room as her. I really didn’t feel comfortable being around her and I secluded myself in my room often. 
I kind of got to the point where I would rather live with my mom in a household where I felt loved from every angle instead of feeling like I was trapped in my own home. My dad hasn’t really been the most affectionate guy and would rather buy ones love. That just wasn’t me. 
Unfortunately I planned running off to my moms house around the same time I got suspended for skipping school. So it made it look like I ran away because my dad punished me. That just wasn’t true. 

I was home that day from school and had a friend pick me up. My stepmom was in the living room and I decided I would leave any belongings that my dad gave to me because he would pull the “I bought you this I bought you that” card to manipulate me. I remember crawling out my window with my favorite clothes and getting in my friends car and stopping at the phone store to get a cheap $50 prepaid to get me by for the time being and went to my moms. (She still has full custody) maybe a day later my dad realized I was gone and sent me messages on Facebook calling me a spoiled brat and that just because I couldn’t have things my way doesn’t mean I can just run from my problems. He never gave me a chance to explain why I ran away. I even went back to another school to get my education to prove that I could do it and I cared about my future.  I was just honestly tired of feeling unloved and like I wasn’t good enough in the eyes of my stepmother. It was an awful feeling being there.

Sorry I know this was long but if anyone has any questions I can explain further to your comments. So reddit AITA for running away?",AITA -running away
704,AmItheAsshole,"I work at a very small company (12 people total) and we have a machine shop we work in on occasion where we do maintenance on our equipment and build new things. One of the things we were developing needed a very specific kind of tape of a certain material. We had a printed diagram of the piece of tape we needed. I was tasked with getting the product and I called the manufacturer and 3 different vendors, all of whom either didn't answer or didn't have the product. By the end of the day, I had only been able to get an email sent to the manufacturer.

The next day I was in the shop again along with a coworker (K) who wasn't in the shop the day before. K asked what I was doing and I told him about how I wasn't able to get in touch with anyone who could help me with getting the tape. He had other work at the time but wasn't too busy so although I didn't ask, he decided he would try to help me. While I was busy trying to find other distributors K called the same places I had called the day before with the same results and at one point, he read to them a number on the drawing that had nothing to do with how the product would be labelled by a seller (I think it was for our own internal use but I don't remember). Seeing that he'd just been repeating what I did the day before for a while at this point, I took the drawing while he was holding it and told him ""K, just chill for now"". He then looked at me and asked ""Is there a problem?"" and I just said ""no, I got it"".

I thought that would be the end of that, but after dinner when we were both back in our hotel rooms, K started sending me texts. I'll just show them here ([texts](https://imgur.com/a/OSx8Lvg)). To put them in context, the company does work for clients in oil refineries.

To be honest, when K texted that he was going to report everything to management, I laughed out loud. Sure enough, the next day when we were in the shop again, K told me that he had talked to our director about what happened. I asked him if I was going to hear about this from our director and he told me I would. It's since been two months and I still haven't heard anything from the director. My best guess is that either K didn't actually say anything or our director thought this was a nonissue.

705,AmItheAsshole,"My fiance's (F) work throws a lot of compulsory social events that involve a dress code. Usually 1 a month, often 2 or 3. I'm not one for dressing up but when he has these things I always go with him and dress according to the dress code. I have 3 passes a year to not go.

At the last fundraiser one of his coworker's wives asked me if the dress I was wearing was the same dress I wore a couple months ago to another event and I say yes. The coworker hears this and asks F if he can't afford to buy me a new dress. F thought the coworker was a dick but later told me he was embarrassed by the ""joke"" and asked me to get a new dress for next time.

Here's the thing. F makes more than double what I make. The only reason I can afford as many dresses and shoes and accessories as I currently can is that he pays 2x what I do in everything else. He suggested this initially because he wanted a bigger place that I couldn't afford to pay half on, and we've been living like this for a year now.

However, every event, which is minimum once a month, requires a new dress, new jewelry, a new bag and new shoes. Recently I've also started to get my hair done professionally before the event, because his bosses boss's wife and I get on well, and she asked me a few months ago to start getting ready with her, which means going to the same salon she does and getting my hair and nails done for the event while she gets hers done. I wanted to stop doing this after the first time, but F asked me to continue because he thinks if I talk him up to the wife she'll talk him up to the boss. There's been occasions where getting ready with her has also involved going with her to choose her dress, and she's picked me out a dress/bag/shoes for the event and I've had to get them.

Just for the last event, the cost of hair, nails, dress, shoes, bag and jewelry came to over £600. There is an average of 2 events per month, so £1200 per month average to go to these events. I make about £1800 a month. Living expenses, even with him paying significantly more than I do, come to about £500.

I collected up my receipts, handed them to him and said ""look, I'm fine with coming to your things, but I need you to help me out with them. You know how much I make, and all of my disposable income is going into this. If you want me in all new stuff every month, then I need you to pitch in. If the budget doesn't stretch that far then I'm just going to have to wear my old dresses.""

He then started going through the receipts, asking if I really needed this or that. He then said that he already pays out a shedload each month and he's going to need me to keep spending as normal. I said that he needs to at least partially fund the next outfit or I'm using my pass.

AITA?

UPDATE: We have a new agreement. He will pay for everything going forward for his work events, and the salon appointments as they are for him. If he is ever required to get clothing for my work or social events I will similarly cover the cost, but that has happened once in the 4 years we've been together. I am going to keep going to these work events because we are in a relationship, one we are going to be in for the rest of our lives. I will continue to go to these events and talk him up 1-3 nights per month for as long as he works there because he needs me to do that, and he will come to my work and social events because I need him to do that.

Just to add: I've looked into clothing rentals, tried a few services available here a while back, none of them were great, but I got a lot of suggestions for ones that operate in my area that I could try so I will be giving it another go. It's also worth noting that I would probably get away with re-wearing some of the dresses I wore this time last year or earlier now, as it's been over a year.

Edit for emphasis: *please* stop telling me to reconsider my engagement. I appreciate that internet strangers are worried about my relationship but I'm a big girl, I know what I'm doing. Can everyone please chill on telling me to end a loving, healthy, functional relationship that I intend to be in for the rest of my life over my fiance not realizing how expensive women's clothing is? Kindly chill, lads.",AITA for expecting my fiance to pay for me to get ready for his events?
706,AmItheAsshole,"I work on a relatively small team in a large corporation. One of our coworkers passed suddenly early this week and their visitation hours are Thursday and Friday this week.

&amp;#x200B;

In their personal life, this person was very generous and cared about others. In their work life, this person was extremely difficult to deal with and we had a strained relationship, to the point of me requesting to not be put on projects with them. But again, outside of work, they were a good person. The funeral home is over an hour from where I live, I have an infant and toddler that I need to take care of during two of the visitation periods and an appointment during the third visitation period.

707,AmItheAsshole,"I have a friend (“Jack”) in university under a similar major as mine who discovered a source for all the answers to future assignments in the class we share via a mutual friend who took the class prior. I’ve known Jack for over a year now and he has a work ethic not dissimilar to a dying sloth, spending most of his time getting high or impregnating various random women (not really, but really). 

Our friendship so far has consisted mostly of me doing favors for Jack including but not limited to lending money, sharing food, and providing rides. While I don’t necessarily feel obligated to do these things for him, I understand his story coming from a foreign place and the struggle of trying to stay in America, so I usually don’t mind doing favors but definitely know how to limit it.

Jack has recently become the recipient of a complete file of all the future assignments in  the class we share and provided it to me as well.

Today I used one of the file assignments to draft my own work, not copying and pasting anything, but basing off of the solutions I got from it. As it is meant to be several pages long, it still took a while for me to do and I learned stuff from it but my paper looks nothing like the assignment from the files.

*Today, Jack also used one of the file assignments, not to draft his own work but to change the names on the papers and write his own name in place of them.*

In theory, there’s not much objectively wrong with this idea as it is mostly mathematics throughout the paper but I noticed as soon as he used my computer to print out the work that he had almost 20 pages for the assignment. This was definitely not right because the assignment took only 4-5 pages for me. As I was going through what he printed to see how he managed to get to 20 pages, I noticed he included work well past what we were supposed to do. If the instruction said to stop at problem 4, he went to problem 16. This would cause problems were he to turn it in because not only would his graphs made by computer-generated random numbers match exactly the student whose paper it was before, but also because many of the characters on the paper became those weird question mark box emojis or completely unreadable.

I noticed all the errors he made and was about to say something to him about how erroneous the whole paper was when I realized two things. 

One: he used 20 pages of my paper to print what was essentially someone else’s work. 

Two: he smelled heavy of weed. Again. For the third time I saw him—consecutively—this week. I don’t think he would’ve fixed it unless I made him.

Even though he apologized for using so much of my paper and promised to pay me back for it somehow, I decided to let him turn in 20 pages of shit instead of intervening to save his grade (and possibly his enrollment). 

TL;DR: I willingly let my friend turn in awful-quality copied work even though he sourced me with the same work he copied.

So a little info, my (27m) wife (25f) and i had my LO(3F) a few years back when my mother and i were not on speaking terms as we’ve always had a rocky relationship since my parents divorce. We started getting back in touch when my LO turned 1 and things have been alright since. Around this same time i started a new, better paying job that ive been able to advance in and am now making double what i was when my wife and i first married which made us much more financially stable.

Forward to about a year ago my mother was saying how they would love to come visit and see LO (who she has only seen in person three times) but since she had lost her job they didnt have the money for her to come see us (about a 4.5hr drive). My wife and I talked and agreed that we would pay for their gas, cook dinners at home and they could stay with us at our house so it wouldnt really cost them anything. I asked her that night and she instantly shot it down saying that they couldnt/wouldnt take money from us and they would just have to wait until they were able. Months pass and i would occasionally extend the offer again and still the same result.

Well yesterday my mom called after work all excited to tell me how my sister (22F) and her husband (?m) had bought her and my SD tickets to fly out and see them (In New Mexico, mom lives in Pennsylvania) in March and paid for all their expenses. She kept going on about how she’s so happy and cant believe sister would do this for her. At this point i was a bit upset/angry so i asked why it was ok to accept sister’s money to visit but not any of our offers? Her response : “Well we figured you wouldnt be too well off after and would be hurting for money.” She then went on to say how its not fair that im angry at something that makes her this happy and i should just be happy for her and im just an ass like my father. After that i was too pissed off so i cut the call short with some excuse.

710,AmItheAsshole,"My girlfriend and I are staying in my brother's place for free. My brother is out of the country and generously letting us stay in his place for free but asked multiple times for us to take good care of it. It's his first home and he's already really ""anal"" about his things, so coming into it I really wanted to do a good job to thank him for being so generous to us.

My gf and I have already gotten into a few 'fights' about this. The first time it was because I reminded her several times to please use a coaster (per his list of requests that he left), she didn't and left a permanent water ring on his coffee table. The second time she forgot to take her shoes off (another request) and tracked mud onto his rug. I got stressed out/a little annoyed and asked her to please, PLEASE be more mindful. She says I'm being way too uptight and anxious and it's not a big deal and these things can be fixed.

She was drinking bubble tea and eating in the living room and watching TV. I already am leery about her eating on the couch because she's prone to spilling things, so I said, ""Please be careful not to spill."" She snarkily pretended to spill her food by jerking the container in her hands like she almost dropped it and said ""thanks but I'm not a kid.""

Then she sucked up her tapioca bubbles too fast through the straw and inhaled one, choked, and then spat/sprayed her milk tea all over the couch.

I was across the room and only saw her spit the drink out over the couch. At the moment I probably knew she would only do that while choking, but my first gut reaction was to yell ""BABE!!!"" in shock and I guess annoyance/distress. I didn't actually see her choke. Of course once I realized she choked, I ran over to make sure she was OK, but it was a brief instance, not like she was gagging and choking and coughing, she dislodged the tapioca the moment she spit it out. It was like a spit take on TV. After making sure she was okay I ran to get a wet rag to wipe up the milk tea. Did my best but due to the fabric of the couch there will probably be a little bit of a stain.

Now she's super pissed at me for yelling ""BABE!!!"" in a semi-angry/accusing way when she choked because ""she could have died"" and all I cared about was the couch. She's not talking to me and posted on her facebook about how I'd ""trade her life for some things"" which is obviously not true.

711,AmItheAsshole,"My dad is an alcoholic who is in denial. Ever since he retired a few years ago, the boredom of retirement and other psychological issues have really strained our relationships. My sister and I support our parents financially and he believes that we perceive ourselves to be superior to them (since we provide for them), and because of that we have stopped listening to him. The truth is that we have our own lives and while we try and support him emotionally as much as possible, he can't order us around to do things we don't want to do. We are both in our 30s now with families of our own.  Both me and my sister are extremely fortunate to provide for them without much financial pain and are more than willing to do so after all that they have done for us.

We are an Asian family and I am getting married to a non-Asian here in the States. Since we plan to have a wedding in the States, most of my extended family back in Asia couldn't make it. So, we decided to fly over there and host a party (like a mini reception, but before the wedding). The event went fairly smoothly despite my dad's drunken behavior.  Things took a turn for the worse the following day when we were traveling in a car, and we asked him to please give us a few minutes of silence in the car so my fiancee could admire the scenery. He had been rambling (while drunk of course), and my fiancee was incredibly polite. He started yelling and would not stop. He also attempted to jump out of the car while it was moving. We had to escape the situation and at the next rest stop, I and my fiancee split. We got a separate car for ourselves.

Word of this got to all of my extended family and they had a meeting (an intervention?) with my dad. Based on what my mom said (who was there), there was no remorse or regret on his part for any of his actions for the past 2 weeks. However, there seemed to be some sort of resolution on his part. He promised to not drink during my upcoming wedding in the States (it is going to be dry any way) and promised to fully stop drinking shortly thereafter. Both my sister and I are not convinced this is sincere, because he has done this before without much effect. He is convinced he is not an alcoholic, because he can stop drinking 30-40 days at a time. We suspect he will do this again. Recently, he has also been caught sneaking drinks without any one noticing.

My extended family thinks that I should invite him to the wedding because he promised to be sober. I am not convinced he will remain sober, and his general psychological issues (i.e. his persecution complex) are still quite apparent while sober.  I suspect he is doing this to appease my mom (who he desperately needs in his life). I am completely torn because I don't want to make the situation worse for my mom (who lives with him) and dis-inviting him could indeed do that.

now, recently every time she called me ""bau"" i'll reply with ""cerewet"" which means slightly demeaning term for ""big mouth"" or ""someone who talked too much"" but far less demeaning compare to swear words. and this, just like the logic above, is somewhat true. she always tells me something i already know despite it should be obvious i already know it, like wash the vegetables before cutting it or turn off the stove after you finished using it, etc; she repeats the point she has made multiple times, verbatim to boot, she doesn't even paraphrase it; she likes to chat with strangers who comes to our store about various thing including me (it's not super personal stuff but it used to be worse when i was a kid, i'm very introverted so i don't really like being talked on); and she often bad talk our employee when they're not present (thou she does has merit in this one as sometimes our employee not doing the right work), who knows what she talk about me when i was gone (this is just me speculating. she very well might be never talk behind my back, however i doubt it). those are just small example of her less than good behavior.

obviously she'll scold me how i disrespected her, saying she's my mother, that she gave birth to me, without her i'll not be in this world, and she's been taking care of me until now. to be honest i do feel bad to calling her out. i do tried different methods before, but in retrospect it feels like i'm just trying to annoy her as much as she annoys me. and i have tried talking to her but it isn't really working. she'll stop but will just forget the talking ever happens in couple of days or just outright deny it.

718,AmItheAsshole,"I'm 18, my brother is 17. Throwaway for obvious reasons, story is a bit long, sorry.

Last January, my mom passed away. My little brother.. he just changed. My brothers, my mom and dad, and I, would go out to eat, have movie nights, cook together. We did everything together.

After she had passed away, things were really rough. My older brother grew quiet, my dad began drinking very heavily, I couldn't sleep or eat. My little brother on the other hand, had decided that he wanted to be a rebel.

He decided to take my mom's car and try to make it his own.

He started taking the car to work, started refusing to going to school. We got a letter about truancy for him. He would sleep all day or pick up his friends from school and run around town.

Social services ended up getting involved because he STILL refused to go to school. They talked with our family letting us know our dad could get in trouble for it.

He got pulled over and luckily, the officer gave him a warning and followed him home. Officer explained my brother isn't allowed to drive because he had no permit or license.

I got upset with my brother and let him know he got lucky. He rolled his eyes and said he wouldn't drive.

But, a few days later, he was already behind the wheel again.

He got pulled over a couple days ago by State Patrol. He is in trouble for driving without a license, speeding (75 in a 60), and driving with nobody over the age of 21.

He told my dad and I, ""I got in trouble for speeding. I know I shouldn't speed but I only took it seriously because I got pulled over.""

Why isn't dad saying anything? He says that he doesn't want his son to be upset with him and he's just being a teenager.

I decided to take it into my own hands and when my brother returned from his girlfriend's house last night, I told him that he's not driving anymore.

We got into a massive fight because he said he fixed the car and so he has the right to do whatever he wants, and that if he gets in trouble it's on him.

I told him, no, you're 17, you're going to get dad in trouble because you're still a minor, and when he goes to court, they will also look at his schooling. I said that I wanted the keys to make sure he wasn't driving and he refused.

I told him it wasn't an option.

My older brother came into our argument, saying that my little brother is having a hard time with mom's passing and this is his way of handling it. I didn't say anything because that could be true, and if it is, I don't want him to feel wrong about his feelings, but this is not how to cope.

I told him that no matter the excuse, he has to go to school and isn't allowed to drive. He yelled and threw the keys, storming off.

I don't wanna see my brother go to jail or my dad, but I feel like it wasn't in my place to say anything after my mom was brought up. Am I the asshole?

Edit: Sorry, I should've put this in. A few comments are suggesting therapy. All of us are in therapy except my little brother, he says he doesn't want to talk to some stranger about his problems. He was talking to a school counselor before he stopped going to school. Not sure about it anymore.",AITA for getting after my brother?
719,AmItheAsshole,"I own a NY 4B/1.5BA spacious house in a nice area close in my city w/ off-street parking and utilities included. I've spent close to $20K on the house this year. All the bells and whistles of a modern apartment. All my own physical effort. I ask $700/mo, not cheap, but a good deal for the location.

I live there and have 2 tenants/roommates. The new tenant is a random, she seemed like a good fit + responsible. Minus her prior renting didn't end amicably as she didn't get along with her roommate. Red flag, but i looked past it. She signed a 12 month lease 2 months ago.

i've bent over backward for her. Shes a light sleeper, so i sealed her door. Her door didn't lock (100 years old), so i got new locks for everyone. She wanted a whiteboard for communicating? Done. vacuum is too small for a big house? I'll get a new one. Some requests/complaints have seemed super ridiculous, but I obliged.

I've been redoing the bath: It's nearly done - i put in a granite sink,  wall tile, and it's looking pretty nice. only caveat is that it was inactive for times when i work on it, but usually when nobody is home. Everyone still gets to shower every day/night. 2 weeks ago, I noticed new pink stains in the new granite. small, but noticeable and can't be removed,  i asked if anyone spilled something. Of course - no one confessed.  I let it go cause shit happens. I didn't accuse her. But I'm positive it is the new tenant as she has a fruit puree in the fridge matching the color.

1 week later - the dryer breaks while she uses it. It's pretty new. So I message the group: ""hey, the dryer is broken badly; I've bought a brand new washer and dryer ($1400), it'll be here next week. the old one has been stuffed full of clothes and overloaded many times, so if this one breaks, it'll have to come from deposits.""

she throws a fit, says i'm blaming her. I said it's not blaming, but calling notice to costly damage and if I don't mention it, says that I don't care about it. she says that she'd be better seeking a different housing. She has a no-sublet and early termination clause.

she thinks i'm being unfair. Oddly - she's talked of buying a house soon and is actively looking; i think shes making a case to leave so she can buy a new house. There are 0 legal grounds to breaking a lease.

her 3 options:

move out in a month - be on the hook for 6 months - security

move out by Sept., be on the hook for 1 month - security.

move out anytime from now till Dec., but at the time of moveout will need 3 months rent - security.

AITA?

721,AmItheAsshole,"I’ll just jump right into it. I currently work part-time with a company that I genuinely do like. I enjoy the work I do, the work the company does, and my coworkers/superiors. I’ve been there a little over a year. 

The problem is the pay rate and number of hours. The position I got hired for is generally meant for college students, of which I am not. I am almost 30 and live in a very expensive city. I have tried to make up the pay difference with side jobs and freelance work, but no matter how much I did I still found myself falling behind on bills and unable to make ends meet. I’ve talked to my current job about the possibility of becoming full-time and gaining benefits, and they turned down that idea (which I understand is their right). I haven’t had health insurance in almost two months, and have generally spent every day in panic mode trying to figure out what to do financially. 

I got a job offer with a different company for a similar albeit higher up position that would not only be full-time with benefits but would end up paying over triple what I’m making now, which is amazing. With this paycheck I can stabilize myself in a month or two. The problem is that they’ve requested I start on 2/3 instead of 2/10, which would leave me giving my current employer only a week’s notice. The new employer isn’t pressuring me in any way, they said it’s completely fine if I begin on 2/10 but for various reasons (including a big project beginning the week of 2/10) they would like me in sooner if possible. 

I don’t want to leave my current job on bad terms, and I do want to be able to use them as a reference in the future, but truthfully I can really, really use that paycheck a week sooner (I’ll be paid weekly). I can easily wrap up/pass off any projects I have with my current job within a week, so that isn’t a concern. I have spoken with my supervisors previously about my situation, so they’re not unaware that I’ve been seeking full-time employment and need benefits. It also doesn’t help that my direct supervisor is out of the country currently and won’t be back til next week, so I’d have to inform her remotely of my rather quick departure. 

I know two-weeks notice is customary, and like I said I do like my current job, and if pay wasn’t a concern then I’d stay two weeks no problem. But I really just want to be able to breathe, and I feel like I haven’t been in months.

A year goes by and we're both single again so we decide to get back together (distance wasn't a problem anymore). Once again we ""dated"" for a few months and broke up, again. This cycle went on for the better part of our relationship until we both decided enough was enough and left it at being friends. Well this changed into FWB for a while which promptly ended once we went to our respective college. Jeff and I are also part of a club where we share a very close mutual friend group. my friendship with Jeff has always been complicated at best. Background over.

So I ended up meeting my current boyfriend ""mark"" at college and so far it's been going great. I told Jeff that I'm in a committed relationship and I've been very clear to Jeff that I don't see him in a romantic way anymore. During this conversation  Jeff also asked me if we could do some fwb things ""like old times"" to which I said no and left it at that. 

Everything was fine until Jeff sent me a picture of him in a suggestive pose and caption on it (this was about a week ago). The picture itself wasn't indecent, just suggestive. It made me feel very uncomfortable (which I expressed) and we both decided to pretend like it never happened. Before he did this he also asked if I was still dating Mark which I told him yes.

My bedroom is in the basement, so I don't use a space heater, because the basement is too wide for it to really do anything. Instead, to stay warm, I use the furnace that heats the whole house (it runs on oil, which we split evenly).

My (26f) coworker (31f) is visibly not happy with her job. I've been operating along the whole ""none of my business, not my life"" mentality since we started as new hires 2 years ago. Since I'm younger, I don't try and dish out career advice. However, it's gotten to a point where her attitude is affecting others around her. It's complicated to describe, but I'll throw some situations out below.

She's paid hourly as a researcher and has previously asked our boss if she can become salary - he's told her no, it's not something they can do. My coworker has told me about these conversations personally, and whenever she gets upset about a research assignment she often makes the comment, ""if I was salary I could work on this at home and get more done.""

The company used spreadsheets when we got hired and my coworker was tasked with finding a new database solution. She never offered a direct solution and one day last year my boss said he found a database that will work for us. (Boss is NOT familiar with tech at all). Boss kinda jumbles the roll out of new database and my coworker has told me from day one that our boss, ""ripped the baby out from her"" and all problems are ""because of (boss)."" She purposely does not treat the database as her responsibility and the rest of us are just randomly entering information because no one is taking leadership and directing us what to do. She even apologized to me before the holidays as the boss asked me to enter even more info in the database (when I'm not a researcher position) - she apologized for neglecting the database and also blamed our boss once again.

Anyways, recently her attitude has been dismal. One syllable responses, quiet, no conversation, muttering to herself. If our boss calls to ask about a research project, she hangs up after the call and sighs very loudly and then leaves the office for a few minutes. I'm honestly a bit worried...she's clearly not happy and I've tried to be there for her and do what I can. She doesn't report to me and we have different positions, but we work across from each other. Everyone else in the office has noticed, now I'm getting calls from other coworkers wanting research-related stuff because they're honestly a bit scared to ask my coworker.

Lily has recently had her mental health take a decline. In the last few months, she started skipping classes in order to complete college apps and hw. I warned Lily that was a poor decision, but she ended up skipping almost all her classes one week then getting sick and missing the next week. 

Also, Lily missed the application deadline for her dream college, and ever since she has cried every day. It has started to put a strain on our friend group, and some have admitted to me  that they are avoiding eating lunch in our regular place in order to avoid her inevitable meltdown.

Lily is also obsessed with keeping a 4.0 gpa and regularly talks about how worried she is that she might get one B and “ruin her gpa”. I don’t mean to take that to heart, but as someone who has gotten Bs, I don’t appreciate hearing that my gpa is ruined. Somehow, despite her skipping she still has perfect grades. My patience finally reached its limit today, when she started full on sobbing during a quiz. Now, she has a great grade in this class, which one quiz will certainly not change, but when she saw a question she couldn’t answer (because she skipped the day the study guides were handed out and didn’t check online) she started sobbing. It was very uncomfortable for everyone in the room, and the teacher had leave to take her to a counselor. I told her that one quiz wouldn’t make or break her grade before, but she lost it as soon as she saw the paper. 

I was talking to my mom about Lily’s meltdown in class, and she asked if I was going to text her and ask if she was ok. I said that I didn’t want to,  as it would drag me into her mess, and she seemed very surprised, to say the least. I feel bad for not checking in on Lily, but I just can’t handle her stress level anymore. I also have finals and college stuff to do.

735,AmItheAsshole,"I was 18 when my daughter was born, I was a kid myself and had no idea what I was doing. My girlfriend at the time was 17 and it all became a bit too much for her and she passed on. Between her passing and having to deal with a baby I broke down myself and ended up moving back in with my parents and working dead end jobs whilst they raised the baby. After 3 years of feeling sorry for myself I decided to get my life back in order. I became more involved with my daughter, started taking classes at a local university and filling up my time with work to save money up. Things were great, I graduated and got a proper job and tried to raise my daughter properly.

We all lived together in my parent's house and were a happy little family, but when my daughter was 11 my mother was diagnosed with cancer and passed away shortly after. My father became sick and pretty much emotionless, so I ended up having to look after him and my daughter whilst working. I tried my best but I had no idea how to raise a teenage daughter and I admit I was stricter than most parents. No boys, a nightly curfew, no partying, no drinking, focus on your studies etc. In short I didn't want her to end up like me.

When she hit 18 she decided to go to university and chose one the other side of the country. I offered to help with funding and expenses so she could focus on studies. She wanted her freedom and after a rather hurtful tirade, that by this time I was used to, she packed her stuff and left. I tried calling, sending texts, sending e-mails but everything went unanswered. I contacted the university in the end but they couldn't share her information as she'd expressly told them not to. I realised that my daughter hated me and wanted nothing to do with me. She still spoke to her aunt and uncle so I know she was ok, but she was adamant that she never wanted to speak to me. I passed on updates to them with how her grandfather was and left it at that. 

6 years later and I haven't spoken to her, I know she graduated and started working a full-time job and that she's doing well. I get sent a few pictures of her from her uncle/aunt (on her mother's side) and some updates but that's it.

Then at the end of last year I get an e-mail from her. No asking how I am, no inquiring about her grandfather. Just a short message that she's getting married and that they're buying a house together and she'd like some help with the deposit. I have the money to help her and I gladly would, but I also want to speak to my daughter, I just want to talk to her about how things are. I replied that I'd help her out if she'd come to visit, or at least talk to me on the phone. She refused and asked again for help. I told her no, not until she and I talked.

She replied ""Thanks for nothing"" and hasn't replied to my e-mails. AITA here? or rather did I do the right thing by essentially holding the money ransom in the hopes she'd talk to me?",AITA for not helping my daughter buy a house?
736,AmItheAsshole,"Background: My family is me, my dad, my mom (44F) and two older half-brother (27M/29M) who are from my dads first marriage. My oldest brother is engage and is getting married in February. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost a year (we met at freshmen year of college). I came out as bisexual after Christmas and my whole family was supportive. Although, my dad doesn’t like talking about it but he did say that he still loves me. My BF also met my family, but only once. It went well but was awkward with him and my dad. Nothing though gave me any bad signs. 

After coming out, I asked to tell my grandparents. My dad said he would tell his parents eventually. I also posted on FB that I was in a relationship with my BF. My dad doesn’t have FB (that comes up later).

So, my brothers fiancé planned a family dinner to celebrate before the wedding. This includes many of her family members and many of my family members. She texted me saying she saw my FB post about my BF and told me I could bring him. Me and him live at our college, but we were fine driving an hour to the dinner party (this past Saturday). I called my dad and told him I was bringing my BF and ask if he told his parents yet. He said I will (this was 5 days before the dinner). 

Well, my BF and I arrived to the dinner and my dad quickly ran to me. He told me that I would have to make my BF go home. My dad wasn’t “able” to tell him parents. I told him that I would do it, but he said I can’t do it now because it would ruin the party.

He’s my issues, I agree that the party wasn’t the right place to do it. But, I kept telling my dad I could tell his parents. He kept saying he should do it. 2) if he wasn’t going to do it, he should of told me earlier and I would have gone alone. 3) my BF dorm was an hour away and his house was 45 minutes away. That would of been rude of me to tell him to go home.

So, I said hello to everyone and told my brother and his fiancé that I had to go home. So me and my BF went back to our school. My mom and brothers are staying out of it. And my dad said I was rude.

737,AmItheAsshole,"So a few weeks ago a coworker of mine (Alan is thr name ill use) picked up an afternoon shift at another restaurant and worked 11am-3:30pm. When he came to the restaurant I work at, he was wondering if anyone had taken his close. 

Now the manager of the kitchen im in owns the bar he worked at in the afternoon and had told Alan he would get someone to take the close so Alan wouldn't have to work another 8 hours. The problem is the manager never asked anyone at my restaurant to take the close and then lied about that to the GM.

When Alan got to work, he was asking who was closing and we all said he was as we hadnt heard anything about it. I had been wanting hours so I told him that if it wasn't a busy service over dinner than I would take the close for him. As dinner went on I made it clear that it was busier than I thought it was going to be and told him I was on the fence about it.

Once dinner was over, I told him I was too tired to take the close and I went to have a bite to eat before I went home. By the time I was done eating and having a beer some more coworkers had finished their shifts and joined me at the table. We started playing some games on our phones and someone bought me another beer. Long story short I was there until 12pm even though I had intended on leaving at 9pm.

Alan was not too happy about this since I had told him I was tired and wanted to go home. However, I dont think im an ass in this situation because I started work that day 12pm and would have worked until 1am. It would have practically been the same amount of hours (if not more) by me as it was for him. He had also said that it he had to do the close, he was okay with that but if anyone could take it, that would be great.

Ill admit it was certainly flakey of me to do but im not sure if it was an asshole move. We talked and apologized to each other a couple days later but the situation came up after a work party and I just want some outside opinions on it.

Edit: Just to keep the info clear. Alan worked 11am-3:30pm at job #1 and then 5pm-1am at job #2 while I worked 12pm-8:30pm and would have worked 12pm-1am if I took the close.

738,AmItheAsshole,"I (38m) work with a woman (60f).  My mother is part of a multiowner business.  When the USA '08 financial meltdown happened i got laid off.  She hired me...i'm now her planned successor.  We are going break away and do our own thing, but for the last decade or so its been a multiowner business.

I am now going to quote 60f, contextually, on what she says to me daily.

On using shared logins to websites:

**""If you get me locked out of the website I will kick your ass.""**

On not being familiar with a task and asking her advice on doing it rather than just letting it fall into her inbox:

**""You should already know how to do this, you went to college.  I didn't!""**

On not putting paperwork in the order she prefers:

**""If you do it again, i'm going to kick your ass.""**

On people coming into the office when sick:

**""If you get me sick I'm going to kill you.""**

also

**""I'm sick, stay away from me.""**

(She uses sick days for vacation, works when ill).

On me offering to call customers about an unexplained cash settlements form she mailed to them that had a legal deadline:

**""i marked the envelope important, if they don't act on it is their fault.  Are they children?""**

The last one, I had to badger her into giving me a list of names.  I called every single one, and the majority thanked me for calling and explaining what the hell was going on.  We got back 95% of the documents as a result of our joint work.

Further facts:

She made a customer cry by insulting her over the phone, criticizing her for being a young, single mother. 

She has made third party business reps submit warnings about her abusive language over the phone.

She bothers other people on their lunchtime. yet hers is sacrosanct.

She openly refers to herself as ""a bitch"", as if it is an excuse for her unprofessional nonsense.

I really want to give her a piece of my mind.  I'm sure that reddit would agree.  But isn't it an asshole thing to do to such a miserable person?  She isn't ""just herself"" in the office...she is that in her full life.  So of course her marriage is a problem, her kids have problems, her finances are a mess...her attitude carries over to her whole existence   I just don't know if it's right to do it.  

I feel like it is similar to kicking a sick dog.  She only lashes out because it is her nature.

739,AmItheAsshole,"Recently returned from a hellish cross-country road trip. Nothing went as planned, and there are things that happened that do not sit well with me, but I am struggling over how much to confront my friend over. 

A high school friend asked me to be their plus one to a sibling's wedding. In a moment of ludicrous optimism, I said yes and offered my vehicle for the trip (we live 20+ hours from their family). It was cheaper for us to drive than fly+get a rental car, and being able to be in control of our comings and goings was important as the family situation is toxic. 

They asked me to plan, since I have experience in planning these kinds of trips. I did so and included a budget - including gas costs based on GasBuddy and the distances being traveled. They had access to this sheet. 

I paid for half of the hotels, bought food so we wouldn't have to eat out, and up till a point, we alternated who paid gas when we had to fill up. I was the 'lucky' one who got to fill up in Cali 🤮

The trip started off on the wrong foot. Partner disregarded when I told them I wanted to leave, and we blew a tire before even leaving the state. I had to get it fully replaced. And thus started a weekend where I'm positive that if fate informs folks to turn back, it was doing its best to tell us - and the partner not caring that I had a schedule so we wouldn't be driving into the wee hours of the morning. 

They did various shopping along the way -  trinkets, spiritual items, fast food, and intoxicants. 

On the last day of the trip, their card is declined at the gas station. At this point, I am already having to use my emergency credit card to get gas when it's my turn, since the tire repair royally screwed my extra funds (I told them of this the day before). 

Turns out they had several bills charge that they thought were already taken care of, plus overdraft fees. I ended up needing to take care of gas the rest of the way. 

I feel like I paid much more into this trip than my partner did - both real money, saved money, and labor. I'm empathetic to forgetting something would auto charge - I've done it in the past myself. 
But between this and the way the partner treated me along this trip, I honestly feel used. 

I know the adult thing to do is to communicate this to them. I worry that if I do, though, they will tell me that I shouldn't have offered if I didn't want to help. They're also still dealing with the fiscal repercussions of said bills. 

If I'm going to address this with them, I would like to give them a way to make it better. I would only ask for like 60 dollars, and it would go towards paying off the emergency credit card. Both of us live paycheck to paycheck and make about the same amount of money. They have not offered to pay me back. 

TLDR - Trip expenses were not split as planned due to decisions partner made. Money was already tight for OP due to the cost of vehicle emergency. Will I be the asshole of I ask to be paid back for some of it?",WIBTA for asking a travel partner to pay me back for some expenses
740,AmItheAsshole,"My brother was recently diagnosed with late stage colon cancer and has been in hospital multiple times to get assessments and diagnostic testing. The definitive treatment is a surgery and lengthy hospital stay which costs about $25k out-of-pocket after insurance deductions, and quoted at 70% cure rate. He and my SIL are unable to afford this as they have combined debts of $40k including student loans and not eligible to take more credit. They can at most put together $5000 in time to have the surgery soon enough that it's still effective.

Throwaway because I feel really awful about the situation.

I was dating a girl I really liked for a short amount of time. I thought it was going well, but she ended things quickly stating that she didn't want a relationship at the moment. I understood and have been doing my best to move on (everything was pleasant, no arguments). We agreed to stay friends.

While I was still dating her she told me about a trip to a ski resort that my university was offering that she had signed up for so I bought a place on the trip.

They ended up throwing room parties once we were there (which she said I could go to, if I wanted). I drank a bit and got a little flirty with one of her friends. She had offered to introduce me to her. Apparently she thought I did this to spite her. This was genuinely not my intention, I thought she was completely over me based on how her interest in me had diminished before she ended things, and I was trying to help myself move on as I tend to have trouble letting go.

Later everyone went to a club and she was dancing with her other male friends, it looked like fun and I wanted to ask if I could as well (I had never been to a club before, I only recently turned of age) It was pretty crowded and I thought that the crowds were pushing us apart. I kept trying to get her attention and she got uncomfortable, and apparently cried in the bathroom. Her friends asked me to leave. I tried apologizing and through text but recieved no response. I don't think her friends are upset at me because they still invited me to go skiing with them the next day (the guy who asked me to leave actually came back to my room to make sure I was ok, I was very distraught when this all happened and felt horrible), but I feel like they are all secretly annoyed at me. I will admit that I was probably too persistent and should have taken a hint that she was actually avoiding me instead of not realizing I was there (I will admit I am a bit socially lacking as my living conditions in high school prevented me from really forming a social life). If I had gotten her attention and she said no I would have understood and moved on. 

I spoke with my therapist about this (I am diagnosed with severe depression, on meds and the whole nine yards) and he said that I shouldn't feel guilty because I had no malicious intent and nothing had happened that she would refuse to speak to me all of a sudden so I had no reason to think she was avoiding me. Another therapist on campus told me the same thing when I had a follow up appt from an earlier crisis. Nothing had happened between us that she would refuse to talk to me, we were chatting before the club pleasantly so this did spark confusion in my mind. I feel very conflicted now and really wish for her forgiveness and hope she is ok, I have not been in contact with her since but this has been really stressing me out for several days now to the point where I wake up several times a night thinking about it.

746,AmItheAsshole,"EDIT HEADLINE: AITA for refusing TO invite...

I(19f) have three close friends i have known for years, we all graduated together in 2019. All summer long we were constantly hanging out as a group of four or sometimes our male friends tagged along.

Then autumn came and one girl decided to go on a three months long vacation (she left in december) and the second girl is taking a gap year and currently not in our country. That left me and the third girl, let's call her Amy, on our own.

Amy and I grew a lot closer since our closest friends moved away and even though both of us still have other friends/friend groups we are closest to each other.

In december, shortly after the second girl left, Amy and I promised to always tell each other about weekend plans/group hangouts so noone has to be alone.
I kept my promised, Amy not so much.

I always told Amy about any plans i had and always invited me along, but Amy didn't. Especially when she was hanging out as group with the male friends mentioned above she didn't seem to care about inviting me. After the first time i asked her about the promise we made and she said that since it was so spontaneous she forgot. I accepted that.

But in the following weeks that happened again and my breaking point happened last weekend when i saw on snapchat that Amy and our entire friend group were having a bar night, nobody invited me.

A little while ago, he was cleaning up a mess he made in my bedroom and found a bottle of vitamin B12. It was recently filled but I no longer take them. He opened the bottle and preceded to take one out to drink. I immediately stopped him and told him he wasn’t allowed to take anything that belongs to me without asking.

I would have let it go but then he really tried to argue with me. I said “you should have asked me. It belongs to me. You don’t understand that?” He then says “I understand that You’re not taking them.” As if that’s justification for taking something without asking. I should note that one reason why I got so annoyed is because this isn’t the first time he’s taken something without asking. Every time he does this, we end up having the same conversation.

for the most part, it's usually the case that i'm unable to attend these socials because of my shifts. i usually work a night shift at my designated care home either the day before the social, or the night of the social. if i work a night the day before the social, i'm usually eager to spend the rest of the following day catching up on rest. this means that even though i'm not working, i'm not attending the socials, which means i need to reiterate to my friends why i'm not able to go.

my friends understand my job, and that i work nights occasionally, but from their perspective, i can understand why they might be put out by me constantly not being able to go, especially because it's usually last minute for me to say i won't be going, which i understand must be frustrating. i also would understand if they feel thar i'm using work to get out of spending time with them, though they're extremely understanding and caring so i don't think they would think that at all, but i can't help but feel confused about whether or not i'm being too sensitive or whether i should suck it up and attend anyway?",AITA for ducking out of social events with my friends due to tiredness?
751,AmItheAsshole,"My friends and I have been in the same group since we were kids, so we know pretty much everything about each other. There's one girl, Gina, who's on the looser side and sleeps with a ton of people casually. None of us mind, of course, and she's really cool with it. 

She once told us a story about how she slept with 3 different dudes in one day and that story kinda stuck, cause there are some pretty funny tidbits. I've heard her repeat it many times in many settings and I've heard people in our group tease her about it even more often. But as I said, Gina's cool and always takes it in stride and has a laugh about it. 

We were all hanging out a few days ago and apart from the people in our core group, there were also a few extras. A couple of girlfriends (mine included), a boyfriend and some guys that weren't in our group (friends of friends and such). As I learned afterwards, Gina had really fancied one of those new guys for quite some time and wanted to pursue something with him.

Someone was telling a story at one point and I made a pun about Gina and her 3 guys (it's pretty much untranslatable in English, so I won't even try), which got a big laugh all around, except by the people who had never heard her story. That kinda put Gina on the spot because these people wanted to get in on the joke, but she didn't feel like sharing this time.

She spent the rest of the night not talking to me or my girlfriend and she's apparently still angry at me, cause she hasn't responded to my and my girlfriend's attempts to contact her. That's when our friends explained that she was interested in someone there and that I probably doomed her with that joke, though they think it will pass.

I realize I put her on the spot and that, in all likelihood, I blew up her chances with that guy, but a) that wasn't my intention, and b) the same thing (teasing her about that night) had happened countless times, even with other people in the group. 

AITA here?

edit: I should clarify, because judging from the first few comments I don't think people got something.

**I didn't share her story**. I just made a pun, a reference to it. My joke indicated some promiscuity, but I didn't single Gina out. I made the joke and everyone laughed and instinctively looked at her. 

It's just that my joke had such a good reaction that the people who didn't get it wanted to know more, and they kinda figured out it had to do with Gina since everyone was looking at her.",AITA for a kind of slut shaming joke I made?
752,AmItheAsshole,"I’ve always wondered if I was the asshole in this situation. We (me, husband, 2 kids) live about 2.5 hours from my MIL. She drives up to visit about 5-6 times a year. I learned a long time ago never to ask when she’s leaving to go back home. This is considered by her to be very rude. Even my husband won’t ask her. It’s just an unknown that we have to work our schedules around. 
Fast forward to a few years ago we moved 12 hours away. Now she’ll be flying to visit. These open-ended visits were NOT going to work for me anymore. I decided to be clear and up front with my expectations on how long the visit should last. I emailed her to invite her for 4 nights, and which day to actually show up. My email was ignored. She booked her flight to arrive two days before the day I told her and planned to stay for 7 nights. Once I discovered this I asked her to change her flight. She ignored that email as well. 
Basically I could go on and on but what happened was she got mad about something and stayed at a hotel for the last night and we didn’t see her for the rest of the time we lived there (2 years) which was pretty awesome. I feel I should tell you that her visits are not pleasant, and the longer they last the likelihood of my husband screaming at her increase exponentially.

When my boyfriend came home last night I told him the news and he got very upset that I didn't even think to invite him, which is not true. I thought of him immediately and figured he wouldn't want to spend $1000 plus dollars seeing an artist he has never seen before. He countered by telling me he has always wanted to see this artist with me, which was news to me.

754,AmItheAsshole,"I'm a SAHM of a 1 1/2 yo and I am very, very pregnant. My due date is in about 2 weeks, but I could ""go"" any day now.

My midwives have told me time and time again that I really need to take it easy because of some medical conditions that have arisen during this pregnancy. And while I would love to just lounge around all day, that's not exactly realistic with a toddler and when the house only runs if I do my job. However, I have stepped back as much as I can.

After my husband noticed the pain and discomfort that I've been in, he has really stepped up around the house and with our son. This post is not to shame him, really. He took over our son's entire nighttime routine (minus 2 days a week because he has night school) and has helped me with some of my chores here and there. 

But, here's the thing. Sometimes, when I feel like I have the energy, I will try to clean the dishes and the kitchen because having a dirty kitchen stresses me out a lot. I cook almost everything from scratch and therefore use a lot of dishes, so it's annoying when I need something and it isnt clean. But my husband will see me try to do this and he will tell me to go sit down and that he will do the dishes for me, ""later"". It's always ""later"". I'll stress about it being dirty all day, while he plays video games, until he finally decides to clean it, but when he does, he never cleans all of the dishes. He will clean most, usually, but will always leave some small stuff in the right side of the sink. Or he will forget to check around the kitchen for forgotten dishes (i.e. pots and pans on the stove). So, basically, when he says he will do what needs done, he never does it in full.

Ive tried telling him that it's not helpful when he does this, because it just causes me to be more stressed than if I were to just do the dishes myself, and he has apologized but he keeps doing it. I feel bad complaining because he *is* helping.. but it's not very helpful to me, imo. 

It happened again recently and I tried to explain that his ""help"" isn't exactly ""helpful"" and he said that I shouldn't even be worried about having a clean kitchen.",AITA For telling my husband that his way of helping me with my chores isn't all that helpful?
755,AmItheAsshole,"My mom (46F) has been dating a man (in his 50's we'll call him Tom), who is going through a divorce at the moment. My mom has been divorced since '94. 

They met in May 2019 (about a week after my son was born). They break up and get back together so often (2 days ago they got back together for the 4th time). The reasoning being that ""he needs time alone to do things he wants"". She obsesses over him and asks me to ""send positive vibes and pray they get back together"", which admittedly makes me avoid talking to her when theyve broken up. 

Tom isn't a bad person he buys her nice things, cooks dinner for her and my sister (24F) often and even bought my mom a new TV when hers broke. 
The one time I met him, I felt so uncomfortable around him. Not like creepiness, but something about him just bothered me. I'm nice to him, and talk to him when my mom sticks him on the phone, but I try to avoid it. 
They've agreed that neither wants to get married, just date permanently. (But that's only when hes not ""scared"" of how he feels for her)

My mom always calls him ""Grandpa Tom"" (which pisses me off). Constantly talks about him ""he made this for dinner and its soooooo good!"", ""you wont believe what Tom said last night, it was so funny!"" I always end up rolling my eyes and bringing up a new subject. 

Now to the actual AITA-

I have a son who will be turning 1 year old in May. I moved 1300 miles in September away from my mom and sister. My mom wants to drive out for his birthday, but my sister doesn't think she will be able to get the time off of work, so my mom suggested she bring Tom. 

I immediately said no. I don't know him enough to be comfortable with this, plus we're already doing 2 parties with my boyfriends family (long story). She got mad, said she wouldn't come and hung up on me. I understand why she wants him to come, and it'd be different if they were married because then I'd feel more obligation to have him come, but they're not. 

I'm also getting married in fall of 2021, and my mom says she's excited for them to drive out here for it. (I REALLY don't want him there), and she even suggested they both walk me down the aisle. (I'm walking myself) I haven't told her yet I dont want him there, I already have an inkling of how that will go. 

I dont hate Tom, he makes her happy (until he's not). My sister used to like him (until the 3rd break up) and now just tolerates him. I understand my mom wants to be with him, and I accept that and am so happy for her, but I don't want him as an active participant in my life.

756,AmItheAsshole,"Me and my boyfriend had a fight tonight. 

Context: I am currently suffering a minor back injury, meaning I struggle to walk or stand at the moment.  I've had to leave uni temporarily to come and live at my boyfriends, as I can't currently do much for myself. I am also on a keto diet (random but relevant). I had offered to come off the diet while at his to make cooking easier for us but he insisted I keep at it. 

So my boyfriend gets home from work, I'd managed to hobble myself into the kitchen and cook some food for him, but due to my diet I couldn't eat it myself, and there weren't many other options for me. I asked him to take me to the shops so I could buy some food that I could eat. 

He immediately becomes annoyed at me, complaining that he's just finished work and he's got more stuff to do, and that it's a waste of time to take me. I sat okay I'll see what I can do what what's in the fridge. Only thing I can eat is eggs. I had eaten eggs for the past four meals. Didn't fancy more eggs. He reluctantly takes me, but all the way there is ranting about how it's a waste of his time and he's doing me a huge favor which I'm ungrateful for. I made several attempts to lighten the mood, all which got shut down.  By the time we get to the shops I'm crying (I'll admit that it is my time of the month and I might have overreacted by crying, but you know how it gets ladies), people are looking at me wondering if I've been kidnapped, as I'm walking about all limpy and crying, it was very embarrassing (for the both of us I'm sure). 

When we get home I have to stand in the kitchen in pain to cook my food and put the shopping away (I only bought enough for dinner today and lunch tomorrow so more eggs for me) while he goes upstairs in a strop. 

I ask him if he will just apologise, he says no. He says I'm the one in the wrong, that I'm ungrateful, that I am a poor communicator (for not letting him know sooner I'd need food), and that I'm blowing things out of proportion (I'll give him that one I suppose). He says I should just drop it. 

I said I will when I get an apology. 

No sign of that and now it's nearly time for him to sleep on the sofa. (Edit: I'm JOKING)

757,AmItheAsshole,"So I went into business a while back as a small time contractor. As you might imagine, I needed quite a bit of money to get things off the ground and I racked up a fair amount of debt, which I have slowly been paying off. In the summer (my busy season) I make large payments, and in the winter (slow season) I cover the payment, plus interest. Keep the balance from rising while work is slow and then take chunks off it when the money starts rolling again. Simple stuff right?

Well last year things really started to pick up steam so I decided I needed some help handling the administration side of things as well as hiring a second crew. I do a lot of the labor myself, estimates, blue prints, customer service, all that jazz. It's a lot to keep up with. I asked my mom if she would be willing to help with the administration end, (competitive wages of course) as she has experience with accounting. I know, I know, mixing family and business never ends well. My bad.

So obviously it's now the slow season and I revert to my ""pay what I need to pay"" philosophy. Well I go to look at my account earlier this morning and noticed that ***THOUSANDS*** of dollars are missing. I start looking at the statements and noticed that there have been enormous payments made on both my business debt and outrageous amounts spent on advertising (it's the slow season. Even if I get calls, I can't do the work until the spring regardless. Unless its indoor work, which is very rare...what the hell kinda good does advertising do me right now?)

NOW... I am willing to take some responsibility in this, as I should have been monitoring the account more closely.  I'm the owner after all. But these are SUPER simple concepts here. I can't wrap my head around how these decisions made ANY sense at all. I could have explained my process in greater detail, yes. But for Christs sake this is supposed to be ""your thing"".

This is all very fresh as I came to this realization only a few hours ago. I haven't even addressed it with my mother yet.

He asked me what we were and I said we clearly both had feelings for each other but you can go off and fuck whoever and I can do the same while you’re at work. He then left and went to work 15 hours away and we continued talking, FaceTiming, etc. After 5 months, he began seeing other people for sexual activities. However, after each encounter he would tell me shit like “baby! Guess what I did last night?” “What?” “I had really rough sex” or “she had beautiful eyes” or “my heart hurts because she left.” I dont care that he is fucking other people, I care that he is making emotional connections with them. Whenever he says these things, I become short with him. He then thinks I’m mad but I’m really just sad, then I apologize for being sad and say that he can do whatever he wants.

One of the spares has a single bed which my brother took and I decided to take the single from the other spare and put it in our master bedroom to sleep on whilst my mother takes the larger double bed. She’s 73 but is very frail, has dementia amongst various other illnesses. She’s also had 2 falls in the last month or so, one which required stitches.

763,AmItheAsshole,"A bit ago, I moved into a house with two dudes and a girl. We'll call them Wanda, Jake, and Toby. They were friends from before so moving in when the space opened up and my lease expiring on my old place seemed like a no-brainer. I had some problems financially and couldn't get on the lease right away, so we worked it out where I could put money away for the deposit within a month and apply then.

Wanda announced they were moving out about that month later, and a week after that, the day I went to fill out the paperwork, the other two decided the same thing. They all put in their 30-day at the same time and left me pretty fucked.

We had a house meeting about it, all 3 promised to try to help me find a new place and then help me move in, though over the next two weeks Toby was really the only one that tried, showing me a couple places he thought would work out.

I ended up finding a place on my own and that's when Wanda ghosted the place. Texted her asking if she'd be available, and silence. Never talked to her again after that.

Jake and Toby said not to worry, they'd be around to help me move, they needed to stay so that the house could be cleaned anyway, and I agreed to clean Wanda's room since she didn't, along with an equal part of the rest of the house. I kept them in the know about my move and they were solidly behind me until...

the day of my move comes, and the boys are gone. One went on a date, and the other just left. Both were totally unreachable. I called a co-worker I had as a backup plan (a co-worker I was staying with for that week, because there were a few days where my time in one house ended and I didn't have anywhere to go for a couple days while the landlords prepped the rest of the new place) and we got all my stuff in the new place after about an hour, and the guys were still gone when I was done.

I decided to tell the group I was going, and that due to everyone just ghosting me after they agreed to help that I was going to be similarly ""unavailable"" to clean the apartment.

This ended in a text fight over whether or not I'd get my deposit back between Toby, Jake and I (I did pay that in the time agreed). I explained myself and they were still mad. I ended up getting my deposit back from Toby, who apologized for the whole mess, and I thought that would be that.

Well, I still hang out with one of Jake's friends frequently and there may come some future gathering where I might have to face Jake again, and I want to know if my actions were justified or if I should head off any tension with an apology.

764,AmItheAsshole,"I know how the title makes it sound. Throwaway because reasons. Sorry if it's jumbled. I'm on mobile. 

First off: they're already married. They got married in December after getting engaged in late September. Because my husband and I live across the country from her, she said she didn't expect us to be able to afford to attend the December wedding. Which is great, because we couldn't without advanced notice.

The second wedding (renewal of vows?) is set to occur in June. The plan was that the 'wedding' and reception would occur on their property. They've been working on building a house/apartment/garage since this past June and living with my mother in her home. It was supposed to be completed by December. That didn't happen. They haven't even broken ground on a home yet.  

Last Friday, she sends a group text consisting of myself, my mother, and my cousin (her MOH) ""Long story short, there will be no wedding in June. So no need to plan vacation or get plane tickets.""  This was handy info since I had planned to order my bridesmaids dress that weekend because they can take FOREVER to come in. Plus we had planned on getting plane tickets soon because they're cheaper now than they would be closer to the date. 

After ignoring my questions and telling me to ask our mother for details, I finally found out that it was because the house (i.e. venue) would not be ready by June. My sister wouldn't talk about a backup plan at all. 

Today, I was chatting with my mother on my way home from work when she casually mentioned that my sister may have found a builder who says he can have the house done by June and that the wedding MIGHT be 'back on."" I am... skeptical because this seems like the same runaround she was getting before. 

I want her to wait to set the date until after the house is complete for a couple of reasons. 

1. I can only afford to fly out to visit them once this year. We're already planning on visiting my in-laws in July (also across the country).  I don't want to ""waste my visit"" and then miss anything. Cancelling flights is a nightmare. 

2. I fluctuate in size, so I'd really like to order a bridesmaids dress only a few months in advance in case I gain/lose weight.  I called David's bridal and they said that if I ordered a dress TODAY that it potentially wouldn't be in until April/May. That does not leave a lot of wiggle room for potential alterations. 

I texted her after thinking about it more and said that if the wedding was back on, she needed to let us know ASAP for the aforementioned reasons.  I'm also a little annoyed that she is ""yo-yo-ing"" us around with this. I'd love everyone's thoughts.

Here's a little backstory before I (22F) get into this. 

I used to be friends with this one girl in my old highschool. We got along quite well &amp; we had fun for that whole year &amp; a half. 

Sadly, I felt like her sister &amp; mother never liked me. 

One day, when me &amp; my friend were outside in the school commons, permission granted by the teacher, her sister saw us both &amp; she immediately given me a dirty look &amp; begin to integrate us on why we weren't in class, saying to me that I shouldn't teach her sister to cut class. I told her nicely that we gotten permission from our teacher, she didn't believe me. She soon left with giving me one last look of disapproval as she told her sister (my friend) to get back to class or she'll tell their mother. 

Later on that month, I went to my brothers graduation. Her sister was graduating as well &amp; she (my friend) asked if I wanted to sit with her &amp; her mother. I agreed &amp; I felt really nervous being around her mother. My friend is a very shy &amp; quiet person. When I sat &amp; spoke to her mother, I could tell she was the quiet type. When her sister got called, I cheered for her to be nice, even though she was a bit rude to me. Her mother gave me a look &amp; I noticed neither of them cheered, only clapped. I felt embarrassed. I wasn't angry or anything, just embarrassed. 

Now, to the present time. 

I was out &amp; went to a gas station to pump up some gas. I went inside the shop &amp; I didn't see her at first until I stood in line. Her &amp; her family were there. I was happy to know that she was doing okay, but I couldn't bear to say hello to her. She looked at me, she saw me, but she didn't approach me. But, she did look like she wanted to say hi to me. 

I became extremely anxious because both her mother &amp; her sister were there next to her. I felt like I wouldve been a bother or not up to their standards like last time. I pulled out my cellphone &amp; pretended I didn't see her.

766,AmItheAsshole,"**Context:** I live with my grandfather and he has consistently failed to keep up with his promises. He is a smoker and over the recent years has started smoking inside the house. I moved in mid 2019. My aunt and I have struggled dealing with him as he is set in his ways and gets angry easily. He wants people to do things on his time, doesn't trust people to do things right, and ignores doctor's instructions. I have asthma and he frequently smokes in the basement and have asked to try and work with him on this issue. Here are all our conversations

**Convo 1**

Me: Hey is it possible for you to smoke on the other side of the basement? I usually sit in the living room which is above where you sit and smoke.

Grandfather: Sure.

Result: He didn't do it

**Convo 2**

Me: The smoke is really messing up with my breathing. Could you possibly smoke out side?

Grandfather: Sure.

Result: He didn't do it

**Convo 3**

Me: I wanted to ask if it is possible if we could replace the small basement block windows with sliding ones so you can have ventilation. Alternatively could you smoke in the attic which has a window that can open?

Grandfather: No, I'll just go outside.

Result: He didn't do it

**Convo 4**

Me: I write a note thinking maybe my voice is better expressed that way I touch on 2nd hand smoke and how it affects me including my asthma.

Grandfather: I'll just smoke outside

Result: He didn't do it

**Convo 5**

Me: You just had surgery and the doctor says you cannot go in the basement due to no railing and you said you would smoke outside.

Grandfather: I'll do what I want

**Outcome:** So I decide to get my point across that every day he smokes in the basement I will not do him 1 favor the next day. I'll do the 2nd and all after. Today he asked if I could the dishes in the morning and I told him no because he doesn't respect me. Now he and my dad are calling me TA. He will probably threaten kicking me out if I do it again.",AITA For not washing the dishes?
767,AmItheAsshole,"I didn’t feel like an asshole at first, but this girl is literally sitting on the train glaring daggers at me right now so I’m doubting my life choices. 

Okay so story time. I live in NJ and work in NYC. For now, my commute is about 2 hours per day total and as I’m a hotel manager, I’m scheduled to work overnight two times per week. Last night I worked a 12 hour overnight shift on my 7th day straight without time off. Pretty standard in my career path, but draining. The point of this is to explain that I’m tired and fucking grumpy, and I want to sleep. 

So I get on the train this morning and immediately search out one of the two quiet cars. These cars have signs that say that no cell phone use is allowed, and all conversation must be kept at a minimum. The conductors usually enforce this pretty well. I sit down, show the conductor my ticket and pass the hell out. 

About five stops into my trip I’m woken up by this woman sitting across from me speaking loudly in Spanish. Like practically yelling into the phone. The people in the next car could’ve heard the woman. I ask her politely to move to another car for her conversation as this is a quiet car, and she ignores me completely and continues her conversation. When she hung up the phone she glared at me pretty hard but I honestly don’t give a fuck. There was a sign right next to her. These cars are clearly marked. 

This is where I MIGHT be an asshole. A few minutes later another girl gets on the train and sits in the quiet car right near me. She’s talking on her phone but doing so quietly and I can barely hear her so I leave it alone. The longer she’s on the train though, the louder she gets and she starts laughing. I still couldn’t hear her conversation, only mumbling and laughing but at this point I’m annoyed, I’m awake when I don’t want to be, and another person is sitting in one of TWO cars where talking isn’t permitted and is talking. 

So I pointed to the quiet car sign. The girl looked confused so I said “This is a quiet car”. She shrugged and replied, “That’s okay” and didn’t move. After a couple of minutes she did get off the phone but she’s been glaring at me since like I’m some kind of massive bitch. I was already awake so I probably could’ve just let it be, but she could’ve sat in literally any other car on the damn train. 

I have about 20 minutes left in my commute and I’m wide awake now so I have to ask, AITA?",AITA for pointing out that we are sitting in a quiet car?
768,AmItheAsshole,"I (17F) am a relatively new driver. I hate driving—ESPECIALLY with my mom in the car. Since I had never pumped gas before, I asked my mom if she could come with me and help me. We got to the gas station, but I was having trouble getting parallel to one of the station thingies. My mom was trying to explain that I had to get parallel, but I knew that and just couldn’t visualize which way to turn. I had to think about it a lot. My mom grew increasingly impatient and kept trying to tell me in her words how to do it, but I just didn’t understand it. I’m really bad at visualizing things and it takes me a few tries to understand it. I had never tried this sort of maneuver before, so it’s understandable that I couldn’t get it on the first try. Eventually, she got so annoyed that she just took the wheel and did it herself.

When I asked her how to pump the gas, she scoffed at me and said I should have taken the initiative and looked it up so I wouldn’t have to ask her. I didn’t get that because the point of her going with me to the gas station was literally for her to teach me how to pump gas. When we got home, my mom remarked disparagingly I would have definitely failed Driver’s Ed and that I was stupid for not knowing how to get parallel to the gas station thing and basically went on a rant about how I was a failure at driving. I got really upset but I tried not to let her know that I was upset by those comments. After that, I proceeded to go to my room and cry. Right as we speak, she’s badmouthing my driving skills to my dad.

Reasons like this are why I hate driving so much.  I was forced to learn how to drive in the first place and never really wanted to, but I knew it was necessary. But at this point, I’m just upset that my mom knows how much I dislike driving and still acts this way even though it discourages me from wanting to drive even more.

769,AmItheAsshole,"I am the asshole of this story.  
Sorry beforehand, English is not my native language and I needed to translate some parts.

The actor: Me (me) and my Mother (M)

It was around Christmas and I was sitting in the kitchen of my parents home with my mother (I am living in an other country). After talking for some time, my mother wanted to talk about her future.

For your information, my father is 2 years older then my mother, but had a heart issue (way better after an operation). I am still worried about him. My mother cannot survive without my father on an emotional level. There are together for more then 40 years. She really loves him, but after him almost dying last year, that makes her thinking about her future. So out of the blue this conversation started

M: If your father dies before me, I will move closer to you and you will see me more often. (Really my mother does not want my father to die, but she is thinking about it after last year)

Me: Okay... But what if I leave to an other city to get a job there.

M looked at me confused with a ""Why would you leave a place"" look.

Me: I work at a changing job and I may need to work somewhere else.

M: We will see, how that works for me.

A little bit of more background about me and my family:

I am 30, single and working in a good Job in middle Europe. I have two older brothers with wives and kids (16+), that live close to my mother. I am living in an other country. All my mothers friends and family is around her place, but she wants to move close to me, where I am here only connection. I told her, that I am alone and I will not have any kind of help to supporting her.

M: That will work for me. I do not want to stay with your brothers and sister in laws.

My mother expect me to give most of my freedom from my life, because she wants to live close to me. No more job changes. No more place changes.  
The worst thing for me: You did not asked me. She demanded it. She demanded, that I will give up everything, because she wants to be near me.

I am the asshole of this story.  
It is my mother and I love her. She wants to be near me, because she loves me.

770,AmItheAsshole,"I have an old friend, Kevin, who spent 2 years studying abroad. While he was away, I dated this girl, Maria, for about 3 months. It didn't end too well, I caught her talking to her ex and I ended things on the spot. In all fairness to her, I'm extremely sensitive to even the slightest betrayal of trust in a relationship, so don't think she's a cheater or anything. She was a decent person and probably just struggling to get over her ex. 

Anyway, Kevin returned home a year ago and, as luck would have it, he began dating Maria back in December, obviously unaware of our connection. Maria messaged me last week to tell me that she hadn't told Kevin anything about us and that she preferred if he didn't know just yet. So she practically asked me to lie to him and also ask our two other friends who had met her as *my* girlfriend before to cover for us and not let anything slip out. I told her I'd think about it.

I haven't said anything to anyone yet, but I'm leaning towards telling Kevin. Everything, even the fact that she asked me not to tell. I won't pretend Kevin is like a brother to me, but I still see no reason to lie to him. Especially for a girl that I don't particularly like nor trust that she'll ever tell him in the future.

Original:::
I'm on maternity leave. My husband works 4 10's. After work today I told him to feed the baby and distract him if he gets fussy so that I could have a chance to go through my clothes. I'm returning to work soon and I still have some baby weight so I need to see if anything fits. I can technically do this while my husband is at work but the kiddo was really fussy and I was working through a new recipe so I didnt have the time.

Later on in the evening my husband made a comment about how he didnt get to rest after work and how I didnt even thank him for helping me out tonight. I got upset and said that spending time with his child is not a favor he's doing for me, it's just being a parent. He said that on the days he is working, the kiddo should be my responsibility since I'm on maternity leave and I have time to rest during the day.

I put in way more than 40 hours a week taking care of the baby and I even sleep in a separate room so the nightly feedings dont wake my husband up. I just get so sick of being ""on-call"" all the time. Sometimes I just want to focus on a task for a few hours without having to drop everything to feed or play with the baby...

777,AmItheAsshole,"I (22M) have a sister (24F). We have a pretty good relationship. She came over to my place last night and we cooked dinner together. We have done that quite often since I moved close to her. One thing I don’t like about her is her constant bitching about inconsequential matters. I have always just listened to her bitching because I know she just needs an ear, but today I had enough. While we were cooking, she bitched about the following things. Most of them are recurring complaints. She said her hair is so damaged because she has to get her hair bleached and dyed all the time since she’s a model and doesn’t get to have much control over her style. She even had the gall to bitch about her boobs killing her back even though she’s the one who wanted implants. She also bitched about the traffic on the way here. It’s LA. Traffic is a given. My breaking point was when she bitched about her boyfriend not returning her calls.


I told her she has it easy and she really needs to stop bitching and bringing everyone else around her down. She asked me why she had it easy. I told her she lucked out being born a pretty girl and never having to do anything besides posing in front of cameras and being lucky enough to snag a rich boyfriend who she can live off and never have to work again after she gets married to him. I told her she doesn’t hear me bitching even though I work a soul-sucking office job with ugly female coworkers for 60 hours a week to make pennies.


She asked me if I think it’s easy for her because she’s a woman. I told her many women have it tough, but she has it easy because she was dealt the right cards and she should really be grateful instead of complaining all the time. She said her life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows and she has to face nonstop harassment and her relationships are often skin-deep because no one can see past her outer appearance. I said she must be joking because 99% of people would trade lives with her in a heartbeat if these little things are worth complaining about. She said everyone has a right to bitch about things to relieve tension and I can bitch to her about my life to her as well. I said it’s not necessary and she should really cool it with the bitching because it makes her look like a child and kills the mood. 


She said she’ll try to bitch less, but said again she doesn’t have it easy and her life is every bit as hard as mine.

This event had been planned by my friend and his two roommates for nearly a semester, and the invite was nearly 30 people in a relatively small college apartment. I didn't know a lot of the people at the party, but a good chunk of them were people I knew from a student org I participate in. However, my two roommates (and very good friends) who are a part of that student org were not invited to this event.

Since there were already a large number of people attending the party, I did not feel comfortable asking if the two of them (and likely my roommate's girlfriend as well) could come, especially since in the invite they specifically asked that we limit our Plus Ones and get them approved in advance. 

My roommates/friends, obviously, found out about the party and are upset that I did not attempt to bring them along to this event where a lot of our shared friends were. When asked about it I kind of failed to explain it away as ""there's going to be too many people there"" which only made them feel worse.

So last year when I saw a Broadway musical was coming to town on our anniversary weekend, I snagged up some really good seats and paid about $200 for them thinking it would be a cool experience that neither of us have never really done before and also sort of count as a present for us both.   I did all the legwork and made some reservations at a nice restaurant, got the parents to agree to come to town to watch the kids, and even took off work that day since it was my weekend to work.

781,AmItheAsshole,"My mom and dad divorced back in the 1980s, and my older sister (two years older) and I grew up living with my mom. She depended on us, and we depended on her. My mom was a good parent. She gave us the room to grow and be ourselves. She's a good person but is fading and failing as she reaches old age.

My sister graduated from a local university and then moved out of state to the east coast. She was pursuing a couple of ideas--one, to work in theater, and the other, to work in publishing. The latter worked out to at least some extent. I went to college in-state, too, and then I went to graduate school in our the same city where we grew up and where my mom still lives. Although I might have liked to move out of this city, I've stayed for a couple of reasons. For one, it's not a bad place to be. It's pretty cosmopolitan--there's a ton of diversity--and it provides pretty much the stuff you'd hope a major city would provide. It's also given me economic freedom and opportunity, which is no bad thing. Finally, it also let me be there for my mom, and I knew she would need me at some point.

That time has come, unfortunately. My mom is failing. Her memory is poor, and the results of some bad life decisions she made in past have come to impact her health. My mom was also--I have subsequently found--terrible with money. Money can fix a lot of problems in that it can pay for caregivers and people to deal with all the things you can no longer do yourself. But my mother doesn't have the resources to fix many of the problems that have either come about naturally or that she created. That leaves it to the kids. And here's where the question comes up. I called my sister--now living ""up east""--and told her my mom's difficulties. We've discussed it for years, and things are just now hitting a crisis point. My sister was working but lost her job last July. Since then, she has worked par-time. It's honest work but far from her professional job. I suggested to my sister she could come ""back home"" to help with my mom and got a waffling version of a flat refusal. She gave me excuse after excuse as to why it just wouldn't work.

There's some truth to what my sister said. She hasn't driven a car in 30+ years, and I live in a city where passenger cars are the rule, so I get that. She said she had a job where she is, but the same company is here. It sounds like excuse-making to me. So, I'm pretty convinced that my sister is an asshole, no matter what.

784,AmItheAsshole,"tw: death mention, drug abuse

my (i’m 20F) grandmother is a drug addict, and has been for my whole life, and the majority of my mother’s. She’s been married to my grandfather for about 25 years. 

3 years ago, long story short, I found her drug dealer/fellow junkie dead in her house after vacation (he was watching the house/dogs). She’s got untreated bipolar and is narcissistic. She was emotionally/mentally abusive to my mom &amp; aunt growing up. She completely ignored the fact that I experienced a traumatic event that was arguably her fault to some extent (she got him re-addicted after he had been clean from rehab), texting me afterwards something like “we lost a beautiful soul and we’ll all miss him.” He was an awful, creepy person.

My family protected me from what she really was like and what she was doing growing up, but decided I was old enough to know when I was around 16. For 2 years I was learning about how awful of a person she really was, she was becoming more open about her dislike of my younger sister (13 at the time of the incident, she would call her a brat and blame her for things) and so this was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I stopped talking to her, and I stopped going to her house where I found the dude. Everyone else in my family is 100% behind me, except my grandfather. He very devoutly Catholic, and pretty much believes that I should basically ignore that it happened? Like he was furious about what happened, but he also thinks that I should still talk to my grandmother because she’s well, my grandmother and she “still loves you very much”. He basically wants me to forgive her/get over it because she’s family.

I was fine with seeing him since he hasn’t done anything to me, and he’s still friendly with others in my family. On a visit with cousins 2 weeks ago, he refused to see me because I said I didn’t want to see my gran. 

He reminded me when he was still seeing me (until the event with my cousins) that she misses me and loves me and that we should do something. He was trying to get me to go over to the house, but I refused. He paid for my computer in high school and my laptop for college, and I’m currently still on his phone plan. He also helps my paternal grandmother with a lot of things around the house after my paternal grandfather died because he’s an ex-engineer. 

The same year of the incident, I was a debutante and only invited him and he came but still brought my gran, and then when my paternal grandfather died they both showed up to the funeral despite not being officially informed (i still dont know how they found out about the service). 

tldr; am i the asshole for cutting off my grandmother after she was responsible for a traumatic event, and being upset with my grandfather for cutting /me/ off in return? i’m losing my relationship with my grandfather over a situation with my grandmother.",AITA for cutting off my grandparents?
785,AmItheAsshole,"So first of all I'm obviously using a throwaway sing my girlfriend knows my actual account.

So I am a college student(M) who is dating a girl that I met over the internet through gaming, she lives on a different continent. We have been together for about 6 months now. Notably I am the sort of guy who just makes friends with girls in real life, and she makes friends with a lot of guys over the internet. We have talked to each other about jealousy issues in the past and have sort of agreed on just trying to deal with our jealousy ourselves.

This sort of becomes an issue because I get dinner with one of my female friends about once a week. It is just a thing we do because we don't see each other often as we don't have classes together and are busy college students.(I have been friends with this person for about a year longer than I have known my girlfriend.) My girlfriend has told me in the past that getting dinner with this friend is not considered ""normal"" and I can see her point of view, but from my perspective it sort of is normal. And if I stopped I would basically never see this friend.

Now this shouldn't be a huge issue, except that my girlfriend deals with multiple mental health problems, including but not limited to depression and paranoia. So when I tell her that I'm hanging out with this or any friend, she first becomes paranoid that something might happen(she knows that its ridiculous, but paranoia apparently doesn't care and makes her think illogically). This paranoia then feeds into her depression, so when I'm trying to have a relaxing time with my friend, I am instead receiving multiple texts from my girlfriend about how she wants to end it all and I have to tell her to not do that and that everything will be fine. Honestly I'm a bit weary of it, from trying to make it look like everything is fine to my friend even though I am severely worried.

A few days ago I got food with this friend after classes and just didn't tell my girlfriend, primarily because she was still asleep. I'm sorta ashamed to say I was glad to get some peace when trying to hang out with a friend.

So now I'm wondering if I just shouldn't tell my girlfriend when I hang out with my friends. I know that it makes me look like a bad boyfriend, or someone who has something to hide by not telling her, but sometimes I just need a break. It's also not like she always thinks something will happen between me and one of my friends, she knows I only want her, but her paranoia says otherwise. I am also aware that if she finds out I haven't been telling her everything, her paranoia will probably get worse than if I just tell her when I'm going to hang out with these friends every time I do. I'm stuck and need outside opinions.

TLDR: It's a mess.

I will probably be monitoring this post with my main account on my phone as my laptop is about to die. So I likely will not be replying to anything in the comments.

Also if my girlfriend sees this post it is way too specific to be anyone else so I will be screwed.

Edit: looking at the comments, it is a pretty good, mix, but the majority is fairly clear that I would be the asshole if I don't communicate things. Also wanted to clarify that I in no way intend to stop hanging out with my friends because of my girlfriend, and she is aware of that fact.",WIBTA if I stop telling my girlfriend when I hang out with my other friends who are also girls?
786,AmItheAsshole,"So I am a freshmen in highschool, my grades are not currently high enough to get a job. My brother has been teaching me how to cook stuff such as chicken, steak, pork, and potatoes fries and wedges.  My brother is 20(m) and I am 14(m). My friend always complained about being hungry so I said I would make him some potato wedges, I let a few friends try it, it was the normal salt and stuff. I was telling other friend about it and she tried some and told me I should sell it. I need money because I don't get allowance or anything and I can't work, so of course I made a whole plan. 

I started asking around to friends if they wanted some, and lots of them were not able to pay so I offered it for free, I only ended up getting about $3 and my friend gave me a quarter just to get 2 wedges. I used a seasoning my brother showed me and I really liked it, only about 3 people got it about of 8, the rest asked for salt or a custom seasoning( sugar and cinnamon, and hot sauce) and the people who paid didn't get the seasoning my brother showed me.

I was excited I was getting money because ( I know this is really cringy for having/doing but it is honestly out of shits and giggles.) I was planning on getting a actual like dog tag with my name engraved because I wear a dog collar. I am about half way there and I am trying my best to get the money for it. 

My brother was commenting on the fact I didn't do the dishes and I told him I forgot and he said ""what were you doing then? You were up so early making potatos."" And i said "" yeah, what about it? I forgot to do the dishes, I'll do them tonight"" and he just ignored it. I then later told him about how the people who tried the fries really liked them and some are paying for it. He got all mad and went off.
B: You are using MY recipe and selling it!
Me: Yeah, but it's not just yours, only 3 people ordered it.
B: Yeah but I thought you and showed you and you are selling food after I showed you how!
Me: What do you think cooking classes are?
B: Okay, I taught you for FREE and you are selling it!
Me: Okay yeah but you are my brother and no one else did. Chiefs get taught by their parents and use their recipes.
B: Yeah but I'm not your parent. I want a part of it.
Me: then how much? I only got $3.
B: I want some if it.

He then went into his room. I would like to make money but it's not like I'm ONLY selling the stuff with his seasoning. And i never told people I made the seasoning, I said I made the fries and wedges by hand and I cook them and season them. Should I play him?

Situation: Ever since then my parents have been wary of everything that came from the sea. Theyve made an exception to one kind of very basic fish bought from the supermarket, but anything else is off limits.

Thing is, I love fish, I think its better than actual red meat. But my mom is extremely wary of it because ""youre allergic to it"" even though I've explained the difference a thousand times. 

Recently  I went to a restaurant with my family,  and I ordered fish, they both looked at me and I just had it, I looked to the waitress and told them ""Is this seafood? Because I'm allergic to it.""And they of course assured me that is in fact fish and not seafood. I knew that by telling the restaurant staff of my allergy that I was covered from actually getting s reaction (hopefully) and I sure as hell trust restaurants more than the supermarket clerk, but oh well my parents aparently have it skewed the other way around and berated me for taking that choice and that ""You always make such a big fuzz about fish and not listen to us, when we say NO its NO.""

My colleagues and I decided to go to this chinese place for lunch. At the end of the meal, we were waiting for our company car to pick us up (there were 5 of us), and in the mean time, I thought I'd nip out and have a smoke.

I came back and sat down next to the asthmatic colleague, and she immediately said ""SmokeThatUp, you need to sit somewhere else while we're waiting. You stink of smoke and I can't breathe because of my asthma"".

This was already more confrontation than I need all year, so I kind of awkwardly laughed it off and sat further away from her.

806,AmItheAsshole,"So here is the situation- my young sons father is getting married out of town- about 5 hours away - and his dad has heavily implied he'd like me to take him and bring him back home as it would be easier on his own parents to not have to drive him all the way back home post wedding ( because he will be immediately leaving for his honeymoon so he can't bring him back). I've told him I won't be able to make that trip as its extremely inconvenient for me and while he hasn't explicitly said ""I want you to do this"" it seems implied as he's been very snappy with me saying that there has to be an easier way than his parents being the transportation.  He has implied several times that I'm just making this harder on everyone. He's also made comments about hoping that our son will be on his best behavior since he is in the wedding so I am assuming he also wants me there to help make sure my son is well behaved  which also rubbed me the wrong way. I don't want to budge on this... . so am I just being a stubborn asshole?

EDIT: INFO   
I did tell them months ago that this would be hard for me to accommodate and have asked about it several times since and still no concrete answer. I have also suggested our son just stay with my ex's parents longer but that's not an option either.

807,AmItheAsshole,"Tonight, my parents (60m &amp; 57f) invited me (28f) to a movie. We carpooled with my dad driving. A couple minutes in, I ask if he could turn his audiobook down. I was sitting right near the speaker and it was really hurting my ears. He turns it down 1 notch, which doesn't make a difference. I ask again if he could please turn it down a little.

He blew up. He said that I need to learn how to respect other people's property. I said I was just making a normal request. If someone was in my car and asked me to turn my music down, I would. He said that's not the way the world works and that I need to f-ing grow up. He said when someone invites you to ride in their car you respect their rules. I get this as a concept, but I think the volume is a common courtesy thing. He told me to ""f-ing hush.""

At this point, I was like, great, this is what I'm in for tonight. I ask if he could take me back home. He says no. So I was like okay, well could you drop me at the gas station right there so I can just get a Lyft? He tells me I need to learn how to face conflict head on and talk it through.

I'm really frustrated now. I point out that he told me to f-ing hush, which is not conducive to ""talking it through."" He continues to tell me how I always ""run away like a little child"" and I've done this since I was 16 years old.

My mom keeps saying things like, ""y'all please"" and ""don't do this"" and is almost crying. My dad gets pissed at me for ""making her cry""  and ""ruining the evening."" He turns his audiobook back up  and makes a big show of fading it to the front.

We arrive at the movies. I say hey, y'all go on in and enjoy but I'm gonna get a Lyft and head home. My dad again accuses me of acting like a child. I say no, I'm just trying to leave an uncomfortable and disrespectful situation.

My mom asks if we can both apologize. My dad apologizes in a sarcastic way, including a bow/curtsy move. I say I have nothing to apologize for. I repeat that I'm just trying to remove myself from a disrespectful situation. My mom asks if I can just sit next to her. I explain that that just makes her a buffer and I'm not going to spend 2 hours with them after being spoken to like that. My dad opens the door to the movies and says, ""get the f out of here and go home then.""

My lyft is 3 minutes away when my parents come back out. My dad insists on driving me home. It's silent the whole way.

Now, if this had been just an annoying parent situation, I could let it lie. But how he spoke to me felt demeaning and controlling. This isn't an uncommon occurence with him - that's why he referenced me ""running away."" He speaks to people in such an ugly way and then doesn't allow them to speak, so there's no point in trying to ""talk it through."" The only way I've successfully found to deal with it is to remove myself. Am I really being immature by doing this?",AITA for leaving the movies after getting in an argument with my dad?
969,AmItheAsshole,"       Alright so let me start off by saying i am a asshole. I have cheated on my gf multiple times. But she has made me crazy. In the beginning of the relationship she did some much childish petty shit and she also lied about a lot that made me pretty sure she cheated on me multiple times in the beginning of the relationship but i never truly got proof but this is off track. 
        So after all that shit i decided to stop, but this morning i woke up to here calling me and blowing my phone up about some petty shit again. I followed my ex on insta who is PREGNANT AND IS MARRIED NOW. She starts going off saying im cheating and im texting her. But this woman doesnt want anything to do with me. She has a God-fearing husband and they got that financial security type relationship ya know. But she’s not answering my calls or text saying she’s gonna text her ex. 
          So i finally get her otp and she’s yelling over me and im trying to tell her that it isnt a big deal and I’ll unfollowed her. She was like you’re giving excuses and blah blah blah. I finally break down crying cause she woke me up and i haven’t charged emotionally yet. I’m at like at 8% so once depleted i break down and i start crying telling her to stop yelling and she’s yelling saying no and that im an asshole and my mom comes in asking me whats wrong? I tell her im dating a crazy psycho bitch. And then she hangs up on me and i throw my phone muttering curses at the world and i storm out my house to go smoke a j and a hand-rolled cigarette. 
           By then i calm down and i decided to go assess the damage. My parents thank god arent home because the previous night i had a pent up frustration masturbation sesh that was intense and i left some things sprawled in my room and im pretty sure my mom saw it so i’ll have to deal with that later. But i digress so i call my gf back who has texted me her frustrations and called me a million times. And i calmly tell her how i feel. She just tells me is bullshit because i got caught so many times and i shoulda handled it better and i shoulda went outside and not cried. So my parents wouldnt hear. And that i shouldnt have even followed her back in the first place. But i already knew she was pregnant and had gotten married from her friends insta’s post so i figured who gives a fuck? Am i the asshole should i have conferred with my gf first or not have followed her back. Or can we not be adults in a relationship and just calmly address the situation?",AITA gf waking me up to her leaving me because i followed my pregnant married ex highschool gf? Im 21m and she’s 19f
970,AmItheAsshole,"I was extremely close to my grandmother. We talked all the time, send cards/gifts, and saw each other when possible. She lived over 9hrs away and being elderly, travelers as hard for her and with school, almost impossible for me to leave my state. 

Now I have been with my BF for over 3 years, and they have also talked on the phone, exchanged presents, cards, etc. He had only spent about a weeks worth of time with her, but Grandma approved and liked him a lot. 

So recently grandma had been sick, and she never fully recovered. We got the news she wasn’t doing well, and was expected to pass. I hopped in the car to try and drive there ASAP. I called BF and let him know as soon as I found out. She passed, unfortunately. 

Arrangements were made, and BF didn’t even offer to come up. The arrangements were at the end of the week so he would’ve missed 2 days of work. His work is the kind where he would have to make up those days on the weekend or the following week, but he could’ve told his boss he needed to go, without fear of being fired or anything. I called him on it, and he apologized and said “you know this is my busiest work week- I can’t swing it” 

So he didn’t come. Nor did he try to call my mom, or speak with her himself. He did not send flowers, or a card. This is the second funeral I’ve had to attend by myself, without any support or effort in his part and frankly I’m pissed as hell. 

So, AITA?",AITA for being upset my BF didnt come to grandmas funeral?
971,AmItheAsshole,"I’m lucky to be brought up where I am. Nice house, nice school, nice parents and an overall good life. But I feel myself getting mad, and a little bit jealous, and I’m wandering if I’m the asshole.

My sister, (18) I would say can be quite entitled sometimes, especially when it comes to getting what she wants. My parents don’t want to discipline her and buys her what she wants to avoid conflict.  Concerts, dinners with her friends, £80 a month for pocket money (I’m British), school related things (like dances and expensive trips), clothes etc etc. Despite all of this, she is rude to both my parents and I, and treats my mum in particular as if she is stupid and rarely spends time with her.

You can already see where this is going.  What I get, £10 a month pocket money, from which I buy all the things I want or need. School supplies, games, presents and everything really. I love my parents a lot and always spend time with them, and make sure to be good to them because I know how lucky I am and how hard their lives can be. In no way is this me sucking up to them. I do not expect anything from them, but it’s just recently crossed my mind about how much of a gap it is between what my rude ADULT sister gets, and what I get.

Some examples:
My parents buying my sister a £600 trip but are ‘unable’ to spend £10 for me to watch a show organised by school.
Me wanting to spend my OWN money on games, but being told to wait months on end for no valid reason, whereas handing my sister a £20 note to go buy whatever she wants with her friends.
Spending £75 on my sister’s hair being done when not needed, dying, trimming,  etc, but when I look like a wreck because my supposedly short hair covers my ears, can’t spend £10 on a quick hair cut.

Now they are complaining about not having enough money when they spend all of it on cigarettes for them, and things for my sister. AITA for being mad about this?","AITA for seeing my sister get all she wants, and feeling mad about it?"
1623,AmItheAsshole,"I (25F) have a 91 year old grandma. Last February she suffered a massive brain bleed. She now has some memory and speech impairment and she can no longer cook for herself but other than that she is still her same feisty self. She still lives in her own house but someone stays with her every night, my family takes turns checking in with her multiple times during the day, and there are nanny cams and life alert buttons throughout the house. I personally take her dinner and hang out with her for two hours everyday. She is my best friend and I am so grateful for the time I have with her. 

My Uncle Don winters in Arizona but he was back for his granddaughters birthday today and he stopped by my grandmas to say hi. Don wants my grandma to be in a home not because he thinks it’s what’s best for her but because he’s sick of checking on her when he’s home and he wants to sell her house to his son. He acts nice enough to her face (it’s super fake and she has noticed and asks why he bothers coming over when he just sits and watches tv without talking to her) but makes super passive aggressive snide comments to the rest of us about her and how he wants her in a home.  He’s out numbered by his siblings 3 to 1 so he deals with the arrangement. 

I was at grandmas when he came by and he walked in on my grandma talking about a really bad and painful experience that happened to her when she was about my age (short term memory is spotty but long term is mostly ok). He goes into the other room and loudly mutters “Jesus Christ it doesn’t matter.” Loudly enough for me and grandma to hear. It pissed me the fuck off so I got up and quietly but very very forcefully told him clearly it does still matter since she is talking about it 65 FUCKING YEARS LATER. I told him if he can’t be bothered to treat his mother like an actual human with thoughts and feelings he needs to get the fuck out. I told him he’s a piece of shit son since he can’t be bothered to respect her just because she’s been on earth longer than the rest of us.

He said nothing and just left. Grandma didn’t hear any of what I said so she was upset he left without saying goodbye. My mom is upset with how I said it but she is hopeful that this was a reality check for him. My other aunt and uncle are pissed at me and saying I overreacted and was unnecessarily an asshole and now my uncle Don is refusing to check on grandma when he’s back from Arizona. I fully admit I lost my shit and I do kind of regret what all I said but I also kinda feel like it was justified. So AITA?

EDIT: him refusing to check on her when he’s back means we may have to hire a part time home nurse year round rather than just during the winter like we have been. So I do feel like an asshole for causing this situation since home nurses are expensive.

INFO: my uncles caretaking duties included going over for 2-3 hours Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to make her lunch and keep her company. He never stays over night, only my mom, me, and my other uncle do that. My grandma does not need any assistance walking, dressing herself, or bathing. My mom does help wash her hair but I think that’s mostly because grandma likes having a “spa day” and it’s fun for them. We only have to help feed her, do her laundry, and give her her pills morning and night. Her brain damage affected her speech (sometimes she has a really hard time saying what she’s thinking or finding the right words), her memory (she knows she forgets stuff so she asks us to remind her of stuff quite a bit but it’s mostly minor stuff), her ability to read (it’s super weird if she focuses and tries to read she can’t but if she’s not thinking about it she can. If you’ve ever heard of something like that PM me), and her ability to run appliances. Since she has no trouble walking she’s not considered a fall risk aside from the fact that she’s 91 and shit can happen. Mainly she spends her days watching tv, puttsing around the house organizing and cleaning stuff, and hanging out with her cat. 

So basically she needs no additional medical care or nursing, she simply needs someone to check in with her to help out with chores and keep her company. Because of her age and the fact that shit can happen the doctor recommended we don’t leave her alone for more than 4 hours (plus she gets lonely easier since the brain bleed so she loves that we visit her so much). Unfortunately because of work my uncle Don who is retired is the only one with a schedule that allows him to go over for lunch duty during the week. My mom has looked into adult sitters in the area but unfortunately because of where we are the options are VERY limited. I’m honestly not sure what my mom has looked into regarding Medicare so I’m going to talk to her about that. It just sucks that we have to hire a home nurse that has a 4 hour minimum to simply go over and hang out and feed her. My mom did text me this morning and said we might be able to pay one of our family friends to hang out with her so that is awesome news. 

As for my uncle Dons relationship with his mom; they were great up until a couple years ago when he started to view her as a burden rather than a person. There was never a falling out with them, he simply got sick of visiting her. I mean he barely has to do shit to take care of her and he can’t even deign to do that so he just watches tv. He does talk with her sometimes and helps her out if she needs it but it’s the bare minimum. He’s generally not a dick with other things but when it comes to her he just has no empathy.

Also (sorry this is so long) the whole reason we have this arrangement is because grandma flat out refuses to leave her house. She and her husband built the house when she was 20 years old and she still views it as her greatest achievement. She grew up in an orphanage in the Great Depression so she has A LOT of pride in what she worked her ass off to achieve and she has said many many times that she wants to die in this house because it’s the only real home she’s ever had. We are doing everything we can to honor her wishes and keep her where she is as long as possible. I’ve talked to her many times about assisted living and it’s just not something she ever wants to do (although I’m sure at some point she will deteriorate to the point she doesn’t have a choice in the matter).",AITA for chewing out my uncle and telling him to leave?
1779,AmItheAsshole,"So I’m 19M in the US and recently I bought a new training karambit and butterfly knife. I’ve been learning a few tricks like openers and closers but not that much, I’ve messed up a few times but haven’t gotten cut since it is like super blunt.

So one night, I have a family gathering and my aunt, uncle, grandparents and parents are there along with my aunts children. Later on I get up to go the toilet and come back to see my little cousins scavenging around my room. I tell them to stop but they don’t then they find the blunt knives.

The aunt comes into the room and sees me taking the knives off my cousins. Immediately, she asks what’s going on so I explain. She demands that I get rid of the knives because “they are a danger” (keep in mind they are not sharp at all) and I said no because my cousins shouldn’t have been in my room in the first place AND they are blunt ones.

For around a week after this my aunt refused to talk to me or my parents and my parents had a chat but I explained it and they took my side which made me feel a bit better but I still feel a bit like an a-hole.

3395,AmItheAsshole,"Asking for my mom,

Our neighbour is a 50-something sick single mother with three boys, one with severe autism and one with adhd. My mom makes the crossword with her every week, goes to doctor appointments with her if she doesn't work, and walkes their dog every once in a while for fun. 

My neighbour and her kids are going on a trip across the country today (small country, dont worry lol), and couldn't walk the dog. She asked my mom to do it for them. My mom is sort of busy, but most importantly, doesn't want to do it. 

She doesn't feel guilty towards the neighbour, because she thinks ""she had to think of situations like this before getting a dog"", but does feel guilty towards the dog because ""he had no choice in this"".

3396,AmItheAsshole,"I just got off of a six hour international flight and I’m genuinely wondering whether I was the asshole. 

Background: I have pretty severe migraines that can be triggered by bright light. I was sitting in the middle seat in my row. The passenger in the window seat in the opposite row (she was seat A; I was seat E) had the window open and the glare was pretty bright. About 40 minutes in, the flight attendants came by with food and drinks, and I asked the flight attendant if he could ask her to close the window. He asked her and she looked annoyed. They had a short conversation and eventually she closed the window, but I could tell she wasn’t happy. I did hear him say “you can just use the overhead light” but she said that the angle of the light wasn’t good enough to read the book. 

When she later got up to go to the bathroom I said “I’m sorry, I just get really severe migraines from light.” She said something along the lines of “it’s fine, but honestly I paid to sit there so I could look out the window, so I don’t really want to keep it closed for the entire flight.” I did notice that she literally stopped reading and just sat there for the remaining five hours of the flight. 

I saw her again at baggage claim and she was complaining to a group of other people that the flight attendant made her close the window because “some lady across the aisle” didn’t like the light. I went over to her and said “look, I’m really sorry, but I told you that the light gives me migraines. I appreciate that you closed it.” She said basically that she understood, but she was upset because she’d wanted to read and look out the window, and she couldn’t read her book for the entire five hour flight because the angle of the overhead light meant that the light didn’t actually illuminate her seat. I apologized again and she just shrugged and reiterated that she paid for a window seat for a reason and said that if it's that big of an issue, I should try to get a window seat next time. It was palpably awkward. 

For the record, her tone was perfectly fine and I don’t think she was rude. But I’m wondering whether it was unreasonable for me to ask the flight attendant to ask her to close the window? It was a pretty long flight, and she was definitely upset when the flight attendant made her close it.
