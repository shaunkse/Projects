1,tifu,"Over the weekend I decided to catch a ferry to Pulau Ubin, a small island off the coast of Singapore. As context, from the ferry terminal, one simply exits the door marked ‘Pulau Ubin’, and boards twelve-person bumboats. The boats leave irregularly only once they are full, and the cash payment is made onboard. When I arrived to the ferry terminal, a large group was boarding, so I joined the crowd down the path and settled in. As three boats pulled away I noticed a general look of misery onboard, certainly far more than I would expect from a visit to a beautiful, tropical island. Some people carried flowers. With horror I realised that I had somehow gatecrashed a burial at sea. I sat there for an hour, trying to sink into my chair, whilst the boats rafted up and performed the ceremony. A Buddhist monk scattered the ashes and performed prayers, whilt others threw flower petals into the ocean. I felt terrible. After a time the boat headed back to shore, leaving me no closer to where I was going.
TLDR: Gatecrashed a Buddhist funeral, and all I got was this karma.",TIFU by getting on the wrong boat
2,tifu,"I feel like I'm a pretty cool dad. I wouldn't say I'm anything special, but I'm super easy going, supportive and encouraging towards my teen boys.

For the last few years, Josh, my youngest (now 14), has been playing pranks and jokes on me, and editing the videos and my responses to show his friends. He's even put some on YouTube, but they've never really taken off to the extent that he had hoped.  

Everything has been fairly harmless and I've never had an issue being the brunt of his pranks, I have though, been secretly plotting my revenge.

About six months ago, I contacted a TV Network in my home country, who put me in touch with the producers of a popular prank show aimed at kids. After much back and forth and a few telephone calls, the producers agreed that they would help me take my revenge on Josh in an elaborate to-be-broadcasted prank, that would see him, finally, as the protagonist. My eldest boy, Blake (15) was in on the prank, and was to play a part, alongside some actors that the show was going to provide.

Two days ago, one day before the intended prank, and whilst Josh was staying at a friends house, the TV producers and crew came to my house to setup all of their equipment, hidden cameras and props, for what was to be a ""home haunting"" special for their Halloween broadcast. 

The episode will never be broadcast. 

Both Josh and his friend (who was also not in on the intended prank) came home none the wiser and spent the early afternoon on the Xbox in his room. As prank time approached, I made the excuse of having to go and pickup some take away, and it was during this time that the ""haunting"" was due to take place. I drove my car to the next street, pulled up and was invited in to the makeshift producers gallery, in a temporary building on a neighbour's property.

Immediately, the crew sprang into action, rolling their cameras and coordinating their actors, my other son Blake, and their crew on their radios. 

I was paying attention to the presenter, who was being filmed, alongside me, observing the prank that was about to unfold, when all of a sudden I heard the words, ""TERMINATE, TERMINATE, TERMINATE"" screamed from the seat beside me. I thought that this was part of the show and giggled with delight as I took my attention off of the presenter and faced the camera monitors next to me, to watch the prank begin. 

To my absolute shock, the hidden cameras at home were showing my son, and his friend engaged in oral sex. I froze up for a moment, processed what was going on and ran back to the house, where I was forced to intervene and tell Josh everything that was happening.

I have never seen my kid so absolutely horrified in his life. He went pale, vomited everywhere and cried uncontrollably for about 2 hours. His friend was equally distraught and I done my best to keep them as calm as possible, whilst I tried to work out what to do. I'm still not sure that I have done the right thing. 

I booked a hotel, and took both my kids there, and left the TV crew, under my neighbours supervision to pack everything up. I dropped Josh's friend to his house, but have not yet discussed the matter with his parents - though they are aware something went wrong during the filming of the show, but that everyone was okay. 

I am still at the hotel tonight with both the boys, and I have not heard from the producers yet. Josh hasn't really spoken to me or opened up all day, and I'm not sure how to approach the subject, other than with apologies and support. 

I am 90% sure that Blake has told his friends, even though he says he hasn't.

Today I fucked up.

TL;DR - Prank on son went wrong, with tens of people watching, perhaps scarring him, irreparably, for life.",TIFU by pranking my son.
3,tifu,"Obligatory “this happened last weekend”. 


So my lovely friend is a big fan of “Hot Ones” and an even bigger fan of hot sauce. For those of you who don’t know, Hot Ones is a show where celebrities eat 10 increasingly hot wings while answering questions. Now lovely friends lovely girlfriend gifted him each of the ten hot sauces that are featured in the show, so last weekend we decided to create our very own version. 


So with 10 pounds of wings, hot sauce, and 3 bags of milk (Canada) we embarked on this journey. Now I’m no stranger to hot sauce, but I’d rather taste my food rather than taste nothing but Lucifer’s bussy, but I’m a chill gal and I like to try new things. 


Surprisingly, I made it to hot sauce number 7 with no problems. So cue hot sauce number 8. I was warned that this one would be quite more *sparkly* so I did the reasonable thing and only took a tiny nibble. Despite that my whole mouth felt like a fiery inferno. Everyone was panting as if they were trying to expel a demon. I was chugging milk as if I were a newborn hungry cow. 


20 minutes later, my mouth felt more like the prickly sensation like physical static television, but at this point I had chugged over 3 solo cups full of milk (I had poured some from the bag directly into my mouth as well). I haven’t had a full glass of milk in basically a decade. 


So my late life induced lactose semi-intolerance started to kick in and I could feel myself needing to.... you know go to the bathroom? No big deal, everyone’s feeling the same, no problem. So I go to “relieve myself”. 


Well turns out I should have thoroughly washed my hands before because the tips of my fingers must have brushed my hoo-hah and suddenly it felt like I was receiving cunnilingus from a hot wing disguised as the devil. 


It has been 4 days and I’m thinking I’m going to need to see a doctor now. So ladies, please don’t be like me and don’t let your fingers near ya vajay after eating hot wings. 


And also don’t do the hot ones challenge because you’ll end up drinking a litre of milk and having to repeatedly go to another room to avoid blinding your new girlfriend with farts that smell like a small animal died and decayed in your anus. 


TL;DR hot wings + vagina = ouch",TIFU by doing “Hot Ones”
4,tifu,"This happened Saturday night. My wife and I both frequent a relatively cheap ""Asian massage"" place that has a typical variety of reflexology, massages, etc. We've probably been to this place 50-60 times in 5 years. Every time is essentially exactly the same. We get our massage, pay $40 and tip after. My wife usually would to tip $10 each but over the years we've increased this to $20 because I feel like the people working there are obviously immigrants from China and probably living at that place and not making all that much money. 

Anyway, this Saturday evening I went solo as my wife was out of town and everything was the same except for the fact that out of the blue the massage girl started massaging my ass rather intrusively. Like, way too deep into the crack area and I'm on my stomach, don't speak Chinese, and her English is basically zero so um okay. I'm not a prude or anything but I'm also not a guy who has ever gotten happy endings so I'm like okay this is uncomfortable because my anus is being greased up and this is kinda weird no matter how you look at it but she's not jerking me off so I just wait out the probably 20-30 seconds of unwanted fondling. But then she returned to the region again with like knuckles first and I start to like clench my butt cheeks and seriously consider whether I'm going to get a finger (or worse) massaging my innards. 

Fondling stopped and she asked me to flip on to my back, which I did. At this point I notice that she's wearing this super skimpy bright red dress like she's at a night club. Bear in mind that up until this point I hadn't seen her. That's when I am thinking okay wait have I ever been here on a Saturday night before and did I just discover that our favourite cheap massage joint transforms into a shady rub and tug on Saturday nights?Uh oops?

After the usual head and neck massage she goes to my legs and starts to literally like rub her hands all the way into my crotch and make contact with my balls and naturally I pop a boner. But I'm like fuck this and said ""no don't touch there"" and she replies in some kind of awkward sexy voice like ""oh baby don't worry I no touch big boy."" Ah yeah aaaaawkward. But she then retreated her hands to my feet and rubbed my feet for like 10 minutes.

Massage ends, my ass crack and balls are still greasy AF, like practically dripping in Chinese motor oil and I'm just puzzled and wondering why tonight after 5 years of this place being legit and totally not sexual is this happening.

I walk out (with a greasy anus, it feels weird to walk) and this massage girl is standing there at the front desk with the customary cup of water and I take it without making eye contact then pay my $40 and give her the $20 tip and figure I'll just duck out and pretend nothing happened because I'm not in the mood to prolong this awkwardness. But then the massage girl literally looks at the $20 bill like it was a $1 bill and SCREAMS something in Chinese at which point the woman at the desk snaps back at her and points at the door that leads to the rooms for her to go back there. It was kind of the gesture you'd use if you were talking to a misbehaving dog. Then the desk lady says ""oh she say most give her $50 or $60"" and I'm just like ""um I come here a lot and I always give $20"" and then the lady says ""it's okay next time you ask for susu you can give $50"" and then I'm just doing that awkward mini bow to Asian people even though I'm not Asian thing as I nope the F out of there because I am thinking I need to find a new cheap massage place. I never even asked for susu!

Edit: Somebody paid me 250 coins and now I feel like an anal prostitute. Thanks reddit.

A little back round I’m a university student

Everyday my alarm goes off at exactly 6 am but today I guess I didn’t hear it this day. I woke at 630 (classes start at 7:00)and live 15 minutes away from campus. I rushed out of bed ate some granola bars and headed to the dresser. I guess I pulled up too hard and fast on the zipper on my jeans cause the tip of penis got caught. Blood gushing out of my dong and needed to be at class as soon as possible. Blood covered my clothes but I knew I fucked something up badly. Instead of going to class like usual I had to catch an Uber to hospital.

6,tifu,"TIFU...Ten Years Ago I Fucked Up...  By marrying my highschool sweetheart.  Throwaway because...it should be evident.

Strap in...this is going to suck for you and me both, but I gotta do it.  For me.

Typical story, boy meets girl, boy and girl stay together for years, boy and girl get married and have kids.

In comes the wrench.  7 years ago, my wife decides to become a complete religious nutcase.  All sex is bad and it's only slightly less bad if it results in procreation.  Basically a complete halt to our sexual relationship.  Nada.  Nothing.  No warning, just one day she comes home and says ""we're not having sex anymore"" and she stops taking birthcontrol.

At this point, I start looking at annulment options and divorce.  Alas, I missed my escape window.  2 months later, she tells me she's pregnant.  I can't leave now.  There's a kid.

Kid is amazing and I love the kid very much...could never leave that kid.

The next two years, wife pulls progressively further and further away.  Almost no physical contact at this point, outside of sex one time per month...and sometimes not even that.  No kissing, no hugging, nothing.  I get no emotion and no affection from her at all.  But I can't leave.  Not for the kid.

Then BAM.  Pregnant again.  We both come from fertile families, so it's not unexpected that one fuckup ends up with a kid.  Second kid comes and that kid is absolutely wonderful and I love both kids more than anything in the world.  Well shit, definitely can't leave now.

The last five years have been absolute hell for me.  I've changed jobs and we have absolutely no financial stress whatsoever, but my wife just will not touch me.  She barely talks to me, other than to complain or ask me for something.

She still wants sex once per month, but outside of that, there's just nothing.  There's nothing romantic about it at all.  She checks her calendar, checks her temperature, and says ""it's that time, go.""  Inevitably, I always feel worse after.  I can't have sex on a schedule.

I've tried to spice things up.  We went on a tropical trip for our 10 year anniversary.  No sex.  In fact, I ended up having to jack off in the bathroom while my wife sat naked on the bed ignoring me.  How fucking fucked up is that?

I suggested we go to marriage counseling.  We went, but not in good faith.  My wife had no intention of making changes.  I started going to church with her in hopes that some good faith compromise might be possible.  Nothing.  No effect.

So here I am, 10 years and two kids into a marriage with a woman that refuses to touch me, refuses to talk to me, refuses to listen, takes no interest in anything I have interest in, and won't do a damn thing to make things better.  And somehow, when I try to talk to her about it, she gets offended and acts like she's the injured party.

So, that's my fuckup.  Ten years in the making.

Fuck me, right?

tl;dr:  married highschool sweatheart, she turned into a frigid bitch, now I'm stuck in a loveless marriage with two kids I can't leave.

Update:  Thanks for all the constructive (and unconstructive) criticism.  I attempted to talk to her last night and re-engage and she just sat there and didn't say anything.  I will try again tonight.  To those who are criticizing me: yes I'm a selfish coward and terrified of not seeing my kids every day, no I'm not a 400lb incel, yes I realize I'm partly to blame for being so passive, no I'm not really looking for advice I just wanted to vent.

7,tifu,"This happened about 10 years ago, but I thought it's too embarrassing not to share.

My girlfriend at the time (now my wife) invited her sister round for a movie night before she was due to go to Australia for a year. Kind of like a send off, with a movie, pizza and beer. Sounds fun right.

So we were all set up and we just needed to pick a movie. I thought it would be a great idea to hook my laptop up to the TV so that we could pick one of my latest downloads to watch. You can probably see where this is going.  

Once I've successfully logged in, I see my girlfriend and her sisters face go red and notice they've stopped talking. 

This is when I realise I've left my porn folder open and it's displaying on our TV for both them to see in vivid detail (for some reason I thought it was good idea to have that folder display everything in large thumbnails too) Not to sure if it makes it worse but it was homemade POV porn we made, so my dick was definitely on display.

Anyway I quickly close the folder and try to divert their attention. The night from that point onwards was awkward and we've never talked about it since.

Two hours later I am in a room with my friend, my boss, my friend's boss, some executive, two HR ladies, and someone who I think was a lawyer discussing how I called my friend the N word. Someone, who was most likely white or Asian since there are very few black people in tech and neither of us remember seeing any other black people around us, over heard me say ""nizzle"" and reported it. I didn't know that nizzle was slang for the N word but they showed me the definition in the Urban Dictionary as proof. My friend said that even he didn't know that nizzle meant the N word but he said the actual N word. One of the HR people told him not to use racist language and he had to point out that he was the only one qualified to say that word since he happens to be black and everyone else in the room was white. They gave me a warning and made me apologize to my friend.

9,tifu,"So for a little backstory, I have alopecia and I have to draw my eyebrows on every morning. (which can be incredibly frustrating and time consuming trying to get them to match) I woke up late this morning and didn't have my usual 20 minutes to perfect the damn things like I normally do, so I thought what the hey. I see plenty of other girls at work with half-assed hair or half-assed make up (or no make up), maybe I'll just go with the casual slightly messy look today. All day long people were asking me if I was OK or that I looked worried, and when I finally got a chance to look in the mirror, holy shit, my right eyebrow was higher than my left eyebrow. And not just slightly higher, like half an inch higher. I was only halfway through my shift and still had 4 hours to suffer through people asking me ""what's wrong"" with the now awareness of my rogue brow. I had to talk to a lot of people face to face today, I was so embarrassed

10,tifu,"Spaghetti is a staple of my diet. It's fast, it's easy to cook, it requires minimal dish-washing, it's tasty, and it's reasonably healthy. If I'm making myself dinner at home alone, there's a high chance it's going to be spaghetti.

Sometimes I will add oregano and basil to the water as it boils to give the pasta itself a little more flavor. I love spicy food, so today I decided to add some cayenne pepper powder to the water as it boiled, to infuse the pasta with a little kick. This is not the first time I've done this, but I guess it's the first time I've done it in my small kitchen while forgetting to cover the pot.

So I put the water on and went to change out of my work clothes. When I came back, the water was just starting to boil. Apparently enough steam had been released, and enough cayenne dissolved within, that the whole kitchen had spicy air. Now my nose burns, my throat burns, and I can't stop coughing. My spice tolerance is usually very high, but...well, not in my nose, I guess.

11,tifu,"Alright guys so some backstory, 

I am a very disorganized person and have always been. I wouldnt say I struggle with cleanliness (ie; dirt and dust etc) but i struggle with neatness. There is always loose and random objects and papers on my desk that I dont even remember putting on it ever. 

This week I was going to finally get around to organizing my room and cleaning the rest of it up as my family has company coming later this week. So I start cleaning and I get to my desk and I begin to wipe down my desk and get all the junk off of it and there is some change on my desk. So as im wiping it down I scoop up some change and then all of a sudden I see a bright flash of light emanate from behind my desk and all the lights and electronics (including my new PC) shut off instantly. I start to panic. I slid the desk away from the wall and see that a penny fell perfectly in line with where my outlet was and I guess the surge protector/power strip was slightly loose from the outlet and it fell exactly into the two prongs and shorted out my entire circuit in my room. Nothing was coming on and I had thought not only my pc was broken but my rooms electric had been fried somehow from this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after some frantic, sweaty googling I learned how to reset my circuit breaker and I got everything working fine and got a new power strip from elsewhere before plugging it all back in and giving it a shot.

Thankfully nothing is broken and it all seems to be ok and I think were good though. But my god that was a close call and everyone just look at your plugs and make sure that they arent loose or at least there are no pennies around to fuck your shit all the way up.

12,tifu,"Suffice to say this is United Airlines so not the best experience or customer service.

I have a small bladder anyway but I ran five miles on the treadmill this morning and then drank two gatorades on the way to the airport.

Because it’s United we’ve been on the tarmac over an hour not moving and the pilot keeps saying “we’re waiting for some authorization to go forward.”  I hate to be that person so I hold it as long as I can but finally as the flight attendant comes by I ask her if I can use the bathroom and she says “yes but hurry”

I go quickly and while I’m peeing I hear the pilot over the loudspeaker “we have authorization to go as soon as everyone is back in their seats”.  I pee as fast as I can, don’t even wash my hands and am back in my seat in 30 seconds.  The whole thing took maybe 90 seconds.

Two minutes after I’m back in my seat pilot gets back on “hey sorry guys it’s one of those days, they gave us authorization when someone had to use the bathroom, now another plane is in front of us so it’s going to be a while”.  I slink in my seat and try not to make eye contact with anyone.

Then another update 15 minutes later “we’re now the 8th plane in line and takeoff will be in 45 minutes”

I think this pilot is A. Being a dick and B.  Lying because it’s hard to believe my one minute pee set us back an hour but we’re still on the plane, haven’t taken off yet and everyone is shooting daggers at me.  I’m the asshole that caused everyone to be delayed.  

TLDR had to pee before takeoff because we were on the tarmac so long and my 90 second pee caused an hour long delay","TIFU by needing to use the bathroom before takeoff, causing a delay and having the whole plane hate me"
13,tifu,"Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons, and obligatory ""this happened last night not today.""  Also sorry this is a bit long, see TLDR below.

We have some very close friends who have been struggling for about 10 months to get pregnant. We have 3 kids of our own, so this has been hard for us to watch and honestly been a bit of our strain on an otherwise very close relationship.

Anyhow, over ""I just started my period so I'll do what I want"" drinks, our friends started unloading about how stressful the whole situation has been for them, and the wife started tearing up a bit. In a moment of earnestness, I went for the old go-to, ""Is there anything I can do to help?""

I had NO IDEA how loaded of a question this was going to be. Instantly, the husband, my good friend, looked at me and said ""would you do that for us?"" W. T. F.

Then the wife chimed in with something like ""we hadn't actually decided on asking you yet, but since you brought it up we can all just talk about it here..""

They go on to say that they had recently discussed the possibility of looking for a sperm donor after finding out at a doctor's visit that it is probably a ""him issue"" and there chances of natural conception would be quite low, though not impossible (sperm quality issue? i don't know the details). Unfortunately, they don't have much money and had created a short list of candidates to do it ""the old fashioned way."" The list includes me, the husband's BROTHER so they would be genetically related, or a total stranger. Yikes.

Honestly, this was fine.  A little awkward, but not altogether fucked up.  It's 2020 and we're all adults.

The real fuck up came when my wife asked what I thought about it all once our friends had left.  She asked in a pretty lighthearted way, so I said ""It's a little weird, but I'm always down to help a friend out.""  This was not the right answer, boys and girls.

Apparently, unbeknownst to me, my wife has always thought I had a crush on this girl [I haven't]. She asked me angrily if I was serious, and I explained honestly that it would be a big decision that we could make together but I really would do it if it meant our friends getting to have a baby.  Fight ensues, wife spins into crazy territory (we fought about everything from who picked my son's name to how often we dog-sit for my mom).  Went to bed angry, woke up sad and went to work without speaking.  Fortunately Wednesdays are our weekly date night, so I'm hoping we can sort it all out tonight.

TLDR; my best friend wants me to knock up his wife because his sperm are lazy, and my wife is very angry that I think it isn't actually that bad of an idea.

 To my horror I realized it was the wrong picture, one of my schlong, ding dong, penis, dick! 

It was too late to be able to unsend my dong to the group chat. I tried spamming them with texts of random words so they wouldn’t be able to see the picture unless they scrolled up, but a few people already had responded with a “wtf” or a “wrong chat?” before I could hide it. I then sent the ultrasound, but it was too late. Everyone was confused and angry. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to talk to them every again.

15,tifu,"This actually happened 20 years ago and I seem to have blocked this whole ordeal out of my memory and for some reason it sprung back into my mind today at 35.

Okay so where to start with this.

When I was about six years old I was playing in the pool and laying on a surfboard  on my stomach getting pulled around by a friend. My dick must have been in a weird position laying upwards (if that makes sense) and when the surf board hit the side of the pool, I slid forward and it forced my little six year old foreskin back. All I remember is a lot of crying and remember seeing a bit of blood on my dick.

Fast forward to puberty and I'm starting to get an idea of what my dick should be doing. All the porn I've seen at this stage are men with circumcised dicks. I didn't have a Dad around and had no idea how foreskin was supposed to work or that I even had to clean under it.

I couldn't pull my foreskin back, it was so tight around my head it was impossible without a lot of pain. It went about halfway down my head and that's as far as it would go. Masturbating was not a lot of fun but I just thought that's what it was supposed to feel like. I also had big lumps half the size of marbles just under the head of my dick all around it that I also thought were normal. They were not.

Okay so I'm 15 and masturbating in the bathroom, as you do, and suddenly my dick got incredibly itchy. Under the head of my dick, an area I thought could not be accessed by an uncircumcised man. I started rubbing vigorously all around the head trying to scratch the itch.

I pulled my foreksin back a little and my whole head was covered in smegma.
 
Like fucking covered.

I washed it off and gave my dick another squeeze.

Pulled back as much as I could, covered again.

I knew something wasn't right. It was getting messy and smelly so I decided to hop in the shower at this stage.

I squeezed the fuck out of my poor dick, forcusing on the little marble sized balls under my head. I don't know if it was the heat of the shower loosening up my skin or my utter fear and panic, but all of a sudden my foreskin just slides back and reveals the most horrific scene under the head of my dick.

It was probably a shotglass worth of smegma caked under there. Off white and pale yellow of the smelliest cottage-heese like substance.

I cleaned my dick for probably half an hour after that, making sure it was spotless. All underneath was red raw and very wrinkly like when you've been wearing wet socks all day. It stayed like that for about a week before healing up and now it looks normal.

 I just remember being so happy I finally had a normal dick, but also being disappointed that my dick was now half the size.

16,tifu,"Now, I already know I shouldn't mix adderall and caffeine, because I've done it in the past and it usually leads to me having a panic attack, which then turns into a seizure. I'm prescribed to take adderall for adhd, prozac for depression/anxiety, and ativan for panic disorder and seizures.

So I'm currently in the middle of exams week and my dumbass decided to take 6 adderall at 10:30pm last night to help me keep studying. Come 12:00, i'm ready to go to bed so I try to settle down, but no matter what I couldn't sleep. 

So, instead of studying I played minecraft for the entire night/morning. On my way to school this morning I stopped and picked up a 24oz Monster Energy, a 16oz Monster Energy, and two 5hr Energies. I had also taken 7 more adderall before i left home to keep myself awake. 

I got to my first exam and walked in, the first thing I said was ""Hi Mr.[Teacher's Name], I haven't slept in 36 hours!"" Obviously I was kinda delirious and out of it, so he laughed and said that I looked like it. I went to my desk and pulled out my empty water bottle and poured in the first 24oz Monster. My teacher looked visibly concerned, due to the fact that a lot of people know that energy drinks like Bang or Monster cause me to have seizures because of the medicine I also take.

I poured the second monster in and pulled out the two 5hr energy. My teacher was definitely much more concerned, repeating his signature ""Strong Veto"" phrase when someone does something he doesn't like. He was laughing a little bit, so I only poured one of the 5hr energies in to keep him content. I stirred it around and took a sip and a few of my classmates, the ones who knew how out of it I was, watched on in fear and laughter. 

After the first half of the test, with 40 minutes left in class, I managed to write a 6 paragraph, 4 page essay on all of the four units we'd covered in the class so far. I still don't know how. 

Now here's the fuck-up part. I was on my way home and about halfway, I pulled over and got out of my car, throwing up. I was out there for a good ten minutes before I managed to make it back to my house, where I spent another 30 minutes in the bathroom throwing up. Once I was sure I was completely empty, I went to my room and crawled into bed, taking one of my benzo pills, as I was starting to show the symptoms of having a seizure. I lay down and tried to relax myself, but I was shaking pretty violently, and my heart beat was so loud.

I'm writing this 5 hours later, and I still feel fucked. My head is really heavy and I still feel nauseous and I just don't feel good at all.

So yea, clearly didn't learn my lesson the first time, lets see if the second gets the message through my brain. Substituting sleep for adderall and monster energy during midyear exams is not the way to go..

TL;DR i substituted sleep for adderall and energy drinks and had a seizure because of it :)",TIFU by mixing adderall and caffeine
17,tifu,"This happened last year but anyways...

Background information: I(F19) had met this really attractive guy at a school event and we really hit it off. Unfortunately, he lives six hours away and it was summer so we could only text/Snapchat. Since we got along really well and were into each other we talked dirty and exchanged some racey(not nudes) pics. 

Eventually he sent a dick pic and wanted a pic of me. I had never sent nudes before because I was rightfully afraid of sending it to the wrong person but I was into it and I took a pic of my boob(only boob, no face or anything)and sent it to him. 

I asked him if he liked it and he said he hadn’t gotten it yet. I then get a message from my high school aged brother that said something along the lines of: “Delete me off Snapchat. I didn’t mean to replay it, it was an accident”. I’m like ok weird but I go to Snapchat to delete him. Then I see his name is at the top with image replayed. 

With a sinking feeling in my gut, I realized what had happened. I hadn’t messaged him in weeks and his name is nothing similar to the guys name but for some reason Snapchat fucked up. I had sent my first nude to my brother and he replayed it. 

So I learned my lesson that day, create a separate account for sending nudes incase it gets sent to your brother. Who replays it. We have never spoken of that incident to this day.

18,tifu,"Gotta mention that my family is not well off so if someone in the family has more than 2 devices(device as in phone laptop etc. Not pc tho) they have to give the oldest one to a sibling with no devices one. Anyways Onto the story

Last week i got a new phone and decided i don't need the old crappy phone anymore so i gave it to my younger sister after moving the ""homework"" document into my new phone and not deleting it thinking that move means that it will move the document and not copy it (big mistake)
My sister is the typical 10 year-old with an insane love for Barbie's so she instantly installed a bunch of Barbie games like Barbie dress-up etc. 

Onto today.

she was unable to install more games so she went into storage to see what's taking up all the space that isn't her games and  found out that documents was using 2gigabytes of memory so she wanted to know what's in it and explored a little then she stumbled upon my ""homework"" document and looked into it and instantly she ran around the house showing everyone in my family about what atrocities i keep in that document and now nearly all of my family either hates me or is disgusted by me 
Right now i have locked myself in my bedroom with 3 days worth of food and a good supply of water from my filtered tap

TLDR: gave sister old phone that had the ""homework"" document now the whole family knows

So it's summer time and it's really hot. Me and my girlfriend, now wife, are checking out banff national park. And we're in the town site. I wanted to get out of the heat, so i suggested we go into a sporting goods store and check it out. And maybe enjoy some AC. We had been exploring for a while so i was getting exhausted from the heat and walking.

As we're looking around the store, they have 2 levels. I look to the one side of the stairs and it looks like they have another room behind the stairs. So i start off in that direction. I'm so tired that i'm just shuffling along and staring at the floor completely out of it. I come upon another pair of shoes directly in front of. 

I say excuse me and shuffle to the right, they shuffled to there left. I say excuse me again and shuffle to the left this time. They side step with me. I'm like what the funk is going on here. 

I look up to talk to them directly and find myself staring at a reflection of none other than yours truly. I just say oh my god and turn around to see if anyone saw it. Well my girl is busting a gut cause she saw and heard the whole interaction. I thought it was pretty funny to and started laughing. No one else in the store had seen it and there were no cameras. My wife and i still laugh pretty hard at this though.

20,tifu,"Hey Reddit people!  


Context: 28M single, live in a non-English speaking country. English is not my mother tongue, so I am sorry for any possible mistakes that may appear. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  


So all of this starts with me browsing through Tinder. The usual. Left, Right, Left, Right. Eventually, [this](https://imgur.com/4wLyQdw) appears. So, a huge part of me knows this is not serious and probably some scam... but also (and this was mistake number one) I thought I was above getting scammed so I went ahead and saved the number. I was bored, so why not? Let's have a laugh.

I whatsapped ""her"". She answers, sends me a video of her lying in bed. Clothes on and everything, nothing special. Just a hot girl laying in bed. She tells me she's in the Hilton hotel and she wants to meet somebody.   
I ask her for location and she sends me her location. She was in the Hilton hotel, 2km from mine. 

She says that before I go there, she wants to know what she's getting into; I need to send her a dick video. ""Why not"" I thought, and then went ahead. She wants to masturbate together on video chat now. Because I wasn't home and wasn't available at the time I said no. That could've been it. But no... I am such a horny idiot.  
Three days later I stumble with the chat again. 

I said ""Hi"" and she answers,"" do you want to come over?"". Just writing this right now I am getting more and more embarrassed, because how stupid can I be? I guess just part of me was clinging to some stupid improbable story because I wanted it to be true. I thought the most plausible thing was her being a prostitute or an escort of some type, to which case I would just have said no and end of story. Less than an hour wasted and that's it. Worst case. Best case: awesome sex story.   
Spoiler alert: worst case was really worst.  


So I hop on my vehicle and go. She told me to let her know when I was in the lobby and she would come down. That's what I did and she says: ""send me a dick video"". I refer the last video i sent in the chat and she tells me ""it's really important, if you don't send me a video where you lick your lips like you would be doing if you had me in front of you and then show me how you touch yourself I won't go. Go to the toilet and send me this"". Red flag number 10000. I still went through. So there was I, going to the toilet in the hotel lobby. Stupid fucker. Then she didn't believe it was me. So, selfie in the lobby. Then she still didn't believe it and wanted to videochat. I called her through whatsapp and she didn't pick up. She tells me she can't do wp, she wants to do FB messenger. I didn't feel comfortable with this, so I offered Skype. Called her fake username like twice (SaraDavis8908232 or some number like this), she never picked up. Eventually after some nonsense negotiation like this, she says: ""ok, I am coming down."". Except she never did. 10 min go by, I checked whatsapp and she had blocked me.  


Stuff starts hitting home. My surname was in skype. By no account I am named John Smith or Muhamad Li or something common, so I am not difficult to find online. Although, only professional stuff. I am pretty safe with my social media and stuff. Anyway, I start going protocol zero on my social and locking all my accounts from public mode and deactivating a couple too. 

Get home, started to take care of business, already forgetting about the thing. ""If they can't find me in social media, what will they do? I'm safe."" Right? WRONG.  
Fucking Facebook.   
My friend list was always invisible to the public, but I don't know who was the genius that decided you can't put a padlock on cover or current profile pictures. There's like 80 likes in there, plus comments.  
I get a message from another American number, named ""Kevin"" and the stockiest picture I've seen ever. ""I found my wife cheating with you and I broke her 5000 dollars laptop. If you don't pay, I'll send the video to all of your friends and family. Even your employer"". He sends me a picture (not even a print screen, a picture of the display hehehe) with the list of likes from my cover picture. He specially took pictures of my brother and cousin's profile (they had the same surname and they were in the like list). Also, a picture where it said in my profile where I work. Immediately I block the number.

Of course there's no way in hell I would've payed. Like wtf, I was masturbating.. fuck you asshole, I am not gonna give you a dime for masturbating. I was super bummed out because I really didn't want people to see my video masturbating, but that was it. They were not going to fire me, if anything they would've contained me emotionally at work. I was just bummed out because of the possible scenario of having to apologize to people for having seen that video. Nothing to be ashamed of, but yeah... sucks.

Luckily, (crossing fingers though), the video still hasn't surfaced. My current line of thought is that:  


\- The guys wants my money. They have leverage on me.

\- If he releases the lever, there's no incentive for me to pay. 

\- Even worse, it could be more easy to trail back to him.

\- Probably he moved on to the next victim.

There was no more contact with the scammers.   


A week has passed and I am considering enabling Facebook again.   
Lesson learned: **nobody is too good to be scammed**, and, **if it looks to good to be true it's because it is.**

Have a laugh at me, no problem. I am currently laughing myself (there's not much else to do). I am publishing this here so that more people are aware of this assholes beforehand. Read online that this stuff sometimes lead to suicides or bankrupts; so stay safe and remember there's no shame in sexuality!

Today was pretty great, I went to school had some super easy work that I got done, talked with friends and went home with my girlfriend. 
After a while my older sister comes by and asks if we wanna go get thai food with her. Being broke students we of course said yes and left to go get our thai. This thai food truck isnt too fancy but it has a scale of spice from 1-5. 1 being a baby could eat it, 5 being this will physically harm you. My girlfriend and I both enjoy some spicy food so we decided to settle for a 3.

After we get home and try our food we realized that even a 3 pushed it for even us, but still happily ate because it was still bearable. After we ate we said goodbye while she worked and I went with my sister to run some errands for the remainder of the day. After getting back home tonight we made enchiladas for dinner and they were delicious, not too spicy and had the perfect amount of sauce to pork to tortilla ratio. 

Then... I regretted all my life choices. My stomach felt like it was burning, combined with the feeling of needing to take an ungodly shit. I had to get to the bathroom fast. The next minutes may have been the most horrific of my life. It was like I was giving birth to a ball of fire and it was cooking my asshole with bleach.

24,tifu,"Well I never thought I’d ever have anything interesting enough to post on this sub, but here I am. 

This all took place over the course of today after lunch.  Before I get to far into today’s events, a little back story. Over the last 2 years I had 2 tumors that grew on my small intestines. Both were successfully removed. But it required some of my small intestines to be cut in a few places. After healing up, I have to more careful of what I eat. Specially spicy food, which I absolutely love most hotter dishes.  Second side note: I’m currently fighting the flu that’s been going around. Got a nasty sinus infection, so my ability to smell is very much lacking. 

Onto the FU of today. I get off work at 9am. Walk to my fiancées apartment. She gets off work at 11am. Comes home and cooks us some lunch. She’s Indonesian, and through her I’ve found that Indonesian food is amazing. A lot of their dishes are spicy hot. She’s sweet enough that she knows I have to be careful around spicy foods now, so she will make a side dish for me that’s more mild. Today’s menu was fried rice and fried eggs. On of my favorite things she makes. 

Fuck up number 1 for the day started here. I told her just to make the food how she likes and I’ll eat it. It was spicy but amazing. I knew I’d regret it but it was just too good to not eat as much as I can. After the meal everything was fine. We hung out for a while until I had to drop her off at her night job. I head home to pick my 6 year old son up from daycare. 

Once home I can feel my guts processing the food, little gassy but it’s ok. I feed my son dinner and help him with his homework. After homework was time for him to get a shower. He got his shower and after getting out said he had to go to the bathroom. I let him do his thing. He comes out laughing like a lunatic after a couple minutes. My son loves practical jokes. 
At this time my guts have decided enough is enough. I had to go to the bathroom. This was the price I paid for eating spicy food. I accepted my fate as I sat there with what felt like lava coming out of me. 

Fuck up number 2 time. Had I been thinking, I would have investigated what my son was up to in the bathroom. But because of my guts I forgot about it. 
After I’m finished being a human volcano I look at the toilet paper roll. It’s soaking wet. This wouldn’t be the first time my offspring got water on the TP thinking it’s a funny joke. I said fuck it and used it anyways since it was the last roll in the bathroom. A few seconds after cleaning up I felt the burn. The burn got increasingly worse. That’s when I looked next to the toilet and saw the fabreze can sitting there. At that moment I knew what he was laughing about. Because of the flu and me not being able to smell a damn thing  I had no clue the bathroom smelled like “meadows &amp; rain”.  A cold shower followed that didn’t offer much relief. Now I’m in bed, some of the pain has gone away. Never trust a child with evil grin laughing.

The following day I go to the bathroom, and somehow that hair tie ever existing completely got erased from my mind and I didnt recognize it either, since it was a new set, not my usual style, and I guess i just randomly pulled it out on the plane without paying any attention to what it looked like. I see it on the sink and obviously, knowing it cant be mine, I get all sad about it and stay depressed and in emotional turmoil the whole day wondering what I am gonna say to my boyfriend in regards to the mystery tie and how I'm gonna give him my ""I need you to be completely honest"" speech. 

Nevertheless, I had to go to the gym that evening and needed hair ties so I go to my bag, knowing I bought some, and pull out the new set. And guess what? One of the hair ties is missing. So I go to the bathroom, and sure enough. It's a perfect match to my set.

I facepalm, get out of the bathroom and shamefully tell my bf the story, secretly being happy I was even tempered and didnt make a big, dramatic scene out of it, because, God, now that would have been really embarrassing.

27,tifu,"I'm going to give you a little context first, also throwaway for obvious reasons.

So I'm a sad 21 year old virgin who, when he was 20, said fuck it and bought a fleshlight. As you can expect I had very lonely but happy moments with said toy.

The problems began when I decided to craft a mount for said Fleshlight in order to use it hands free while being sat on my chair. 

At first I thought I was a genius, some kind of mad scientist who had found the cure to cancer but it didn't take too long for me to be led astray by lust... 'cause one day... I went at it for a good hour of non-stop action, edging my way to an hour long session. As it turns out, that was a very bad move.

Soon I started doing this hour long sessions pretty often until one day while washing my self after the deed, I noticed my frenulum was red and it kind of hurt. Thankfully, I, having a big brain, put a stop to this nonsense to give my penis a chance to recover, unfortunately I miscalculated how long it would take for it to heal and the very next session I opened a tear in my frenulum that caused me to bleed. Since then I found out of a medical issue known as ""Frenulum breve"" that seems to describe my situation perfectly. So I've been avoiding any kind of stretching of the foreskin because I'm too embarrased and scared to go to the doctor.

Now let's fast forward to today that I see hope for potential sex. As recently it seems I might have found a worthy female specimen for procreation but I'm scared to death at the thought of having sexual intercourse. To further this fear, I tested my frenulum to see if 1. I kept the stamina I fought so hard to achieve (I didn't) and 2. my peepee had fully healed...  it seems it didn't... right now, as I'm writing this, a day prior to my date, the tear is redhot and painfull.

Past few days my gf wasn't feeling great and today she went to see her doctor. I was in the uni when I was having a super casual conversation with her. She was sending me vids of her cat fooling around and joking. Then I asked about the doctor visit and she told me casually that she has herpes on her back. It is important that in our language herpes is written and spelled exactly like it is in English, except different alphabets.

Now here's the funny part: I don't know anything about health, diseases etc except allergy (cuz I am very allergic) and bronchial asthma (cuz I have a higher than average chance to develop it). Naturaly I don't know wtf is herpes. Girlfriend knows that I don't know anything about it and thus doesn't specify anything else. So during the 2 hour gap between the classes I start doing my research using google. To my shock I find out that herpes on the back is caused by HSV2. I learn a lot more about it but most importantly that it is an STD and it is very asymptomatic.As we've been in a long term relationship I had no reason to think that she cheated. After I think I fully understand her health state I write her ""baby, don't you ever think that I'll leave you because of this &lt;3"".

Everyone in this fucking world would see that as a very cute thing to say. It shows your dedication, the fact that you're in love with the girl and you want to live with her your entire life.

Was at work, had to run to the restroom to take a dump. My pathetic workplace has about two stalls every floor. It's a regular event for us to go up and down floors to get a stall to shit. Anyway, I climbed up two floors, there were no stalls free in both of them. Took the elevator pressed a random button got to a floor that had a stall free 

Locked the door, took the phone out and unlocked (cuz that's part of the ritual) pulled the pants down and started the biz. Heart and hands were still pumping from all the running, the phone slipped, fell down, jumped twice and rightly landed in the next busy stall, close to the guy's shoes. 

The next 5 seconds were long and awkward. The phone was showing Reddit to the man doing his job. It would be blasphemous to talk across stalls. I just kept quiet, I even considered abandoning the phone. Shout out to the Noble stall neighbor, who promptly kicked the phone to my side. I picked it up, cleaned my ass, ran without thanking or making a noise. You have all my respects Sir.


Tldr: ran to take a shit, slipped phone, fell into the next stall, awkward silence, the neighbor kicked it back to me.",TIFU by tossing my phone to the next stall - Maybe NSFW
31,tifu,"Obligatory this happened on the weekend.

I’ve had the same group of friends for years, and at times we are a little too comfortable with each other. A running joke amongst us is threatening each other with homosexual actions in retaliation for statements an other one of us has made. Some commonplace phrases are “Keep talking shit and watch me lay one on you” or “If you don’t shut your mouth right now I’ll kiss you bro”.

It might be a little weird. Ok maybe it is. But it’s been happening for so long I don’t even think twice about dishing them out or receiving. Thankfully no slips have happened outside the group so far.

Anywho, I digress. My girlfriends best friend has been getting over the end of a long relationship and has been having a tough time with it. My girlfriend decided to go out to dinner with her, and while I’m not that close with her she wanted me to come along. As the night progressed we were laughing, and at one point my girlfriends friend was mocking the way I say bagel. 

At this time, the obvious subconscious response was to stare her dead in the eyes and say in a flat tone “If you don’t shut the fuck up right now I will kiss you”. 

And then I laughed, waiting for theirs to follow, but they never came. Instead, I look up to blank stares, followed by my girlfriend saying “what the fuck?”.

The recovery was sloppy. I just kept saying sorry and I didn’t mean to but neither seemed impressed with it. At this point I quickly explained it’s something my friends do and eventually... there was hesitant laughter. 

I got made fun of for the remainder of the night, thankfully no more aggressive sexual phrases were uttered.

TL;DR: In guy friend group we often angrily tell each other we will kiss one another as a joke, accidentally said same to girlfriends best friend who is recovering from breakup, awkwardness ensued.","TIFU by accidentally telling my girlfriends best friend I was going to kiss her, in front of my girlfriend."

As a result, I created a sexual Snapchat. Something anonymous where I can sext with random strangers. People I find through recommendations or places like r/dirtysnapchat. 

One of the girls who I added was called Tiffany. She sent me a picture and she was kinda hot. She said her premium snap was $10, so it seemed like a steal. I sent the money. 

She then sent me some more photos and said if I paid $20 extra, we can do sexting calls. I felt it was a scam, but I was like “fuck it. Why not. I’m depressed and horny.” 

So I sent the money, and she stopped replying. 

Turns out she blocked me. Took the money and ran.

I forgot to close the door to my apartment as I got home and immediately began my process of getting in the shower since I work in a dirty industry (I’m a welder). My upstairs neighbors have been locking their dog in the storage closet on the balcony of their apartment, well today was the day the police investigate the complaints. They have an agreement with the apartment complex that if they see an open door they legally have to investigate. You can guess where this is going, they think the dog is in our apartment and so they knock on my door and get no response but the door moves as they knock so they now have to come in and check it out. I have barely started my shower when I hear police yelling at me from my room, they order me out of my shower while I only have a towel to cover myself. After the whole situation is discussed, the officers and I share an awkward laugh and they leave my apartment with me still needing to finish my shower.

34,tifu,"I got off early from work and planned on going to the hair salon, get myself a nice haircut to prepare for an event I have coming up over the weekend. But sadly, my day ended on a sour note and me dying on the inside and entirely regretting my decision. 

I called my usual hair dresser but unfortunately they were so busy and since I called last minute, they can’t see me until Saturday morning!! I still said Yes and booked the appointment anyways. I have long hair and haven’t been to the hairdresser in a while  and have mad anxiety about them butchering my hair  so I have just been putting off going. But this was long overdue and my hair was getting out of hand and my husband kept on complaining that I was shedding like a husky all over the house. 

I wanted to get this done today so I went to the same place where my husband gets his hair done. 
I have been there before so I figured I’ll get a haircut and just have it styled and colored on Saturday with my hair dresser, I was very specific with my instructions that I wanted my hair to be shoulder length after the haircut so that means cutting maybe 3-4 inches?? 5 At most. 

The lady who did my hair, I’m not sure if she was angry with life, with me I didn’t know what her deal was, she ended up chopping almost all of my hair!!! 

The first cut, she gathered my hair together from the back ,as if putting it on a ponytail and then I heard 
SNIP!  SNIP ! SNIP!  
I didn’t think much of it since I already told her what I wanted her to do,  and TRUSTED that she will make it happen, after all It was an easy shoulder length hair cut. That was why I was so surprised when I look in the mirror and saw that she had cut my hair too short!!! I was soo mortified!! 😑😑😑 But It was already too late!!  All I saw was the pile of maybe 7 or 8 inches of my hair on her hand. My heart sank. And also I knew I wouldn’t get the haircut that I wanted. 
What am I to do?? Ask her to glue them back on??? 
I am now left with shorter hair than I intended. I am so upset with how she did my hair that I didn’t say anything. I almost cried but just stopped myself. 
The lady thought she did a good job and even said ‘Very nice eh??!!’ 

I just smiled, paid my $17 and left in a hurry. But deep inside I was crying. 😭😭😭 

Sorry for my very stupid story, I know there are more serious problems out in the world. just needed a space to share this and rant.

Our story begins on a Friday night after I get off work. My friend and I do hosting/bussing at a restaurant, and it died down about 10:30 so we were both cut at the same time. We got some food and ate at our job, and I asked him what his plans were after work. He had nothing to do, so I asked if he wanted to come with me to this adult store up the street because I’d been planning on buying some goodies for me and my partner for a while now, and since we’d both recently turned 18 it was time to put those brand spankin’ new ID’s to good use. It was about 11:15 by the time we wrapped up dinner. 

My friend said yes, so we both loaded up in my car and began our voyage to the store. When we finally arrive, we can’t see inside the store at all because we parked between the store and the street, and you can’t have a bunch of kinky stuff facing the main road. So, because of this, the glass is blocked off and we can’t see who’s inside at all. We get out of my car, and a quick glance through the door shows there are about 2 other people there. I didn’t pay enough attention or look them in the eyes... who wants to look at the weirdos in a sex shop at 11:15 at night, anyways? I do look at the lady behind the counter who asks for IDs, so I grab for my wallet while my friend jerks to a halt right beside me. 

“Holy shit.” He says. 

“What?” Me, still fumbling for an ID.

“Is that your dad?”

Now, as a freshly 18 year old kid in a sex shop, that is probably the douchiest thing to scare someone with. I chuckle, and look up from my wallet to see who he’s talking about because he HAS to be joking. 

He was not joking. 

I have never in my life seen a grown man look more ashamed. We both froze there. When people say “I was like a deer in headlights,” I know can sympathize with that exact feeling. His face turned bright red, and I told him simply that,

“Uh.. whenever... you’re done. Just leave.” 

He for sure didn’t look me in the eyes for 2 days. We have a super strong relationship so I wasn’t gonna get booted out or anything... just so fuckin awkward.

36,tifu,"So lately I have been extremely tired and a bit sleep deprived due to working, raising my kids and going to nursing school. I haven't been great about keeping up with household things like putting clean laundry away. I try to use my time more productively since Im always on the go, so it lays in the recliner in my room waiting to be worn.

Yesterday I had to go work my shift at the hospital on a long term care unit. Im a CNA there and it's a stressful job in itself even when we are not short staffed, and we are always shirt staffed. So I woke up in a rush and grabbed my things and a quick change of clothes since Id be heading straight to nursing class right after my shift ended. 

Skip to the end of my extremely long shift (which involved me tripping and faceplanting in front of a state survey person) and it was time to do what I do best and clock out. I decided to change into my street clothes at this point. I didn't really want to use the bathroom on my unit to change since it's small and cramped. I decided to ask one of my residents that wasn't in their room if I could change in her room and she agreed. I thanked her changed and headed off to class.
 
Three hours into class and I hear my phone vibration going crazy. I pick it up and see messages from two coworkers and missed calls. I open the messages and see a picture of a very familiar pink thong and black panties. OMG shit. I panic. I read another message and the only male coworker of mine found some panties in my residents room on the bathroom shelf. I'm trying to figure out how the hell my panties ended up at work in my residents room...Then I remember that damn clothes pile sitting in my chair. 

I decided I needed to go do the walk of shame and retrieve my pink panties from the shelf in this residents room.  In order to leave class though I had to explain to my instructor what happened. Once I got out what happened she burst into hysterical laughter and let me leave to get them. (Not without asking me if the purple panties left in the hall two months ago were mine.) Luckily they were right where I had ""left"" them and I was able to escape without to much hassle, just a few more jokes and cracks and my expense.

37,tifu,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but rather many, many years ago when I was a child.

My family used to go camping every single summer for weeks at a time. We stayed in a camper trailer that was beige with an orange stripe around the side.

I used to be terrified of campgrounds at night. Whether it was the dark or the being surrounded by woods/animals, something about it struck my soul with terror.

Every night, my siblings and I would walk with flashlights down the path to the outhouse to use the washroom before bed. Once we were finished, we would run back to the campsite and often wouldn't wait for one another.

Here's where the FU happened. Like always we walked to the outhouse and like always my siblings abandoned ship the moment they were done leaving me to get back on my own (and this time, THEY TOOK THE FLASHLIGHT). I started to tear down the path fueled by fear with my soul objection to get the hell back to the safety of my parents and our camper.

For WHATEVER reason, when I came to the ONLY split in the road, despite always turning right to get to our site, I went left.

Now of course I'm sprinting like hell and it's dark. I'm borderline having a panic attack because dark spooky woods reasons and FINALLY I see a camper trailer that's beige with an orange stripe on it.

I practically rip off the door and barge into ""my camper trailer"" with a massive sigh of relief. I look to my left where I expect to see my family getting ready for bed and instead see a middle aged couple sitting very erect and very surprised in their bed, flabbergasted as to who the hell just entered their trailer.

Without hesitation, I burst BACK outside and managed to run back to the outhouse, crying the whole time, where my mom had come looking for me, probably wondering if I fell down the toilet.

Needless to say they didn't let me go alone the rest of the trip.

Well it was 1am and i had to go pee, so i grab my phone and walk to the porta potty to pee. On the way back i was watching a youtube video on my phone, not paying attention. I opened the tent door,(tent was pitch black) opened the curtain to my right, because that was my room, got to my bed. And i saw there was an object on the bed. I thought it was my pillow. So i decided to move it. I reach down, grab the object, and it was a DUDES LEG. In my mind i thought “alright who’s messing with me? Who waited for me to leave before they came to mess with me?” Then the guy woke up. And in my mind, it clicked! I realized “Oh no....... I’m in the wrong tent!” I told the guy “I’m soooo sorry, I’m in the wrong tent, this is awkward!” And walked out. Found MY tent, and funally went to bed!

I’ve been under a ton of stress lately. I was recently put on antidepressants for anxiety and depression. A couple of months ago I told my wife to just sell everything I owned that had had to do with my hobbies: cookbooks, vinyl records, etc.

A week or so ago I asked her to please leave the “Bone: Out from Boneville” Collection I had bought when we were dating. She said okay.

So tonight I go downstairs and see that they’re missing. I ask her about them and she tells me that she had sold them two days before I said anything about it. I yelled out “GODDAMMIT” and “MOTHER FUCKER” and REALLY?!?!” I didn’t yell those things at her or call her any names. I just yelled them out of anger (the kids were not home). I asked her how much she sold them for and she said $50 (they cost $10 a piece to purchase the books back) and honestly I knew better than to ask that question and that the answer would definitely piss me off, but I was enraged). But I came upstairs and didn’t say anything else about it.

Eventually I apologized but she said that I made her feel stupid and that she didn’t want to talk to me anymore tonight. 

Now in my defense, I had bought these 15 years ago from a bookstore that our apartment was over top of. One evening I’d sat down and grabbed one of those to read and wound up reading all of them over a few days. I decided that I wanted to be able to share them with our kids when we had them. I wasn’t making much money back then and when I finally got a good job one of the first “extras” I bought myself was this silly book set.  I’ve held onto them and kept them in great condition for all of these years so that when our kids were old enough I could share them with them and they could be the ones to put the wear and tear on them. But to her they were just some books on a shelf. And to think that someone on Mercari got them for half of what I bought them for just sucks and even though I know it’s just stuff, I’m still really irked by it.

I shouldn’t have gotten as mad as I did and I shouldn’t have yelled at all. So tonight it looks like I’ll be sleeping on the couch.

I work as a robotic engineer/programmer and have been designing a fixture to load/ unload the customers part onto. Presented them the design which they approved with the exception of they were concerned about the part binding with the side of the fixture surface as they have had that problem in the past. 

Not a problem its a small change to make but I decided to use this as a learning oppertunity for future me since I do not really know a whole lot about binding and figured I could read up on it and create better designs in the future. 

So I open up my trusty search engine on my computer at work and start looking up ways to prevent binding. Lots of results came back about saw blades binding so I changed up my search to hopefully get the results I was looking for. 

The new search results are where the fuck up occurs. My new results seemed to be much more on topic for what i was looking for and one of them talked about the best techniques for large chest binding. In my working brain I thought that would be useful because a chest would use a similar opening and closing style that my fixture would use. 

Upon clicking the link I was presented with a pairof very large female chests bound in rope and a whole website dedicated to the best bondage techniques for that area. Closed out of everything immediately sat at my desk in disbelief that I could of been so naive for a couple of minutes and went to tell my boss so that he had a heads if anyone asked questions.

It was in december and probably the right time to thank them for the biz that year but also a good time to get snow and traffic issues. To avoid that, my sales booked the flight and the hotel. She chose one in Schipol just to make sure we could fly back easily early in the morning.

On the day of the event, we worked all day, took a plane and hit the town and bars asap as it was starting to be late and some snowflakes were turning up. The night was memorable: great food, beers, wine, cocktails... u name it (no drugs, don’t do drugs bro)

This is not my story but my Uncles, it will be told in is POV.  

This story happened a couple of years ago. 
I was having brunch with my family, my Daughter, Son and Wife. On the menu was Mash potatoes, sausages, bacon. All that classic brunch food. 

I decided to add some ketchup to my mash potatoes. The bottle of ketchup was getting empty so I took the lid off of the bottle and smacked the bottle onto the Mash Potatoes. 

I mixed in all of the Ketchup into the mash potatoes. I saw little off white lumps in it but I thought it was just some potato that wasn’t mashed properly. 

I took a bite of my potatoes and it tasted a bit funky. I looked closer at the mashed potatoes and ketchup clumps, and saw some small wiggly movements. 

I picked one of the little wiggly mash potato pieces up and it was a maggot. I had just eaten maggots. I instantly ran out to go throw up and thought about what had happened more closely.

46,tifu,"After calming down and laughing about this moment with friends, I think it’s time to share this story. This occurred in early December.

A month ago I ran into financial hardship as I am currently a university student , and I signed up for a site that allows men with money to pay for women to go on dates, an escort site. When I first signed up for this, I was very hesitant as there are so many weirdos out there and safety is always number one priority. I eventually began messaging an older man, around his 60s. We had a causal conversation on the site and I asked why he would be on a site like this. He informed me that his wife passed away a year ago and he really only wanted someone to talk to and go out with. Whenever you hear something like this, you are always suspicious.. When you feel sympathy for someone, you open up more and feel comfortable towards them. I then asked if he had social media, as that always gives a personal look into someone’s life to see if they are honest about who they are. He then linked me his Facebook.

When I clicked his page, I guess he was telling the truth about his wife, and I noticed we even had some mutual friends. This was not surprising as he works in the same field as I am majoring in, and it’s a very niche space. I clicked on his wife’s page, and it was an obituary page filled with pictures of loved ones, heart felt messages, etc. After confirming that he was being honest, I decided that I was willing to go out with him. We arranged a date shortly after, and he agreed to pay upfront for the service which was surprising. 

This was my first time ever doing something like this, and we decided to do dinner in a downtown area and to a walk around a local park. I live in the southern United States, so the temperature is fairy nice in early December and a lot of people are out and about during night. I felt safe knowing this and that we decided to meet at the restaurant. 

When the day finally came, I wore conservative clothing as I did not want to give any implications of having anything sexual and to let him know this date was simply platonic. We met at the restaurant at around 7ish, and it was awkward at first due to the age difference being about 40 years, but due to having a lot in common career wise, it was easy to talk about his work and my schooling. We were at dinner for about an hour til we decided to do a lap around the park which was down the street. The park is very lovely in early December as it is lit up with Christmas lights and decorations. There’s a section of the park with a Christmas tree that is a very popular spot for a picture op. While walking by the tree, he waved at someone to take a picture. I was very hesitant about this, but reluctantly didn’t oppose. He wrapped his arm around my waste, and I was a little creeped out, but I smiled and they took the picture. We ended our walk shortly after and headed our separate ways. Although the date did not go poorly, I just felt uneasy about the whole situation. He messaged me a few times after about setting another date, but I didn’t respond and erased my account on the site.

Now this is where the story takes a turn... 

During the week of Christmas, I received a Facebook message from one of my mentors who I had an internship with the prior summer. It was a jpeg file with the caption “is this you with *date’s name*”. My heart sank... When I opened the file, it was a Christmas card saying “Happy Holidays” with the picture we took in the park. I was mortified.... despite anyway I could try to spin it, it would look bad regardless. I just closed out of messenger and erased Facebook off of my phone.. I tend to run away from my problems instead of addressing them... I still feel uneasy about the amount of people who have this picture on their fridge or who received it... 

tldr: Signed up for an escort site and arranged a date with an older man in his 60s that works in the same field I am majoring in. Went on one date with him, and near the end he wanted to take a photo near a Christmas tree display. He ended up using this photo for his Christmas card, which was then sent to a mentor of mine during an internship I had previously.",TIFU by signing up for an escort service

So I started using her towel for my head. I can accept her ass/vag particles on my face since I already have my face down there regularly, but I just can’t accept my own for some reason (y am I like this).

She was on her period today though, and she must have not noticed a blob of blood got on the towel because she hung it back up (probably an easy mistake as our towels are dark purple). I did not notice the spot either until I was wiping my nose and I felt something gooey run across it. I made sure my nose wasn’t bleeding, but I didn’t need to because I deep down I knew what I had just done. I think I’m going to take back the chore of washing towels so she doesn’t notice how many I go through. 

TLDR: I’ve been secretly using my wife’s towel to dry my head off after I shower, she was on her period today and must have not noticed blood got on the towel, but I sure did when I smeared it across my nose.",TIFU by using my wife’s towel.
48,tifu,"So today's the 2nd day back at my uni. I was waitlisted for a class but I didn't expect to get added since it's a core requirement for my major. The night before I looked over at my class schedule and it didn't show up.

I decided to sleep into the afternoon because I took allergy meds the night before and I was still groggy as hell. By the time I woke up it was already 1:15 pm. 

I took my sweet ass time driving to school, arrived at 1:45 because LA traffic sucks, and went to treat myself to some Starbucks. 

While waiting in line, I was on my phone to look over my weekly schedule for my classes and lo and behold, I was added to the class that started at 1:25 pm. It was already 2pm. Fuck. 

I already paid for my drink but I ended up leaving it behind because I was already late :/ i ran for my life like an anime character that got bread in their mouth. My dumbass somehow lost balance while opening the door and made my grand appearance. I entered with a billion pair of eyes staring at me while I stood off to the side cause there weren't any seats left. Luckily the professor was nice enough to not drop me and told me not to be late again.

This is also currently going on, and nothing is okay at the moment. 

So the cast is: 

Rosa: one of my (now former) friends 

Romeo: another one of my friends, is hooking up with Rosa 

Marie: my (likely now ex) girlfriend 

Okay, now that that's out of the way. To start the story. It's about three days ago, Sunday evening. I'm driving Rosa and Romeo home from a weekend experience camp. The camp is about 2-3 hours away, and we all live in the same general area. As I'm driving, Rosa starts going down on Romeo. Of course, being the friend that I am, I ask them to put a blanket over them and be quiet. I turn up my music, and we drive home. 

I drop Romeo off first, and then Rosa. Fast forward to today, where I start texting Romeo. We're joking around, and I go ""at but did she send you any pics, lemme see lmaooooo"". I thought he knew I was joking, but he apparently did not. He then told Rosa, who told my girlfriend that I was cheating on her, with ""numerous"" girls. Mind you, I had never done anything of the sort. I was also unable to defend myself at all, as I was working, and we don't get any service in the kitchen.

I wanted to see if I could figure out how long it would take to ship (start of the fuck up) and forgot to select the right shirt size. I let it to the standard small when I needed a medium. Me, being only 15, of course had my mom helping me get everything set up. My mom isn’t very good with stuff on the internet so she was pissed the whole time because the website wasn’t working super great. I couldn’t even remember if I had selected the right size, but she didn’t even ask me before buying it, just bought it and asked me afterward.

51,tifu,"I hadn't seen my friends in MONTHS because I'm hustling work and school right now (almost done, yay!), and I got invited to a ""boys night"" at my friends house (let's call him J). For relavant background: we're all pretty involved in politics in one way or another [from working in campaigns to just being really into watching political news] and we're a pretty good mix of liberal, independent, and moderately conservative. We're all pretty aware of whats going on in the US and who's who in our government. We get into pretty intense, complicated debates sometimes but we're all still friends either way. 

It was a pretty typical get drunk, hang out, play video games kind of night. We all got hella fucked up on various whatever the hell kind of jungle juice J's roommate mixed. 

At one point 8 of us were doing a psuedo smash brothers melee tournament, and since I was drunk and suck at that game in the first place, I kept getting knocked off by J. Finally he killed me and I got *pissed* so I screamed 

**""FUCK YOU, MNUCHIN.""**

Everyone was super confused so I said ""Guys, yeah, this fucker looks EXACTLY like Steve Mnuchin. Look it up."" 

Here's the thing. I wasn't kidding. Take the guy and make him about 20 years younger and they look *exactly* the same. Its horrifyingly uncanny. So all of my friends google imaged and started *dying*. J is a nice guy but he doesn't handle any criticism well, so he started protesting but everyone just got louder. For the rest of the tournament everytime he was winning, the guys who weren't playing kept chanting ""STEVE! STEVE! STEVE! STEVE!"" until finally, J got really upset (emotional drunk too) and locked himself in the bathroom and started *crying.* I didn't even realize it until someone went over there and knocked on the door asking if he was okay, and he just came out and *glared* at everybody. 

""Don't. Call. Me. Steven. Fucking. Mnuchin. Again."" 

We all apologized and I felt really bad about it. Thankfully he drank some more and basically forgot about it for the rest of the night... hopefully it'll stay that way.

My mom had decided she wanted to bake a pie one day, so she bought the pre-made pie crust, and the instant pudding mix. Then nothing. The ingredients sat in out cupboard for a month.

One on my chores was to take the trash out, so when I opened the lid to change the kitchen bag, i saw the crust and mix sitting on top of the garbage. I saw the pie crust expired that day, and the pudding mix was good for another week or so. They didn't look dirty at all, so in my best George Costanza impression, I took them, and put them in my room. 

After dinner that night, I watched tv in my room, and enjoyed my ""Garbage"" snacks, eating the pie crust, and then just eating the pudding mix straight from the box. Honestly, it was pretty good. Well my mom decided that she would clean my room that weekend, and she found the garbage in my room. She confronted me, and I told her the truth. She said that there was no way I was that stupid, and must be on some sort of drugs. I've never touched the stuff, but she didn't believe me. So she made an appointment with my doctor, and made me do multiple blood/ Urine tests because she was convinced that I was on something. Tests came back clean, turns out I was just fat and stupid...

My parents were gone for the day today, helping my brother move back into his college dorm. I have recently joined the sink pissing community as it saves a lot of water (don’t judge please). I decided that I wanted to pee in the master bedroom of sinks; the KITCHEN SINK. I whipped out my dong, and started pissing down the drain. Midway through I noticed that the sink must’ve been clogged as my piss was filling it up, so mid-pee I turn on the garbage disposal. This was a major fuck up as I instantly felt a volt go through me pee to my penis. I passed out and awoke a few seconds later to find myself half naked and covered in piss. The smell was utterly disgusting and caused me to gag. I would’ve laid there another few seconds if it weren’t for the loud noise the disposal still on. As I stood up, the front door slammed open. Within seconds my mom and my dad came into the kitchen to grab my brothers jacket he must’ve forgotten. The sheer horror on their faces is gonna traumatize me for life. Not only did they see their son with his dong out, but also reeking of pee. They quickly turned away and ran out the door. They haven’t came back yet, and I don’t know what to do. PLEASE HELP.

54,tifu,"I met my boyfriend through Bumble (Sept 2019) last year and initially was just looking for a reserved hook up. I was not into the whole hook-up-through-dating-apps scene anymore but just wanted to keep someone interested should the need arises. We hit it off though and started going out properly November 2019.

Today, my boyfriend sent me a screenshot of his phone screen with the intention of showing his low cellular signal. Lo and behold, I saw that I was logged in his phone as an address (ex. Lower Manhattan) instead of a name.

So naturally, I threw a fit. I accused him of not quitting Bumble and had hundreds of girls in his contacts with just the address as name. I was going full psycho mode and was just literally fuming with the disrespect.

When everything calmed down though, he made a show of changing my name on his phone and then out of curiosity, asked what his name was. He was contemplating whether to put just my name or our pet names with each other in his phone. I said, oh your name is ""JB"". And he was like, oh I don't really go by JB, it's just initials so I prefer if you put my first name instead.

And that's when I realised I don't actually know his name. I don't know what J is for, much more what the B was and his surname. I ended up confessing the whole thing and another fight ensued because of how much crap I had thrown at him, when at least, he knew my actual name. We are friends on Insta but haven't bothered adding each other on Facebook although come to think of it, we did message each other there.

I think we're not going to last long.

I don't care so much about mice but I chased it into a clothes waredrobe and closed the door. I went back to sleep as I was so tired, but I obviously thought of releasing the mouse in the morning so when the morning came I opened the wardrobe. But it wasn't there so I didin't think more about it, thought it had run away. Some week later and I noticed a weird smell in my waredrobe. I had forgotten about the mouse so I thought I didn't wash my clothes properly. It was weird because a lot of my clothes smelled weird. So I took a pile of it and threw it in the laundry machine and washed it. When it was done I took out the clothes and down dropped a dead mouse. I was horrified. Now, before I get arrested for animal abuse, I think it must have died much earlier in my waredrobe and died on my clothes, so I didin't wash a living animal.

Back when smart phones were becoming a thing I bought the Motorola Flip (it was all about being easy to post pics and vids to Facebook with half the hassle.  It was a crappy phone, but it did it’s job, that’s for damn sure. 

It was a Saturday night and I’m a chef so I’m balls deep in dinner rush. I feel my phone going off in my pocket for about 30 minutes straight but I can’t answer it as we are in the middle of a busy dinner shift.  Then, the hostess comes back and hands me the restaurant phone and says it’s my GF. Wtf?

I say “Hello?”  And all I hear is sobbing. I’m irritated at this point and say “I’m busy I’ll call you back” and hang up. Pass the phone back to hostess and keep working. Hostess doesn’t even make it out of the kitchen when she calls back. She hands the phone back to me and I say “what?!” And my GF says through sobs “th-there’s a v-video you posted on f-facebook of us HAVING SEX”. 

Oh fuck. 

I tell my chef I’m sorry I gotta step out and run outside to open my phone to 20-30 texts and calls from different people asking if I meant to post it, wtf I was doing, and congratulating me. I go to  delete the video and it’s got like 17 likes a bunch of comments. 

I then get another call from a number I don’t know and answer it. It’s my GF’s dad. He’s madder than a hornet, understandably.  He tells me he’s heading to my work right now and he’s “gonna beat me to a pulp”.  I call my girl back, explain it was an accident and apologize and ask her to not sick her crazy father on me. I go in and ask my chef if I can leave because of some personal shit and he says “yeah” and I jet before pops gets there (which apparently he did come). 

Girl and I worked it out that night and dated for a couple more months but I never saw her parents or siblings again, which is a good thing. Man, I hated that phone.

57,tifu,"So, the last 24 has been a real change up from the boring life I'm used to..
Either way it all started when I rolled up a little m-cigarette before dinner last evening. As I came back to my apartment I started to have intense anxiety and kinda panicked since I had an unpleasant and heavy feeling in my scrotum for a couple of hours beforehand. 
As I went in the shower it all got worse and I started to have kind of psychotic symptoms, and as I forgot how to use a towel in the panic, that added to even more anxiety and panic. 
Anyways, I had intense panic and etc for a couple of hours before I finally felt calm and fell asleep really fast.

Fast forward to the day after and I had no anxiety or whatsoever and thought to myself ""jeez, I really was fu**ed Up last night, but I should really go check up my nuts""
So I did, and went to the local doc. After telling what I was experiencing in my lower parts I got to see a female doctor. She told me to pull down my pants and underpants, and to lay down on the bed. 
When I lied down she told med to stay calm even though it may be really uncomfortable, and I thought nothing to it. But then she told me the same thing once more, as I lied and was supposed to put my kneed to my chest(baby position). 
That's when I started to think that it felt weird to say it twice, but hey maybe it's really uncomfortable to be felt down there if there was a lump or something. 
And 2 sec later without any warning she puts two fingers right up the backdoor.. 
As I kinda freaked out I stayed calm and let the doc do what she needed to do, and after checking my stomach she could assure me that it was nothing to worry about. So I pulled up my pants and said something like:
-So are you sure that excludes testicular cancer?
And she replied..:
-Testicular cancer, what are you talking about??

The doctor had somehow got scrotum to be my prostate and (live in Sweden so might be there the problem lied) basically I got two fingers in my a** without reason.
So after my nut got checked she concluded I had infection in my epididymis and not cancer.

So seeing it from the bright side I got my prostate checked, which was healthy. Had apparently hemorrhoids so got prescription for that, and prescription for my nutsack. 


TL ; DR I went to check my nut since I had panicattack last night about it. The doc f:ed up and thought I wanted my prostate checked, so got two fingers up my bum. But I got enlightened about hemorrhoids I was unaware of and a infection in my left epididymis.",TIFU by thinking I had testicular cancer
58,tifu,"So first things first, I'm an addict in recovery and go to groups a couple times a week.

This group is for recovery skills so obviously the subject matter of the group is supposed to reflect the topic.

Well today the counselor wanted to play a movie for us called ""6 Balloons"" but we couldn't find a free version on YouTube and couldn't log onto Netflix for whatever reason.

So my counselor searches for ""recovery-based"" movies on YouTube and we find a few different results that she couldn't pull the trigger on. One of the results notes that it starred 'David Tennant' (who I know and love from the Doctor Who series') and was appropriately titled 'Recovery', so obviously I told her to try that one.

We get about 5 minutes into the video when we all realize that it has literally nothing to do with drugs; it's about a man physically recovering from a brain injury and amnesia after getting hit by a truck.

Well if you don't know anything about this movie, you see David Tennant's man ass about 3 or 4 times within the first 30 minutes, including a scene where his wife is re-teaching him how to dress himself and they're both butt-ass naked on the screen.

Extremely inappropriate for a group recovery session about drug addiction...lol.

So i'm sitting there basically cringing at my movie choice and having a terribly hard time at coming to terms with me being the reason that people are going home tonight with the thought of  David Tennant's ass in their minds.

It was right after that aforementioned scene where it was break time and I got to leave for the night. I tell my counselor to have a good night and we're all walking downstairs to the lobby in complete silence; literally made it feel like an eternity.

I got in my car and couldn't help but feel pretty guilty that instead of people learning about handling their recovery from addiction, they instead got a healthy dose of skinny British man-ass because of me. Lol

So one night we both got off work and we're walking to our cars at the same time as a couple others. I was joking around and laughing about something else, when i decided to ask the girl with large breasts a half serious, half joking question. 

I asked ""so when you run do your boobs hit you in the face"", and laughed. Then walked away completely oblivious to the devastation i had just caused. 

The next day i get to work and a manager pulls me aside. He tells me she hasn't come to work because of what i said. He asks me to write an apology letter. I immediately type one up as the depth of stupidity i have stooped to clicked in my head. I apologize profusely and really just try to convey how sorry and stupid i feel.

In hotel we were staying at there was a wierd room with dorr connecting to other room. So our team met sometimes when we were in hotel. This also happened on one girl's birthday. 

First night it went all normal, but second night we were walking between our rooms. Two girls stole our card for room so we stole them a power bank. Then the girls came to our room and wanted it back. We obviously didn't wa ted to give it back to them.

I was lucky enough to hide one bag of chips in a little fridge under a tv but one of girls threw that bag on floor making all the chips crush. Tu en she tried to open fridge to crush the other bag of chips. I didn't let her do it so she kicked me in my balls. It hurt a lot. I finally had enough of her. I turned her around. I put her down with my leg two times. Then i stopped i heard something break. She firstly felt her pain in nose. But a second later her tooth started hurting her. 

I gave them back their power bank, kicked them out of our room and locked the door. This was the time when i realized what have i done.

We then had a long talk with our teachers. They went later to doctor. There was one doctor jn the town but because i have very ""good"" luck there wasnt any dentists in the town. At this point I knew i was complectly screwed up.

It was like 11 pm. when they came from the doctor. I apologized her ten times but she didn't accepted it. I difnt told this to my parents because i didn't wanted them to rage at me.

Feeling thirsty I asked if there were any drinks around and I was pointed to a cooler full of soda, water, beer and... milk. Being a growing teenager, I eyed my prize and grabbed the bottle of milk from the cooler and chugged it down quickly.

I froze but I had already been seen and couldn't hide my shame so I had to apologize awkwardly and look like an idiot for the rest of the day.

67,tifu,"The title is as bad as it sounds, and I think my life is ruined. Anyway, we went out to eat at a restaurant called Kabuki and I wasn’t feeling very good before, but I didn’t think much of it. When we got in there I immediately felt sick. All the cheering at the chef performers and the overwhelming smell of fish. I started getting nervous.
    We were then situated at a the square bar around the stove where the cooks cooked our dinner and tossed knifes and spatulas. I don’t know why but when they put the scallops on the stove, there it came, the puke. I started feeling hot and saliva filled my mouth, I then said something reluctantly to my family members like “uhh I’m not feel- there it came. As I was trying to talk I clenched my fists and the thought of scallops couldn’t leave my head, and then mid sentence, puke just goes out as I leaned against my chair. “Tsssssssssssssss” Oh shit oh fuck oh god, it took me a second to realize what happened but when I did, I looked up and everyone was saying something and backed away from the table. The chef was yelling something in Japanese to his coworkers as the most horrid smell filled the air. It was a smell I can’t even explain. Almost like a mix of puke and diesel. After then I just ran to the bathroom and when I finished there was cleaning everywhere on our table. Luckily most of the puke didn’t hit the table and mostly the chair and floor. After that I’m sure they just burned the place down, it was a shitty building anyway; used to be home to a burger place. I haven’t received a fine or lawsuit but it doesn’t change the fact that every person in that place won’t ever come back.

So my friend (**D)** has a ""gf"" so we made a group chat in whatsapp and just talk (along side with my other friends) so D has been talking about his gf alot and so on.A while back they ""broke up""

D gets pissed easily so I got kicked from the group chat alot of times. So just so it didnt seem like i was flirting with D's gf we were texting normally. The good guy I was i asked ""so how are you after the break up with D""?? and she replied with ""Broke up?""

69,tifu,"okay so this obviously didn't happen today, but this did happen about two weeks ago.

So little back story, my best friend and I are stupidly close and she told me how she wanted a vibrator so I bought her one for Christmas and told her about it, so she was fully aware of what I was gifting her when we met up for lunch to exchange gifts.

Anyways, my best friend we will call N came and met me at my office for lunch. I work downtown so there are lots of government buildings around me and they'll usually have cafeterias inside. Her and I were looking for a quiet place to eat and exchange gifts because we didn't want people seeing the contents inside hers. So we go to the building across the street from mine for lunch since they have a cafeteria and the food is pretty decent there. So we go inside and I completely forgot that you have to check security before entering the building in general, so we go inside and we both panic and don't want to turn around cause we thought it looked suspicious. We go up to the security guys and they greet us and tell us to put out belongings into a bin so they can run our gifts and purses through and x-ray machine (the kind you'd see at an airport). So N and I give each other this panicked ""oh fuck"" look and put our stuff into the bins to run through the machine, and little did I know N had no idea what an x-ray machine did to our stuff, she didn't know it was able to see EVERYTHING. So N goes first and she's holding the wrapped gift I gave her and she puts it in the bin for the guy to scan, he runs it through the machine and the two guys watching the screens give this puzzled look to each other and N and I hear them say to each other ""What the hell is that?"" and then the other goes ""I don't know, put it through again"" and they call a few others over to take a closer look. Both N and I caught a glimpse of the screen and you could see the vibrator perfectly (it was the kind that looks like a microphone, ladies you'll know what I mean) outline and everything. Her and I go beat red and start giggling as the guys put the gift through again, they both look at the screen again and go ""Ooohhhhhhhh"" and realize what it was and they start giggling to themselves, they go beet red as well and won't even look me in the eye when the guy grabs my bin to scan through. We grab out stuff and the guys are still laughing at us and still can't look us in the eye so we awkwardly scurry to the cafeteria for lunch. Her and I were both mortified over it but also couldn't stop laughing over it, it was safe to say her and I were the laugh of the day for those guys working security.

TL;DR: my best friend and i fucked up by going to a building where we needed to check security and security didn't know what a vibrator looked like on the x-ray machine.

70,tifu,"This just happened.  I am soaked.

I was just driving on the way to pick up my daughter from my dad, who had her for MLK day so I could work.  I was touching my wife’s pussy and she asked if we could stop somewhere for some quicky sex.  

I pulled off at a trailhead and we got in the back of the van on top of our jackets which we had removed because of how hot the sex was sure to be.  At first I was on top, but my wife enjoys coming on top of me so we switched spots and she rode me for just a couple minutes before she came.  After I finished I pulled out and she tried to squeeze the cum out of herself but in fact she peed all over me and my pants, and my jacket.  

Now I am on my way to get my kid from my dad and I am soaked in pee.  My jacket is too wet to wear, and it is fucking freezing out.  The sex was great, at least it’s not my mom I’m about to see.

Only a short one here.

I work at a tech support desk centre and they can be quite flexible with phones and whatnot so I can browse reddit in peace and not feel like I shouldn’t be.

We have a lot of downtime so even managers can be seen on their phones.

So when we get calls, it’s kind of engraved in our minds what we say when we answer the calls.
We generally say something of the lines “good morning, you’re through to ******* technical support desk” etc etc.

So as I was browsing reddit, I saw a meme that had the word ‘testicle’ in it.

As I was answering a call and subconsciously saying the salutation, I was reading the meme and replaced the word ‘technical’ to ‘testicle’.

I looked over to my team leader who’s only 2 seats across to see if she heard. 
She did.

She couldn’t stop laughing but also had a look of “you shouldn’t be using your phone”.

We have a call quality thing here too where our team leaders listen to the calls and give us a rating on how well we did.
I’ll be getting call qualitied on that for sure.

72,tifu,"Today was my (22m) girlfriend’s 29F birthday and naturally we were spending time together at her apartment. We only had a couple hours because she would eventually have to pick up her kids from school.  Eventually one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. Everything was great. We finish and realize that the condom had broke, so we focus on getting cleaned up and we’re both kind of freaking out. So as I try to open the bathroom door it gets stuck because the shower curtain rod had fell and kind of held the door shut. So we’re both naked struggling with the door, eventually it opens and we’re talking about what we will do about the condom breaking. There’s a knock on the door and she gives me a look. It’s her ex, the father of her kids. So we both rush to put clothes on, she grabs all my stuff and hides me in the closet. 

For some clarity, he didn’t know about me and still wanted to be with her. She kept me a secret from him because before she got the apartment a month ago she was still living with him and the process hasn’t been easy for her or the kids which I understand. She comes from Central America and we’re living in the United States. So part of the struggle comes from her upbringing in that because she has kids with him she is expected to stay with him. 

So anyway, I’m in the closet sitting in the dark wondering about how my life got to this point, I hear him enter the bathroom and brush his teeth, and then I hear them talking quietly. They may have been embracing but I’m not sure. The talking stops and after about a minute, the door to the closet opens and he is standing there. I get out of the closet and he invites me to the living room where he points at her and yells “This is my wife!”. I don’t know what to say. They are arguing in Spanish. It varies from him fake crying and him yelling at her and asking her questions. He asks me questions in Spanish and she translates to me, he’s asking questions like: How long have you been seeing each other, is she your girlfriend, do you have sex? When she translates I tell her you could just answer those questions. This goes for a little bit longer, he punches the tv. He then storms into the bedroom and begins digging in every thing. He eventually finds the condom and shows it to us. She goes into the bedroom and he asks me to follow. He looks and touches my neck ( I guess she left marks), and then he approaches her and starts pulling at her clothes trying to pull her shirt up to reveal her chest. I try to pull him off and he shoves me back and eventually we get into a fight. One of his punches ends up hitting my lip, splitting it and knocking out my tooth. Shortly after that we stop fighting and he tells her that she has to come with him. She says no but eventually agrees and as she’s leaving she asks me if I will stay and wait at the apartment. I ask her if she’s really going with him, and she says she has to pick up her kids. So they leave, and I go to clean up my face and realize I need to go to the ER. So that’s where I am. I sent her a text telling her I was going and I haven’t heard back. I have so many questions.

73,tifu,"This happened a few minutes ago, unlike most TIFUs. 
Basically, I purchased a secondhand graphics card that ended up not working properly. It came with the packing list, which had the original owners name on it. 

When I was trying to get the card, I had to register on their website. This is where my TIFU happens. My dumbass decides to register the account in the original owners name. I honestly don’t have a good reason for doing this, except a part of me wanted to just save time.

So next day I call them, and I explain the situation. Basically, they explain how the card was potentially sold, and it was out of warranty, but this person would attempt to push for an exception. He then asked me “why is the name on the receipt the same as your account name” and I explained how I did that to make it simpler. He explained how that was fraud and impersonation, and of course I didn’t even think of this. I apologized, he just told me not to do it and changed the name on my account. He seemed unconvinced/suspicious however.

Hopefully this doesn’t affect him checking the eligibility of my graphics cards repair.

So she starts giving me the tit job (without lube) and idk it just felt great, so she starts going faster and I start thrusting when suddenly I feel imense pain coming from my dick, there's just a tiny hole right on the tip of my foreskin and on a vain, I go to the toilet and try and stop the bleeding,  eventually it stops hurting so much and I put it back in my pants hoping it'll just heal. 

So anyway for the next 5 hours we're out with friends and I eventually get home ( an hour ago) and decide to check if Mr peen is doing good, so I whip it out and see glitter, so I slowly pull the foreskin back and before it even gets halfway down the tip of my dick I feel a horrible pain and put it back in my pants,  so then I wait 25 minutes for the pain to stop, I then play a round of overwatch and hop into bed to write this.

So my boyfriend and me have only been dating a month or so but we decided we'd be willing to try out some new stuff together. I had experience doing butt stuff before whereas he was less experienced but open minded about the whole thing.

Me being overly confident was my first mistake. I decided to get out a buttplug (a relatively small one as well), popped it in and proceeded to tell my boyfriend we'd fuck in the front hole as a warm up for the back entrance. As soon as he pushed his dick into me I felt a pop of ""something"" happening to the buttplug and felt the back to feel the stopper. I couldn't feel it. I panicked and said to my boyfriend please tell me it fell out me and it's on the bed...  Nope it was stuck inside me.

I ended up running to the toilet panicking that I'd have to be one of those people who had to go to A&amp;E for having something stuck up their butt. I managed to have to ""force"" it out (I'm sure we can tell what I'm inferring here) and it still wouldn't budge so I basically had to reach in and managed to fish it out. Wasn't a fun time.

76,tifu,"Oh boy where do I even begin. This happened 6 years ago (age 24) and it took a few months of treatment to have it under control. If you haven’t noticed my username, I am a guy. And yes, male yeast infections are a thing. I think a combination of too much sugary drinks and not being circumcised contributed to its ability to strive and flourish.

You are all probably wondering why or how I could leave a yeast infection untreated for a year. As disturbing as this sounds, scratching/rubbing my penis head/foreskin felt absolutely amazing. It was like having an orgasm that would never reach its peak no matter how long I scratched/rubbed. You know the feeling of taking off tight socks and scratching around your ankles? Imagine that feeling, but on your penis. It was like that but on a whole other level.

I can remember the day the yeast infection started. I used a soap bar (Irish spring) to clean my foreskin and my penis. I think the soap cause some sort of inflammation or threw the balance off, because the next day my penis was red and inflamed. I left my member alone while it healed and that’s when I started to notice white discharge under my foreskin begin to develop.

The next few months were a blur. All I knew was that my penis was itchy, and that it felt amazing to scratch/rub my foreskin. I can not over exaggerate how amazing it felt. It wasn’t sexual, I would be flaccid when I was scratching/rubbing, but it just felt so good. I found my self going to the washroom and going to town to relieve my self of the itchy sensation nearly any chance I got. 

I even started googling “male yeast infection feels good to scratch” but I couldn’t find much. Although I did stumble on a few articles from the female perspective. 

The scratching felt so good and I really believe I was addicted to the feeling. I contemplated getting treatment for it but I decided not too because It just felt that amazing.

This went on for about a year. The yeast infection progressed and thrived. The amount of discharge/yeast that came out was somewhat alarming, maybe a tsp of white cottage cheese. I would clean under my foreskin and a few days later more white discharge would build up. My foreskin also became inflamed and tight, and the skin would crack if I tried pulling my foreskin back. I later learned that this was called phimosis. 

One day while I was scratching/rubbing I noticed that the discharge began having a pinkish color. Upon closer inspection, I could see that my penis was actually bleeding and I could see blood coming out from my skin when I squeezed my head. I knew this wasn’t a good thing because blood meant the possibility for some sort of blood infection. 

That was when I finally decided to start treatment. I first tried home remedy things like putting slices of garlic under my foreskin. That didn’t help much. I bought canesten and tried using that. It worked but then the yeast infection would come back. Eventually I ended up going to the doctors and told him about my yeast infection and the bleeding and he prescribed me an anti-fungal cream.

It took about a month for the yeast infection to finally disappear and then it took a few more months with a steroid cream for my foreskin to return to normal. Because of my yeast infection I stayed away from dating. sex was out of the question because of the phimosis. There are days where I still crave the sensation.

Her dad goes into how that’s not actually his puppy but a look alike his neighbor got, which triggers my girlfriend to say I should paint them one. 

I again recoil “no no that one is plenty great I’m not even sure I could do better than that”

So I'm in my second year of university (law) in Switzerland. Swiss people - especially in the german part - usually are reserved and don't talk to strangers that much.

I have an eye condition called keratoconus, it's currently in the third stage of four. Since it usually doesn't impair my vision that much unless I have to stare at thing that are very far away, I only wear glasses occasionally and no lenses at all.

Now to the main point:

One guy was in my university course last year. Didn't know him too well and only hung out a few times during lunch because he's a friend of my friends. He chose to retake the first year because he didn't pass all the exams.

In October I was in the library almost everyday because I had to study. I kept seeing a dude that looks like the guy just with a shaved head and tattoos. Same height, same body shape etc. So I kept saying hi every time I saw him which was at least like 15 times without getting too close. I think once I even asked him how stuff is going. Also I've seen him cuddling with a girl who most likely was his girlfriend.

Today I went to the library again and I was about to sit down (almost next to him) when I saw him and I said hi. Afterwards I went up to him, actually being close for the first time and I asked him how studying is going and what he's studying. He said fine and pointed towards his book. And then it hit me. That's a course book for master students, no way any bachelor students can actually take that course. I looked at his face and then I saw it wasn't the dude I thought he was. So I said 'fun', went back to my seat and left the room a few minutes later because I felt so awkward and kept studying outside (kinda). I saw him leaving the room later and looked away in distress.

So he probably thinks I'm a creepy bachelor student that was hitting on him all the time and has no friends.

I'm gonna wear my glasses more.

This guy has the tone of voice of a C-Span highlights reel and the tendency to speak his mind about politics whenever prompted. Don’t get me wrong, I love politics and I plan on minoring in the subject but giving a five minute monologue to your sleeping classmates at 10am is hardly a good thing. 

This guy found out via a competition that i am published outside of the school paper. And he badgers me in that Mitch McConnell-esque monotone about what classes I take and how I got my connections to this that and the other thing.

82,tifu,"This fuck up happened last Friday...
Last week I got my very first MacBook. I spent a couple of days getting it set up just how I wanted it but I’m still getting used to it. I’ve been using a chrome book so all of my files are online, stored in google drive. There is one particularly private file that I’ve been working on for awhile that details my deepest sexual desires, explicit fantasies, things I’m interested in exploring, and hard boundaries. I knew it was risky to have this type of info on my google drive so when I realized I could lock notes on my computer I copied and pasted it over there, locked it up tight, and didn’t give it another thought. 
Several hours later I was at a cafe doing some work when I received the details on my graduation from my masters program! I was excited to share it so I took a screenshot of the email and started texting it out. I correctly attached the photo to a few different texts (my mom, cousin, friends) and then the fuck up happened. When I went to message my sister I pasted what I thought was the announcement (why did I think this?!) and automatically hit send. Within seconds I knew I had fucked up. I stood up from my seat in the cafe and basically screamed “No!”. She received a flurry of texts from me: 
Noooooo
No no no 
NO
I’m dying
DELETE
delete delete delete 
Throw you phone in the ocean
Delete everything
I’m crying
Oh my god why am I like this?!

My sister and I are pretty close but the level of explicit content was not something I was ready to share with her. When she texted me back (not that long after but every minute felt like an eternity) she said she just woke up from a nap and that she deleted it without reading it. I’m not sure if she really didn’t read it or if she’s just trying to make me feel better. The document essentially looks like a list of porn tags organized by my comfortability and interest, including things which are hard no’s for me, so even if she just picked out a couple of words they would be wildly out of context....so depending on what key words her brain picked out while glancing at it to delete it she could be scarred for life. 
Of all the people I could have fucked up and sent it to......I suppose this was the least terrible. 

What I didn’t understand at the time was how I could copy something from my computer and paste it on my phone. I get it now but damn. I’ve had an iPhone for years and it had never betrayed me like this before!

85,tifu,"This happened a few years ago. I was in Northern Spain for a couple of weeks, which was lovely. Spent a week hiking with my girlfriend, then she had to go back and I stayed around the Basque country for an extra few days. All I needed to do was to get to Barcelona for my flight out.

Since I was travelling very light and didn't want to pay for a room/bed at peak Barcelona tourist season rates, I hatched what I thought was going to be a great plan. I would take a nice, leisurely late morning bus from Vitoria in the Basque country to Zaragoza, about halfway between Vitoria and Barcelona. It has a gorgeous basilica, some Roman ruins, an Islamic palace, and a few other neat sights. I would see those sights, have a delicious dinner (late, in the Spanish style), and then point myself over to the bus station, where I would take the 1am bus to Barcelona. I'd sleep on the bus, get into town at about 5:30am, and then spend the morning and afternoon traipsing around Barcelona before heading to my flight in the late afternoon.

I'd done some variation of this plan multiple times before, trying to combine sleeping and travel time to maximize how long I'd have to see a place. I'd also been to Barcelona before (a crucial detail), so I knew where the bus station was, where I wanted to go, and what I wanted to do once I got there.

And it all went off without a hitch! Had a fun day in Zaragoza, a great dinner, and bought my ticket for the ""autobus a barcelona."" My Spanish is very, very elementary, but I did manage to ask the lady behind the counter ""de donde salida el autobus a Barcelona?,"" which I believe means ""where does the bus to Barcelona leave from?"" or something like that. She told me ""treinta nueve,"" which I took to mean bay 39. I went there, a bus with ""BARCELONA"" on the front stopped, I gave my ticket to the driver, and fell asleep lying across a few seats in the back.

I woke up a few hours later, as the bus was pulling into the Barcelona bus station. Only, the bus driver announced something about ""Madrid."" Now, again, my Spanish is close to non-existent, so I figured maybe he was talking about people making connections or something. Or maybe we were coming into the ""Madrid"" side of the bus station or something. I had actually been burned before by a train station with the same name as a nearby city (a different TIFU for another day), so I just chalked it up to not understanding the announcement.

Except, this didn't look like the bus station I knew. The streets around it did not look like the neighborhood I was expecting to be in. And there were more than a few mentions of ""Madrid"" in the signs and advertisements I was seeing. I figured that there was some easy explanation for all of these inconsistencies, and there was!

I was in Madrid.

Apparently, the bus pulling into bay ""treinta nueve"" was the bus FROM Barcelona, not TO Barcelona. That bus then went on to Madrid. The lady at the counter was looking at the wrong board. The bus driver didn't notice that my ticket was to Barcelona, not Madrid. The sign on the front of the bus was advertising the Barcelona-to-Madrid line. And I was a little too tired, generally oblivious, and poor at Spanish to really cop what was going on. Plus, I slept the whole bus ride, so I missed any announcements along the way.

I was very lucky, in that the bus driver seemed to recognize that he had made a mistake in letting me on the bus. I suspect that he may have been worried that I'd go to someone else and he'd get in trouble, because he immediately brought me over to his buddy who was driving his bus back to Zaragoza and on to Barcelona. Five hours later, I was back in Zaragoza. At this point, I was freaking out because I was running pretty late for my flight. I didn't have a smartphone with a Spanish SIM and the bus had no Wifi, so I spent five hours not knowing whether or not I would actually be able to get to the airpor ton time. I ended up getting a (pricey) high speed train to the airport, skipping Barcelona entirely, and still had to dash through the airport.

**TLDR; I got on the wrong bus and traded a day of sightseeing and eating in Barcelona for a tour of northeastern Spain's public transit infrastructure. 2/5 would not recommend.**",TIFU and ended up in Madrid when I was supposed to be in Barcelona
86,tifu,"This happened around 16 years ago when I was 8 or 9 years old (yikes wtf where did the time go). Around that time, I wasn’t the most athletic kid. I wouldn’t hit a growth spurt for another couple years or so, and I come from a family of distance runners rather than sprinters. This is important. So I was at a Boy Scout camp out with all my friends who also did scouts. I didn’t like it but it was a way to socialize. One of the days we had an activity not far from the tent site: a BB gun target practice activity. Everything was fine, no one got shot. Perfect, right? After we get done, we run back as fast as we can to get to the cooler full of gatorades. Here’s where being slow sucks ass. Everyone else was faster than me. Maybe I didn’t sprint hard enough. Who knows. I didn’t think it would matter. They got to the cooler way before me. They open it and each take a Gatorade. I get there, and there is only one left. It’s lemon lime, but something is off about it, like the color is different than normal and it’s not translucent whatsoever. But I figure hey, it’s green at least, could be a new formula or something. 

Here is the fuck up.

My fucking genius dad decided to put **A FUCKING MARGARITA** in one of the Gatorade bottles. Yep. He decided to put it **WITH THE REST OF THE GATORADES**. My slow ass got there too late. I didn’t get a pick, I was stuck with the weird one. I wasn’t deterred, so I open it up and drink about half, as I was super thirsty. I quickly realized it tasted really bad, so naturally, I poured it out. The next several hours I don’t remember well, but what I do remember is violently stumbling around a nearby stream before my dad came and grabbed me. Went to sleep at 6 pm, woke up at 2 pm. Stupid hangover. Got on the liquor real early...

87,tifu,"This happened today. I was running late for work this morning and my ride was almost to my place so I was hurrying getting everything ready. I look over at my desk and see my EpiPen and think ""I'm installing duct work today. I'm not gonna run into any shrimp. "" Well after an 11 hour shift my coworker and I decided we were gonna go out to eat. It was my first time at this restaurant so I didn't know what to expect but I saw my favorite side dish on the menu so I ordered it. I went and started going to town on my corn nuggets and after 3 or 4 my throat starts feeling weird. I figure I was just eating too fast and needed to slow down. So I keep eating and eating until I realize something isn't right when I try to talk. I look around and notice the table next to me has fried shrimp. That's when I realized my mistake. The nuggets were fried in the same oil as the shrimp. Then I noticed I didn't have my pens with me so I quickly tell my coworker and ask for my check and pay before going full send to the nearest CVS and get myself some Benadryl. I drunk about half of it on accident just trying to hurry up. Now I'm so out of it that when my coworker tried talking to me, I didn't hear him and when he tapped my arm I jumped and felt the staticky thing in my head.

88,tifu,"This actually happened last week. I'm still cringing at myself so hard! It's WAAAY worse than it sounds in the title.

So, I have this friend, call her A. She's absolutely horrible sometimes, as you'll see, but I love her to death. We've been best friends since 1st grade.

My crush, call him G, is a guy who I haven't had regular contact with in years, since he switched to homeschool. I see him every couple months or so, at like a school event or something, but other than that, I don't see him at all.

Anyway, it was the first day of the new semester, and me and A were in creative writing. We sat down, and out of the blue, A started asking me about what I plan to do about G. I told her I'd kinda given up on pursuing him, since he was never around.

That's when she said ""Oh come on, you're lying to yourself. You'd have so much fun with G. Don't pretend you don't want him to stuff you like a turkey.""

We started giggling like crazy, and so was the girl next to us (Who I'm also kinda friends with). Just as we started to regain our composure, I said ""Yeah, that'd be kinda hot"", and gobbled like a turkey to keep the laugh going. That's when the guy sitting behind us, who was trying to stay quiet, finally broke into laughter. All good fun, but A says with a huge, knowing grin, ""Look who it is!""

The guy sitting behind us was my crush. He had his hand over his mouth trying to hold back the laughter, and his eyes were so wide. I don't think he actually believed that I was talking about him. He came in after us and I didn't notice him. I screamed, and probably said ""No!"" like 100 times in a couple seconds. I had to leave without even saying hi to him, and I cried in the bathroom for a good 20 minutes. Well, I laughed for the first minute or two, but the tears quickly turned sour.

What are the fucking odds? He doesn't even go to my school! Turns out creative writing is open to students who aren't enrolled in the school. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I mustered the courage to actually show my face at the meeting the next day, but we both seem to be taking an approach of pretending it didn't happen. He tried to start a conversation, which I guess is probably a good sign, but I'm not having it right now. I feel way too awkward to interact with him.

I was SOOO mad at A. STILL AM! She knew the whole time and she baited me into it! She's been nice about trying to comfort me afterwards, saying it was her words not mine, but that was a jerk move.

A go to as of late had been wrapping that mini chicken quasadilla extra cheese around a Loco taco, which is amazing. We were going for the spice of the reaper and we couldn't have it. We also love the Nashville hot tendies. (Our T-Bell is a KFC combo). I decided on getting the mini's and wraping those around the tendies with the Nashville on the side so that it could be poured in. Let's just say this in the new go too for me...maybe her if she survives. Greasy spicy KFC sauce poured upon anything T-Bell is golden and dangerous. In addition to her gut-bomb she also got her typical chili-cheese and another greasy tender down. We were happy then.

The flaps, being new, were still stuck down with little bits of paper from when they were cut, and I couldn't pull them up with my finger nails. I asked my 6 year old to bring me a butter knife so I could pry them open. It worked like a charm and we read the book. The next day, 1.5 year old goes to the kitchen and runs back to me carrying a knife. I scold him and take it away, so he goes and gets 3 more. Must have grabbed the wrong one, right? After a few more attempts to bring my husband and I knives, and occasionally his book, I put 2 and 2 together that he thinks a knife is needed to read the book, and that there are other hidden flaps that need opened with a knife for the animals that don't actually have flaps. A month later he's still bringing us butter knives or using them on the book himself. If we lock the silverware drawer, none of the kids could get silverware for meals.

91,tifu,"This story begins when 10y old me was playing around on my bed whit my BB gun’s bullets. I don’t really remember how or why but I dropped a BB in to my earcanal. Ive always hoped it had dropped out of my ear since i slept on that side of my head that night. Turns out it didn’t. Last year when I was 17 I went to the docter for something I don’t remember and he checked my ear. He saw that it was blocked so he asked if he could pull it out right away. I let him go ahead and he tries to grab it with some kind of tweezers. t this point i noticed that he was having trouble so i was starting to worry about that time when i put the BB in my ear. Then i hear a loud scraping noice, I tell the doctor that i might have put a BB in to my ear. The docter tries for a while but it wasn’t working and my ear hurt like hell. (I dont blame him tho, i shouldn’t have let that BB in my ear for to long.) My doctor is a very friendly guy in his 20 and he dicides to get a more experieced older docter for his opinion. The old docter tries too, it hurts even more and he couldn’t get a hold of it either due to the smooth cerface of the plastic BB. They then both go in at the same time with diferent tools. I’ve never felt such pain before. My eardrums are dying but then I can feel the two prong tools having the BB between them when they stab in to the side of my ear. Then it happened. I’d passed out from the pain. When I woke up the old doctor had already left and my regular docter had my legs up to get more blood to my head. I had no idea where I was and panicked because of him holding my legs up. I kick him right in the face and in the chest. I think 3/4 times before I realized where I was. I apologize and asked if he was ok. He said he was fine and that he knew I didn’t mean to. My ear still hurts so I ask him if they got it out. He said yes and showed me the ball in a paper bowl. I was so happy that is was over. My ear was bleeding while I was talking to my doctor and he told me it was normal and that I just had to clean the outside with some cotton swabs and the hardened blood on the inside with some eardrops over the coming weeks. When I start to walk home the bleeding starts to worsen. When I get home I clean it just like he said and it stayed clean for some time but when I wanted to lay down a little since I had passed out about 30 minutes ago I accidentally rol over on my ear that had been bleeding. It started bleeding again but this time it was unmanageable. By the time I got out of the bathroom where I cleaned my ear there would already be new blood flowing down the side of my head. I was like fuck it, I’ll just let it flow. My ear hurt a lot less already at this point and the bleeding just tickled going down my neck. It looked horrible tho. So I send some pictures to my friends to show what trouble I’d gotten myself into. I cleaned it all off before going to sleep and it quickly healed. Now I’m 18 and don’t even remember which ear it was without looking at a picture. I guess I got lucky the BB didn’t do much damage while it was in there.

One of our teacher was absent today. So there was a substitute. She didn't teach us anything so she started a discussion in our class. The topic got changed to one of the best apps. I live in India, so many people use Reddit but none of my classmates. 
So I started telling everyone about Reddit and how it is one of the best apps for memes, and how people immediately help you out if you have any queries. I also told them that it is our responsibility to upvote each and every funny meme and if the username has cake besides it,  and also about awards and stuff. 
Everyone was interested in it and wanted to see how it is. 
So without a second thought I opened my phone and showed them Reddit. 
I usually follow subreddits like darkjokescentral        
darkjokes etc. I was explaining them about subreddits. 
When I opened Reddit there were posts of dark memes about Jews, black people and Hitler. 
Just before I could say anything, I was sent to the dean and my parents were being called and I had to take a class of the college councilor. 
And tomorrow I have an appointment with the therapist.

95,tifu,"Short, sweet, and oh so horrifying. Well, in real time. This retelling is not so short. TL;DR: at the end.

Cue the scene, in my bathroom, this lovely wednesday morning. After just coming off of a night shift, I had one goal in mind: sleep.

Now, wednesdays are the beginning of my weekend, which is a joyous time for celebration. One of the many things I do to celebrate on this day is shave. For context I use an electric razor, and I typically keep my beard grown out. I use one guard for the parts that I want to keep about 2-3 inches in length, and then one for fine detailing.

Perhaps you can already see where this is going.

It's also worth mentioning that I'm 21. This wouldn't be super relevant if it were about any part of me other than my beard.

You see, at 21, I'm in a magical time of my life. It's an uncomfortable period where I either grow my beard out and look 26, or cut it and look 16. There's really no in between, as I reinforced the hard way today. Now, I've grown accustomed over the last couple years to the 26-year-old look. It's just a part of me now. Like a time wizard, I transcend the assumptions of immaturity that most people make about folks my age. This is especially helpful when you see lots of people every day at work, in a position of somewhat authority.

Now we get to the fuck up which we've all seen coming for the last 4 paragraphs.

I begin with my detailing guard, because... well, because I was too tired to care really. I knew I'd have to switch again after shaving the main portion in order to make sure the edges were clean. But I figured may as well take the mustache off, since I can't grow it out enough to break the ""creepy uncle"" barrier. Then I could tackle the rest of it.

So I take off the mustache. Then clean up the pseudo-mutton chops that have grown their way onto my face. Then I begin to work on getting the beard. The faster I get this over with, the faster I sleep.

""Whoa! I must've let my beard get really out of hand this week!"" I say to myself, as I notice how defined the last razor stroke was. I do one more, and think ""wow, this is really a lot of hair. I cant believe it grew so quickly this week!""

But hang on, when did I switch to my beard razor guard?

That's right, I didn't. And I realize this, as I look at the neat patch cut nearly perfectly down to the skin on my chin.

I, of course, did the honorable thing and axed the whole lot instead of trying to pretend I was doing something new and trendy. I didn't need a chin that looked like the top of a friar's head. I certainly did agonize over that decision, though, and in the end I'm back to looking like I'm 16. It'll grow back, one day. I hope.

Oh yeah, and to add insult to injury, because the guard was so short I cut my lip for the first time in months. Pretty decently too. I would've been upset at my own carelessness if it hadn't already cost me so much one tired, tired morning.

96,tifu,"Ok, so I taught him about the idea of spelling words backwards and pronouncing them in their backwards form a few months ago, but the TIFU part actually happened just a few hours ago. Also, changed my son's name for the sake of anonymity.

As I said, I introduced my 5 year old son to the silly idea of pronouncing words backwards a few months ago when I told him that his name spelled backwards was ""Nivek"". He thought this was funny and  he started asking what my name was backwards, what mommy's name was backwards, the kitty's name backwards, and so on. He usually thinks words are pretty funny backwards. Sometimes he recognizes words backwards are actually another word. Because of this he frequently asks me what the word means when he says it backwards. Usually it's just gibberish backwards, but sometimes we find one that's a different word backwards. Like a local grocery chain called Marc's backwards is Scram. Stuff like that.  From time to time he gets in a mood where he starts asking what all kinds of things are backwards: What's Taco Bell backwards? What's snowman backwards? And so on.

So tonight we were finishing up our dinner and he was in a backwards word mood. He was still working on his dinner and I grabbed a pint of ice cream from the freezer for a few bites while he finished up. He asked me what kind of ice cream it was and I told him, then he asked me who makes that type of ice cream to which I replied ""Häagen-Dazs"".

Son: ""Daddy, what's Häagen-Dazs spelled backwards?""

Me, looks at it and tries my best to pronounce it reversed: ""Szad Neggah""

I grimace as I realize how that sounded when I said it.

Son: laughs hysterically ""Sad Negga! Daddy, what's a sad negga?""

Me: ""Uhhh, nothing. Let's not say that one.""

Son: ""Daddy, why can't we say sad negga?""

Me: ""Uh, that's just not a nice word to say.""

He's in bed now and only said it 3 more times after that all night. I'm hoping he forgets it by tomorrow and doesn't go around school saying it. I can just see the note coming home from school with him that my son was saying ""sad negga"" after just coming back from Martin Luther King Day...

97,tifu,"This happened literally 30 minutes ago and my heart hasn’t stopped beating since.

Me and my friend wanted a cool and chill place to study, so we decided to go to the wing of my colleges business school that is currently under construction. Normally the security guards are chillax and don’t really care about kids going there to study, but we’ve only ever been between the hours of 3pm-6pm. The events of this horrible mistake occurred from 6pm-12am.

So we make it to the building by going through some unlocked doors and tunnels that span from the Biology building to the new part of the business school. We make it and set up and the area is nice and calming. Everything is newly constructed. My friend and I find a cool “wellness room” that has some chairs, a fridge, and plenty of outlets — so we set up there. 

It’s about 8pm at this point, and suddenly my friend has the great idea to steal some office supplies from the surrounding area that he can use.

Cue him taking about 7 trips and amassing a pile of random stolen stuff.

He has to continually prop a door open to get to other parts of the building, all while I’m trying to enjoy the impeachment stream innocently. After a few trips he says “yo do you want me to run and get snacks so we can set up and do more work?” I obviously agree and give him my student card to buy some. 

Now ladies and germs, because we didn’t want to leave the doors outside propped open, my friend thought it was a good idea to slip out a window and leave it open so that he can return through it later. This was a BAD idea.

After he’s been gone for a bit, I hear voices outside of my secluded wellness room. I hear doors slamming and walkies blaring and etc. The security guards are making sure everything is locked up.

And here I am, 19 and stupid, with a pile of stolen office supplies frozen solid. 

They get to my door, try it, and move on once they know it’s locked. I breathed the biggest sigh of relief — relief that is instantly taken from me when I hear them reporting that a window was left open and that there may be a robbery because a man was seen exiting the window a while ago.

Fuck.

I start to pack all of my friends shit and mine, being as quiet as I can and texting him frantically for help — he is not very helpful. I end up spending an hour in the room while about three security guards talk about the open window (this is taking place across the hall from the room I am in). I can’t fit everything into his bag and mine, so I end up piling it all into a cabinet and standing there, waiting for the security to make their rounds again. 

Finally they’re gone, and I decide like an idiot to take the elevator up and exit out the front door — two backpacks and a drawstring on my back. I am very clearly not supposed to be there at this time, and my friend is telling me to leave because he has now discovered that they are looking for the second man seen through the window — me. 

I make it to the first floor, exit the elevator, and the exit is in my sights when I hear a voice say “hey whatcha doin here?”

Every part of my body felt like hot salt, and I turned and awkwardly muttered

“me and my friend were just studying downstairs.”
“So there were two of you?” 
“Yes.”

He nods his head and I walk out, hyperventilating and flipping my shit. A few security guards saw me on my walk back, and I heard voices on all of their walkies talking. I finally make it back to my dorm, and then I realize I can’t sign in because I don’t have my student card. 

The front desk lady and RA’s look at me strangely when I enter, as if they had my description already. They ask me my name and room number, check that I live in the dorm, and I leave without another word. 

Now I’m in my room, terrified, and wanting to die. Thanks for reading — this was very soothing to write.

No one else heard me say it, it was just after lunch break and most had left the break room. She went ""oh isnt this allowed?"" She was pissed off, I sensed it but I just had to keep fucking up. I said ""haha Nooo"". She did not laugh. Panicking, I said ""oh you're so cool because you dont care"" she was like no. And then I went ""I'm just kidding, I just noticed because it's such a pretty top"". She said ""ok thank you"". Dagger eyes until I left. I dont know what to do when I see her tomorrow.

We were really excited because I love cooking and had never been to a fancy place like that. As we arrived we decided to get a “Drink Card” where you pay a set amount of Money for unlimited drinks. 
Naturally we started ordering a bottle of wine to enjoy while watching the show and eating good food. Naturally I was getting progressively more drunk and so was my boyfriend. 
We ordered a second bottle, a third, a fourth and eventually a fifth.  By this time I dont have any memories so my boyfriend had to explain to me the next day exactly what I did. 
Apparently I got so drunk I started just puking on the table and into my glass. Obviously in front of all the rich people that where also there just trying to enjoy their food. The sleeve of my dress was covered in vomit and everybody saw while I was walking outside. 

This is an annual thing and before all of this we decided this would be a nice Christmas gift for us next year but I fear I cant be seen there again.

I am  working with my plumber on a bathroom remodel, and needed to send him  details on the fixtures and fittings needed. I had a list of things that  I had taken a photo of.  I wrote up the email on my phone and at the  bottom, inserted the image I needed to send him. I saw the correct  image pop in and then hit send.

Today  I get a response to my email, that simply asked if I could provide him  with the quote number. No mention of my fuck up. I start to scroll down  to look at picture I sent to him, and as I scroll past the correct  picture, I see my wife’s head pop into view. This was a picture we had  taken Friday night. The one next to the image I correctly sent in my  photo album (hadn’t had chance to make hidden yet). I started to panic,  thinking maybe it was just a technology glitch, referencing wrong image  somehow, but I opened up my original email to him, and there my wife  was, pleasuring me.

There was no  way he didn’t see it in the email, but he clearly responded, including  the images, to politely let me know about my fuck up.

I  sent a response back, acknowledging my fuck up and apologized. Kindly  asking him to delete the email. He responded saying he had, and all I  can do is trust that he did.

UPDATE: So I took the advice of a small number of you and sat down with my wife this evening to sheepishly explain what had happened over the weekend. It was only right, since she was in the picture and as much as I’d love to trust my plumbers word, I needed to be honest and open.

When we first sat down, she was having one of those... oh shit... a serious talk moment. I could see the nervousness on her face. I assured her that what I was about to tell her was not as bad as she may be expecting. She asked if she would want to divorce me... I said, hopefully not.

I began to explain the story above about how I had been emailing the plumber, and I could see the confusion building on her face. I said that I had attached a photo, and somehow a second photo had attached. It took her a moment before things clicked. 

First question. Which photo? I grabbed my phone and pulled up the photo in question. There was a little bit of relief on her face. “Well, my face isn’t 100% clear, could be any asian”. To be honest my photography skills are a bit shoddy, but her face was somewhat visible. Luckily, her naked body wasn’t visible. This added to her relief.

As we talked more, she started to laugh a little, mostly at my stupidity. I then said we needed 
to talk about what to do about the plumber. She assumed that I was the one uncomfortable with our plumber now, but I said I was fine, but happy to decline his services if she felt in any way uncomfortable. She said she was ok with the situation, but may try to avoid being around. 

So, looks like we still have a plumber for now.

I even showed her my post here on TIFU, and she was amazed how quickly the story blew up. She even joked that I had sent the wrong picture to the wrong person. She would have preferred if I sent to our roofer instead.

I’m a male 8th grader btw

One lovely day before winter break, we had a fun science class where we did kahoots and had a challenge to see who could make the biggest tower out of clay and toothpicks. We were put into groups of two or three and I was in a group with my best friend (we’ll call him Larry) and a girl. We’ll call her Bob. So we start and we are just making random shapes and stacking them on top of each other. By about quarter of the way through, we had a tower that was about 15cm tall (it was the tallest). We decided to add more shapes onto it. It was really wobbly. By the time we were almost done, it was about 20cm. Bob comes up with the great idea to try and put a little pyramid roof on the top. She makes it, places it on top, and it falls! Larry and I were just like “awwwww” but for some reason, Bob was really angered by this and punched the table in frustration. We don’t really mind it until bob yells “IT’S IN ME!!!” She impaled her hand with a toothpick! Me being the office fanatic I am say “that’s what she said.” Everybody kinda stared at me and Larry was on the floor dying. Little did I know, my teacher (she is my favourite) tells me in front of the whole class, to go to the principals office. Now Larry is about to throw up from laughing so hard, so the teacher sends him down too. As we are waiting for the principal, Larry is still peeing himself laughing. We get called in.

Side note: our principal is literally the biggest boomer I know, so therefore I will refer to her as Mrs. Boomer. 

So we get into her office and she sits us down at her table. She asks us to explain to her what happened so we did. No problem there. But, being the boomer she is, she hasn’t the foggiest idea what the office is or what the joke meant. So I had to go through the pain of explaining the joke. Explaining the sexual part was the most awkward thing I have ever experienced. She lectured us and I thought we were done there. Boy was I wrong. Apparently at my school, making sexual jokes was worth a week of suspension. So I get to stay home for an extra week after winter break. Whoop de do.

Another side note: Bob actually thought it was hilarious and only had a small infection from the clay on the toothpick. Bob is a reeeaallly unlucky girl. In 4th grade she broke her leg really badly she couldn’t walk for like a year. Also she almost died from cancer when she was little and she has always had this really bad cough. And I really really      am not trying to be rude, but she doesn’t look the best either.

Needless to say, I felt really bad.

104,tifu,"This actually happened a couple months ago, but i just recently began using reddit and i feel compelled to share.

I'm a highschool student, and I had an out period, which means I just don't have class and can do whatever. 
My friend and I were laying in the field and they brought up that the science teacher had a pond next to campus. 

The special ed kids have a small building next to the school that the fence around the field does not include. The pond was in the backyard of this.

They said they wanted to check it out because they have their own pond and I don't know, they're just into this kind of stuff. So we walk along the fence looking for a way to get through. I am lazy, and don't want to walk all the way around the fence which would take about 5 minutes. 

This fence is about 6 feet tall, and to be honest I don't have much experience climbing fences. The sharp metal sticking up at the top scares me because I don't want to get cut, so I find a part that has been bendt down, and begin climbing. I get to the top and start struggling because I don't know how to get down without hurting myself. After a bit of stalling, I say fuck it and jump off. 

I land successfully, and feel a sting on my arm, so I look thinking it'll just be a light scratch. I realize I had just cut my arm on the fence, and it's so deep that I can see the fat in my arm. I press my arm to my shirt and start walking around the fence to the nurses office. Funny part is, there was an open gate 15 ft away. 

After waiting for my mom to get home (she was out of town) I go to the hospital and get 13 stitches. Couldn't lift anything or move my arm much for the next week, and had bandages for the next 3 weeks. I haven't been climbing much of anything since then. Sadly, never saw the pond.

Weird question, have you ever used mouthwash to purposely cry. Well I did and I totally shit the bed.

Some backstory: I currently am a freshman in high school taking one of the hardest classes in the county. I’ve been sick for the past three days with just a sore throat. That’s all I need to say here pretty much, now onto the FU.

Coming off of an illness I missed Tuesday of school, which is really great since we had a huge test I didn’t study for, so on Gods wheel of sickness I lucked out for when I got mine. Now after school maybe 7 of my good friends start saying how lucky I am for missing it and how hard it was, so like any rational person who hasn’t studied I just know one thing, I’m fucked. Come 8:15 at night I’ve been working on a paper due the next day and I forget about the test until now, because at this moment 13 hours from now I will be taking the test, so I’m currently in deep shit. Next thing I know, instead of studying I’m looking at wikihow guides on how to fake throw up.(Never try this unless your parents are dumber than the stay-puff marshmallow man) Eventually I chew up some cracker spit it in a bag pour water and get ready. I am gonna put some in my mouth to make me smell bad until I realize it smells like cracker so I grab a can of tuna open it somehow cut my finger and mash some tuna in. I here the garage door open and that’s my queue, and then I remember, I can’t fucking act. I got cut from the school play last year but it was a no-cut activity. So, me being a dumbass decides to use listerine to make me cry as I pour it in my mouth it does a mighty fine job of making you cry but also make your breath smell good, so there I am with chunks of mashed tuna and crackers I’m the toilet and me crying. At first my parents actually somehow buy it. I thought I played the like a fiddle until I FU. You know how I said I couldn’t act, well I start to smile of me being so cocky and my mom gets sus. She smells the area and can just smell raw cracker, then my breath which is minty. This next part I swear to god it looked as if she went all pillar man on me and just stood there, menacingly. She took my phone and now I am going to school tomorrow and she talked to the teacher to not curve the test as a punishment  for me and I hope she doesn’t. So now you know not to trust wikihow

My BF who was 31 and me, who was 24 f  who is 5'2 and looked young at the time. 

We go to a concert and decide to get a room at Motel 6, because we are both very drunk and it's late. We go to check in, and the guy goes through the list.. sign here, show ID, give me a card.. etc. BF gives him his id, cc, and fills out the paperwork. BUT THEN.. the guy looks at me and asks to see my ID. Well this is the first, it's weird, but I'm drunk. So.. my dumb-ass response was.. ""Why do you need to see me ID? Because I'm only 14.."" and literally start laughing hysterically. Didn't think anything of it.. because it was a running joke with my friends. 

We get to our room, and it's RIGHT NEXT TO THE OFFICE. We hate that, because we are drunk and have more beer and wine, and didn't want him to hear us continue to party/ bang.. blah blah. 

My bf goes to the desk and asks for a room further way and we move. We drank, had our fun and fall asleep. 

I'm in happy drunk sleep land, when I wake up to a woman's voice. ""Ma'am.. wake up, you need to wake up, wake up, wake up."" I shoot up, literally half naked to a female cop going through my purse asking me all kinds of questions.  ""what is your name, how old are you, who's the man you're with, are you safe"". 

Long story short .. it took the front desk 2.5 hours to call his manager, relay what happened, and it was decided that I was probably 14.. and he should call the cops. And so he did..  

My BF (who told me after, because I'm a heavy sleeper) woke up to the knocking on the door first, answered the door in just his boxers, to 2 police, a man and woman. The male cop was going to enter, but thankfully BF stopped him, because I was a half naked women, so while he was being questioned by him, the woman came in and woke me up and questioned me. 

After I was dressed and semi drunkenly coherent, the cops chastised me for ""joking about something so serious"" and left.

107,tifu,"A few years ago I went to visit my parents in Mexico. I live in San Diego, and they live in Tijuana, which makes such trip very frequent in my life. Fortunately the drive is short, so I take my car, and so do thousands of other people that live here and have family members in Tijuana. It is also no cliché that in Mexico (and much of the world), soccer is a very important game, and a lot of people watch it. And worth mentioning that the cliché does not apply to me or my family.

On that day a lot of these things would come together in such a way that I would end up handcuffed sitting on a bench at some back office waiting for the police to come.

After I was done visiting my parents on that day, I went back to San Diego as I normally do. It was somewhere in the back of my head that that night the local soccer team (Xolos de Tijuana) would play in the final match of the National championship, but I didn't think much of it, and of course, it didn't even come up with my parents. We had dinner, watched a movie and I left their house and set on my way back to the border crossing.

As I later found out the local team won the match, which prompted a lot of people to drink. A lot of the people that also drive there to see their families probably watched the game and were now drunk, and many of the drunk ones decided to drive back.

Soon I made it to the border. The way it works is like this: You get in line with your car like at the drive-thru, and slowly move towards the crossing, once you reach there are several booths in which a CBP officer is waiting to check your documents and allow passage. This officer happened to have beautiful blue eyes, so I couldn't help myself but, with a clumsy attempt at eloquence, remind her of that. She gave me a long suspicious look, grabbed an orange paper and sent me to secondary inspection. ""Great"" I thought, that'll waste me an hour.

After a few minutes, some officer finally approaches my car, reads the orange paper, and tells me to step out of the vehicle. I do. He jerks my right arm, pushes me against the car and very derisively started what I can only describe as bantering at me about crossing drunk, about how I reek of alcohol, and every time I tried to say something he asked me not to resist. I think he even made me chuckle.

They escort me back to their office without saying much more than I reek of alcohol and explaining to me that this is all standard procedure. At this point I'm already calm and just chatting with them. They take me to some back office, where there's a lot more people whom I didn't need to sniff to know that they did indeed reek of alcohol. Everybody waiting for the police to arrive to do the DUI test and either go home or go downtown.

Not long later, the cop arrives. I had aligned myself to try to be first, and I managed to do it. The cop asks me if I've ever done that before, I said no, so he explains. ""If you didn't drink and you wanna get home fast, just do the blow test."" I do, A second later it comes clean, and they let me go.

On the way back, the same officers escorted me back to my car. I give the bantering officer a petty but proud ""I told you I wasn't drunk."" He did apologize to me and told me he has to say that to everybody.

I never heard of the blue-eyed officer again.

Do you remember the movie 'The Big Lebowski', directed by the Coen Brothers? Well, many years ago, when this movie was still relatively fresh in my memory (I was, and still am, a big fan), I had traveled to the USA. One evening I was hanging out at a bar and playing pool with a couple of locals, when I noticed that one these guys wore a thing on his keychain, very similar to what The Dude was using in The Big Lebowski, to smoke weed. You have to know that where I'm from, nobody used a clip to smoke, because we didn't need too (we usually roll a mouthpiece/filter out of a slice of thin cardboard so that we don't have to smoke until the very end). Even so, I wanted to know what it was, because it looked really cool, so I asked the guy about it, and he told me that it was called *roach clip*, and he even knew a shop nearby where I could get one. Cool! Obviously that was one souvenir I absolutely needed to bring back home!

So the next day, at around noon, I was in the shop, couldn't what I was looking for, so I asked one of the pretty young ladies at the cash register, if they had any roach clips. You see, I had never thought once about the meaning of the word 'roach' in this context. I knew what it meant (literally), but it's actually quite difficult to acquire second meanings of words like that. So it took me about year until I realised why they both had a surprised and amused look on their face, before one of them answered: 'yes, we have *cigarette* clips'.

Moments later I decide to go in and notice the door is now locked from the inside, because I stupidly locked the handle out of habit before I went out and I'm stuck a storey up in the air. 

I'm home alone and I've left my phone inside. No one to contact to help me get back inside and no one will be home for at least 4 hours. Every single door in the house in unlocked besides the one I need to get through. I'm stuck.  

The hail had damaged my balcony roof to obliteration and the sun's beaming through as it is midday. I'm as pale as fresh cum,  and I can feel the burn on my skin. I'm sitting on all the roof peices that have been scattered across the balcony just thinking of something to do to get back inside. 

I found a rope that was tied to the pole and to my great idea I thought I'd tie it better and climb down the balcony. I climb over and try to slide down,  but the rope is to thin for me to get a good enough grip and I climb back over in fear of falling. I sit back down and patiencely wait for someone to come home. 

After 2 hours I finally think of tieing a knot in the rope so I can get a better grip, then loops to slide my feet into. Im confident I can do it now,  I'm burned and tired and just want to get inside so I'm not going to give up. I climb over and slide my   foot into the first loop. I let go to lower my self to the next loop, still with 1 hand on the balcony for stability. I get my next foot in the next loop and I'm half way there I'm so excited I let go of the balcony to go further and I slip, smash the senser  lights, trying to regain myself and just go for the next loop, I end up swinging down into the glass door and smash a big cobweb like shatter across the glass. I didn't go through it other wise it probably would've hurt. 

I slide the rest of the 30cm down in complete shock and relief. I don't even care for the window and light. I'm finally down from up there, I went inside to discover i was stuck up there for 2 hours. I'm left with incredible blisters from hanging onto the rope so hard though. Probably won't be going onto my balcony anytime soon.

I am a recent college graduate, and I've been on the job hunt since October or so. I had a healthy saving built up from work and student loans, but savings won't last me forever. I have been using my college email as my primary email for six years, and upon graduating, I realized that I needed to change it. Here's where I screwed up. My college uses a combination of your first and last name, with three random numbers behind it. For example, if your name is Dan Smith, your email might me Dasmit678@college .edu.

111,tifu,"First off, apologies for the formatting, I'm typing this out on mobile.

For context, I do some voice acting work here and there, typically small projects and I do this all in the comfort of my closet turned recording studio. Cut back to about a week ago, I had been messing around with my guitar and really have had an itch to record and practice producing some songs. I'm a total amateur though and had only just installed a music production app on my computer that a producer friend of mine recommended to me. My closet, however, is definitely not a great space for me, my recording equipment AND my guitar, so I decided it was best if I moved it all out of my closet so I had more space, even if it sacrificed a little audio quality, it was only for practice purposes anyways. 
Now, in the openness of my room, I start some recordings and it all sounds... wrong. Even with my gain down at 0 somehow the audio was still peaking (in very simple terms audio sensitivity at lowest but sound was VERY loud). I double, triple checked and everything seemed right but I couldn't figure out the issue. I chalked it up to my inexperience with the software and called it quits for the day.

A few nights pass and I never moved my equipment from the corner of the room and had knocked into it a few times. Then I found some cool casting calls I wanted to audition for. All paid work, plus one from a content creator I was really interested in trying to audition for. So I grabbed all my gear once again, shuffled it all back into place in my closet, pulled up the lines, got very excited to try out some new characters and began recording.

As an idiot, I didnt mic test before doing the first audition. I had recorded for about 10 minutes finding the voice I wanted only to stop recording and listen back to hear that my audio sounded oddly tin-like. This wasn't like the issue I was having before when recording music (badly). This was garbage quality that was embarrassing to consider submitting. I did everything in the book to try and solve the issue. Tried different drivers for my interface, tested cord issues (though didnt have a second cord), checked my sound treatment, but nothing was fixing the issue. After close to an hour of failed trouble shooting I asked a friend if I could borrow an xlr cord to see if I just needed a new cord or if I had to look into replacing the expensive stuff; the mic or interface.

Two days pass, I've missed the deadlines for some projects I was really looking forward to, including the one by the content creator I was interested in auditioning for. It is now today.
With a new XLR cord in hand, I unplug the cord from the interface and put the new one in. And then I unplug the old one from the mic. I try to plug the new one in but I cant get the right angle on it, so I move the popfilter out of the way. The popfilter rests a bit away from a microphone and is the nylon and plastic screen. And now as I move the god damn cursed screen away from the microphone I can now see the mic in a way that I hadn't before. Staring at me like the black mocking crow that it is, reads the word ""Back"". I stop, deadpan stare at the microphone for a good 90 seconds or so, and to the voice over demons in my closet I hear myself groan out ""are you fucking kidding me.""

I simply spin the microphone around so it's now front facing, press the record button, do a microphone test saying something along the lines of ""I'm about to be so god damn happy BUT SO HECKING MAD IF THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE CRAP."" Playback, and sure enough it's the warm sound of wonder that my mic should be.
Spent all day in my closet-booth today on an audition spree which felt great but, still a bit bitter that I missed out on some opportunities over these last few days though. Still no explanation for why the music software doesnt like my mic though!

I look at my gum. I look at the gum I found on the bus. I look at my gum. I look at the gum I found on the bus. My mind takes me back to the bus. I am suddenly imagining that some poor soul dropped their gum, and I, without missing a beat, have picked it up and walked away.

They must have watched in disbelief as I walked out of the bus with their gum in hand. I feel like a dirty thief.

I guess there's nothing I can do now. i didn't see the person who's gum I stole's face, and the bus is long gone.

Now I am going to chew a piece of (my own) gum to console myself.",TIFU by accidentally stealing someone's gum.

It was iterations of crying until the last one where it said feet pics $50 so i slid up (this was on snapchat) and said ""what if your crying in the feet pic😂"". Quick as a fucking whistle she goes 55 so i laugh and think ost funny and then she goes ""sooo you want one?"". My heart fucking drops a girl i used to have a crush on just asked if i wanted to buy feet pics cause of a joke i made.

115,tifu,"oBlIgAtOrY, this happened about 5 years ago. 


One morning I wake up, the sun is shining, smell of fresh air rushing through the window. I'm 14 and ready to start another day of doing stupid shit on my school holidays.


I get an itch down below, and get the shock of my life when I realise one of my testes has failed to show up for morning orientation. I freeze for a couple seconds before initiating a search and rescue. I couldn't find it, I even started looking OUTSIDE my body and under the sheets. 


I then realised, the last remaining teste, was unusually swole. The plot thickens. I like to call him, ""The Swole Survivor"". 


Then, all at once, answers to the universe came flooding to me. I had slept so rough, I managed to transfer my right nut, from the right sack, to the left nut, in ITS left sack.


What had to happen next was obvious, I had to somehow take immigration services (my fingers) and deport it back to where it came from. 


It hurt, but I was so freaked out and pumped with adrenaline, I moved it in under a minute and was too busy feeling the relief of not having my testes literally squished together. 


The question is, did I deport the correct nut? And that is how my FU has followed me to today, where the pains have been getting worse. Instead of once a month, it's now every few seconds. Yes, I am aware of testicular tortion. No, I do not want to lose a testicle. Ball is life after all. I am getting it checked tomorrow, and keeping a close eye on it for now

I had great fun writing this, actually made my situation slightly better, Go raibh máith agat

116,tifu,"So actually happened today. me and my partner have been talking about bondage sex for a while, have experimented with belts and some random rope i had laying around the house, but it was too course and didn't feel good for her. we talked about buying specific bondage rope from sex shop, but as its not #1 on our list of priorities we haven't actually made any effort.

so today me and my pops are doing some home maintenance and he gave me his card to run down to the hardware store to pick up some stuff. the clerk asked me if i needed help finding anything and i said i like to find things myself. i like being able to pinpoint exactly what i need whithin the endless isles of the home improvement store. as im walking up and down the isles looking a bulk spool of soft rope catches my eye. its nice and thick and SOFT. i pick it up and its exactly what im looking for in bondage rope. i ask the nearest clerk to cut me 10ft of it, i grab the stuff for my pops and im out the door feeling smug.

when i arrive home i coil it up seductively on the bedsheet and snap a pic to my parnter saying ""guess what i bought"" to which se replies ""omg can we use it tonight?"" yes we can. but first i gotta finishn up the work with my father, so i pull the blankets over the rope just in case he happens to look into my room. dont need him seeing an obvious bondage rope. so now its sandwiched between my blanket and my sheet. 

when its finally time to get down to business, im laying on my bed waiting for her to come over, reading about different tying techniques and absentmindedly rubbing the rope all over my face and neck and arm as is soft and feels nice. she comes in and i tie her up and we start going at it. and i cannot stop FUCKING ITCHING. im seriously dying im itching so bad. just all over. she's itching too, i have to untie her and take the rope off shes itching so bad. we're both just like WTF?! 

it must be the rope right? we go in for a closer inspectionand we find out the super soft rope isnt made of traditional material, but instead little strands of fibers about 1-2in each. shes like ""whta the fuck kinda rope did you buy"" im like idk it was in bulk on a spool, i didnt think to look. these little fibers are EVERWHERE. all over the sheet, all over the blanket, all over our cloths, all over our bodies, just covered from head to toe in little itchy fibers. i dont even know what to do, as i have no idea what the fuck i even bought. i go to the stores coporate website and search ""rope"" and start looking through all the results. i get to page 39 before i find it: fiberglass rope gasket. for wood stove doors. its a high temp rope used to seal the heat in on stove doors. kinda like this:
https://www.acehardware.com/departments/heating-and-cooling/wood-and-pellet-stoves/wood-and-pellet-stove-parts/49978
so basically i infested my bed and then fucked on tiny little razor sharp shards of fiberglass that got all up in everthing. had to wash my sheets , blankets, clothes, and shower real good, and now i'm pretty safe, the itching has stopped at least. shes not happy. i dont thing im getting laid tonight folks

117,tifu,"This happened 1 hour ago and I almost shit my pants. So I was at the gym and the next exercise was tricep-extensions.  There is a machine that can do both of these and you can change to whatever handle you want(important later). So there was another lady at the same machine there doing bicep curls and as usual, I ask her to use the machine after her set and go alternately. I do my set she does hers and after a bit and I tell her to do one more because I wanted to rest a bit more. The thing is I hadn't changed the kilos and she didn't notice it (she was doing 5 fewer bars) so when she goes to lift the bar the machine trembles and my handle falls onto her head because apparently the ""clip"" that was holding the METAL handle I was using wasn't tight/strong enough. Now the thing I learned from this experience is that the head likes to bleed a lot even on the smallest of cuts but I didn't know that. So now after a loud clank, this lady is bleeding quite a bit, it was not pouring or anything but still scary. Thank god she was alright despite the cut and didn't need to go to the hospital for stitches (the gym staff checked). She told me it's not a big deal and it's her fault for not checking, though I still feel pretty bad.

Right before i am about to leave to go to the bathroom, her freind says that were flirting really loudly. And i blushed so god damn hard, making it look like i actually am «flirting».

One day a girl comes to me and we start talking about our favourite animals. She tells me that she absolutely adores sloths and she loves them so much. I then - not thinking before talking - tell her an interesting fact about sloths that i find hillarious. Maybe some of you already know what i mean, but for those who are oblivious: Sloths are sometimes so stupid that they tink their arms are treebranches, grab them and fall to their death. When she realised, that her most beloved animals in the world die on a regular basis because of their stupidity, she got extremely upset and startet to get watery eyes. She asked me, if there are people on the ground who would catch these poor animals. In this moment i already realised, that i fucked up and assured her, that there are several people always watching the sloths in their natural habitats to prevent any unnecessary deaths.

TLDR: I told a girl that sloths die on regular basis bc they think their arms are treebranches, making them fall to their death.

I live in the UK, but I'm American. I'm wondering if this is a cultural thing. I basically got reamed and made out that I am an ungrateful asshole because it made me uncomfortable having a stranger trying to open my front door.
 
I have a big box for parcels that is just across and to the right of the front door, which he would have had to walk by. 

All the commenters said they would prefer for the driver to open the door and leave the parcel in their house than have to go collect it.

I have now exposed myself as an asshole, which I don't think I am. 

I wasn't sure where to put this post, but what I'd like to know is if I'm being weird feeling uncomfortable about a stranger, DPD driver or not, feeling it's OK to just try his luck at opening my front door with no prior permission or invitation of any kind.

121,tifu,"My wife and I recently had a major move out-of-state because she got a great job. In preparing to leave my previous job, the offer for full time remote work to continue my employment was rescinded for legal reasons. So I polished up my résumé and started applying. 

It’s strong. It’s creative. I have friends and spouse proofread it. Nobody finds anything wrong. I review again. All looks good. So I’m sending it off glibly and confidently but getting little response. 

I review the content. Oh look, I misspelled a work (Edit: leaving that there it’s too appropriate) and it squeaked through spellcheck. Damn. Oh well, it happens, proofing our own copy is really hard, nothing to do but move on. 

Before we move my wife’s new employer invites me to send along my résumé and to keep my eyes open for two marketing and communications jobs that will be opening soon. Unfortunately they open and close the listings while I’m deep in the midst of packing and driving cross country. I noticed them but the descriptions were odd and didn’t seem like the right fit and anyways I was up to my eyeballs in moving boxes and address changes and house hunting and driving almost 2000 miles. 

Arriving in my new state I mentioned the weird job descriptions to the contact there who tells me that they’re totally open to being flexible and just didn’t have the time to get the right description approved (it’s a state job). But if I hurry I might still get in on the process. 

I’m applying to other jobs. I don’t even have my printer yet so I have to print at Staples. Businesses are getting my résumé and it really is a good one. 

Today I stop by the state job’s HR department, drop of my résumé and portfolio, and then make the right networking phone calls. Hopefully they’ll make an exception and interview me for these closed jobs. Tonight I go to update my information on Indeed and see that I wrote “makes” instead of “make” IN MY VERY FIRST SENTENCE. And what’s this? An unintentional forced line break somehow ended up in the middle of a list of my strengths that includes attention to detail and formatting?? And yes, all the PDFs I’ve been printing have those very issues.

I’m not getting anywhere in interviews, and now I see that every résumé I’ve sent out this whole time has effing typos. Lots of them. I’m a graphic designer. If I can’t be trusted to proofread a document like this, I can’t be trusted to make sure a big budget print project is accurate and won’t need an expensive re-printing.

122,tifu,"  

This was actually last Friday, not today. Thursday night I'd taken an edible and consumed a couple glasses of wine, so naturally I slept through my alarm, as one does, and woke up in a panic. Isn't that a great feeling? I think I'd hit ""off"" instead of snooze on my phone, and I was already an hour late to work. Normally, I commute via train but because I was so late, and work is so far, I just called a Lyft. It's bloody cold out, so I got my hoodie, my backpack, keys, wallet, phone- wait do I have pants on? Okay great- it all seemed to be in order, so I booked it out the door and made my way to the car that was waiting for me. I Got in my ride and spent a hazy twenty minutes or so half asleep, listening to a podcast, and trying not to dwell on how pissed my job would be that I was late. We get to my job, I exit the ride and grab my stuff. I get inside and go to put on my hoodie because it's an office so of course it's frigid. Then I realized my mistake. I hadn't actually brought my hoodie in with me. No, I had in fact brought my bathrobe. A gross, old, haggard looking black bathrobe with dried paint stuck aggressively to one arm, old singe marks from dropped cigarettes, and a distinct odor of dog permeating it. Awesome. Just... fabulous. But I was cold, it's pretty casual here, and I don't have any auxiliary coats or sweaters at my job (poor planning really) So I decided ""f- It"" and so I would just take it off whenever I had to stand up, and put it back on when I sat at my desk, I just sprayed some perfume on it and tried to play it off like it was a comfy sweater that had seen better days. I was surprised and pleased by the fact that no one, in fact, seemed to notice the ghastly thing that I was sporting, sort of abashedly- I didn't even get in trouble for being late, so I was feeling a-okay. However, it dawned on me that that very evening I actually had a piece of art that was supposed to be showing in an gallery for an event/ opening, and there was no way I'd have had time to get all the way home, get a jacket or coat or whatever, and get back to the gallery in time for the party. It's dark, cold, and pissing rain outside when I leave work. I'm freaking out inside because I can't show up to a gallery opening in a bloody bathrobe without looking like a crazy person, but I also absolutely can't go without because it's way, way too damned cold and wet. I certainly got some weird looks on the train, but it's public transit and honestly, I've seen more people lumbering around in bathrobes than I can shake a stick at, so I wasn't especially self-conscious about it. Besides, it’s not their opinions I’m worried about, but the people who might buy my art I \*was\*. In what's got to be one of the greatest strokes of luck I've ever blundered into, I discovered that there was a military surplus store next door to the gallery, so I go in and manage to procure a fantastically cozy new sweatshirt with the logo of the shop on it for a very reasonable sum. I’ve already gotten a bunch of compliments on it. The gallery show went swimmingly, and though I didn’t sell the piece of art, a good time was had by all. So the moral of the story is, even when you fuck up \*spectacularly\*, sometimes, if you’re just lucky enough, things can still work out, and I love my new hoodie! I’d call that the proverbial “dodging the bullet”. I am going to be making some changes though: Get a better alarm clock, go to bed on time, and keep a change of clothes at work. 

TL;DR: I brought my gross old bathrobe instead of my hoodie to work by accident because I was hungover and late, then had to go to an art show in the evening. I managed to not get noticed wearing the bathrobe at work (too cold to not wear it), not get in trouble for being late, and found a military surplus store next to the gallery that had cheap, comfy hoodies, and managed to come out of a spectacular wardrobe blunder completely unscathed.",TIFU and wore a bathrobe to work
123,tifu,"Technically this was yesterday, but I've now recovered and able to post this story.  


For a bit of context, I am extremely prone to passing out. It runs in my family, and is often caused by anxiety (don't do well with blood etc). Having passed out so many times in my life for the smallest of reasons (even paper-cuts), I'm not concerned when feeling faint. I will lay myself down and the feeling will either pass, or I will proceed to lose (then regain) consciousness. The biggest danger I would consider is falling down when unprepared, knocking my head on the way down.

In situations where I'm feeling faint, I will generally prefer to completely pass out as it will alleviate all pain and discomfort. If I stay conscious I am often in a state of nausea for \~30 minutes. Unfortunately this isn't really something I am able to control.

If I find myself feeling faint in a group setting I will usually isolate myself either to a bathroom or a bed, so as not to worry/bother anyone. I'm 28 years old and have been doing this for as long as I remember. Most people that know me are aware of my condition.  


Yesterday was like any other time, I was playing some video games with friends and started feeling faint. I made my way to my room to lay down on the bed. I find I prefer laying on firm surfaces when feeling faint so I decided to lay on the ground instead. Laying down staring at the ceiling everything started going white and I passed out.

This is where I usually wake up dazed and confused and that's that.  


This time however, I woke up in immense pain and unable to breathe. Everything was black and my face was drenched in what I believed to be sweat. I was in an extreme state of panic and was fighting myself to get up, but my body was unresponsive. Instinct kicked in and I managed to get my hands to my face, realizing quickly that it was not sweat, but rather vomit.

Still barely able to breathe, extremely light headed, confused and choking on my own vomit I stumble my way to the bathroom and get the attention of my Fiancee and roommates.  
I was still shaking and coughing vomit out of my lungs half an hour later.  
Most terrifying moment of my life.

124,tifu,"Posting with an alt-account as I have IRL friends on my main and I don't need them to see this.

Obligatory disclaimers: This didn’t happen today, happened last week. And English is not my first language so please excuse any mistakes.

So as we all know, most members of the male sex polish their carrot from time to time, no biggie. And after years of doing it, we get pretty good at finding the opportune times to polish our carrots uninterrupted. A few days ago I found myself at such a convenient time; house for myself, just about to go take a shower and my carrot was long overdue for a good wax. Being abnormally horny and certain I had the house to my lonesome self, I got adventurous and decided I would upgrade from my usual setup and stream a sexyvid to the big 72” tv in the living room, instead of taking my laptop to my bedroom as I usually do.

I rig myself on the couch, curtains drawn, my fav fapmaterial at the ready, the volume on low *(just in case)* and I go to town. Not even 1 minute in, I hear the door burst open. I completely panic, I try to turn off the TV and sheathe my PP as fast as humanly possible, failing at both. When the TV finally goes black I shamefully cast a look over to the door expecting a furious parent, instead I barely catch a glimpse of my dad as he smacks the door shut without saying a word.

For the first time in my life, I had gotten caught masturbating. I avoided my dad altogether the rest of the day hoping he was too embarrassed to get mad so we both could just pretend it never happened. The next day I couldn't avoid him anymore and I had prepared myself to get scolded for jerking off in a family room, but he didn't seem mad at all, there was just this awkward tension between us and all interactions we had were short and abrupt. Our strained interactions and the feeling of him distancing himself from me made me feel more ashamed and filthy than any amount of scolding could ever do so I decided it would probably be better to clear the air by apologising outright. So I plan an apology and ask him to drive me to the gym (a 15-minute drive) and as soon as we were both in the car I blurt out an apology for my indecency, asking if we can just forget the whole thing.

He sends me a sort of confused look and says ""You don't have to apologise, it's perfectly natural and as long as you clean up properly I don't care where you do it. Hell, me and your mom have had sex on that couch many times."" - I should have understood something was up when he said this, he never talks about stuff like this when I am around. He has never once mentioned or joked about him and mom in any sexual or flirtatious context. I was so perplexed by his directness that I didn't even have time to be embarrassed or disgusted at the thought of my parents doing the nasty before he continued:

""If anything I should apologise for bursting in on you like that. I really didn't expect to find you, when I heard the noises I thought..."" The awkward silence that followed was unbearable, and my curiosity got the better of me so I asked

Me: ""What did you think was happening? Did you think I was with a girl?""

Dad: ""Oh no no, if I came home to you having company over I wouldn't just barge in like that. No, I... I thought it was your mom. When I heard the... sounds I got so angry because thought your mom was cheating on me. Again.""

Me: ""Oh.""  *WHAT! Mom cheated on dad!?!?!?*

Dad: ""I really shouldn't tell you about this. I don't want to change the way you look at mom, but your mom and I have been... Our marriage has not been easy.""

For the second, but far from the last time that car ride I was completely perplexed and speechless. I won't go into more detail, but the general gist as I understand it is that my parents have had a marriage with enough drama to make a 5 season tv show. And somehow they have managed to keep the majority of it secret from me and my sister for years. And the only reason I got to know about it is that I jerked off in the living room.

Needless to say, that car ride took a little longer than 15 minutes as we never made it the gym and it must have been one of the most world view altering and disillusioning conversations I have ever had or will ever have. If I could go back in time I would stick to jerking off in my room.

TL;DR : Dad caught me jerking off in the living room, triggering a conversation about sex and personal life where he revealed that my parents have had a back and forth ""tv-show worthy"" drama for years.

Final edit: Thanks for all the kind words, guidance and laughter. I decided to write this out and post it mostly just because I wanted to know if my situation was as absurd as I felt it was. I also felt I had to share it with someone, and posting anonymously felt like the easiest way to reach people without involving them. *I admit I also suspected it was so absurd it had to get some attention (though I wasn't expecting this many people would read it).* What really surprised me however was the amount of support I received and how much reading your stories, experiences and viewpoints would help me to think rationally about what happened and enable me to figure out what I really thought and felt about all of this. Thank you so much!

Many people have asked me to post an update giving some more detail about what happened between my parents. I have decided I will not share what my dad told me, first of all, because it is not my story to share. Secondly, because I don't know the full story (or even half of it) and could therefore tell it wrong giving you an incomplete picture. I have realized how much reading your comments affect me and how I see things, so I am afraid that I might base my own feelings on misunderstandings and wrong assumptions.

Again thank you all for the laughter and support. Sorry if I didn't respond to your messages or comments, but I only have two eyes and ten fingers.

This morning while getting ready to leave for work I realized I couldn’t find my car keys. My car keys have my office keys on them so I couldn’t just use my spare key to drive to work. 

The clock was ticking closer to when I had to leave so I started searching more and more frantically. 

Realized they may have been lost under my bed, I dove to the floor, yanked my phone out, turned on the flashlight, and proceeded to smash my watch against my metal bed frame on accident.

126,tifu,"Before starting, I need to mention something especially to the car enthusiasts who'll say I am a moron (which is true). Yes, I have changed my windshield washer before and yes, I know how it looks like but not antifreeze water.

So today my mom needed the car I'm usually driving which is a smaller car compared to the car my usually dad drives and she likes it better. It is also an older model, so it has less technological stuff on it. The one mostly used by my dad is bought recently so I'm somewhat stranger to it and it's features since I rarely drive it. So this morning while I was on my way to work, I tried to clean the windshield but the washer was not coming out. The problem is that it was just the front windshield that was not getting washed, rear one was working perfectly fine. So this got me worried since I'm not used to driving this car and it has a different mechanism for washing the front windshield. I called my dad to ask if it was normal. He said it's probably running out of washer and told me to buy a bottle of washer on my way. The gas station I usually visit and buy stuff like this was on the opposite side of the road so I went to the one I rarely visit since I didn't have time to go there. They had these fancy bottles looking all the same and all of them had antifreeze written on them. Since my dad especially said antifreeze washer my stupid brain was focused on the word ""antifreeze"" and did not bother to check bottles to see what it actually contained.

I opened the bottle to pour it in and realised that the washer was looking a bit slimey and it was red instead of blue. I was like ""Heh, it's funny looking"" and I actually liked the red coloring tbh. I  filled the washer tank and started driving. The first thing I did after that was of course, trying to clean my windshield. Though it was not getting clean no matter how many times I tried. Instead, it was just getting blurry so I stopped using the washer and it got back to normal (I was able to see clearly at least). After parking I cleaned the windshield with a piece of fabric and used the washer again, thinking it won't be blurry after work.

Well, I found my windshield to be blurry after I left the office. It was the moment I realised I fucked up. I called my mom and asked if my dad was with her since I knew she was going to pick him up from work. She said yes and asked if I wanted to talk to him. I told her that I did not and told her how I fucked up. Thankfully she is a pretty chill person and said things like that could happen. My dad though, he heard the story after a few minutes and got a little mad. He said he'll call the repair guy we go to and ask if it'll harm the car furthermore. As my dad mentioned afterwards, it was fine but I should not use the washer until it is cleaned.

I'll probably take the car to the shop tomorrow since I'm a part timer and my school's on a winter break. I don't want my dad to deal with a problem I caused. Though I learned my lesson, from now on I'll stay away from red liquids.

So, I broke up with my bf and a few months have passed by. My ex already has somebody else and meantime I tried to hang out with a new dude but he was a cheapskate and brainwashed so things didn't work out.

Anyway, being single and ready to mingle it's pretty hard when you don't actually want to meet other new temporary people (bc Lord knows which type of guys I meet - I kinda have bad luck with this thing). So I thought to hit on a guy which I dated last year. This guy proposed to have the ""no string attached thing"" pretty quite early after my break up and I wasn't ready, but now I am, so I wrote him yesterday by proposing to spend the friday night together and he accepted.

The problem is: this guy is/was a friend (college) with my ex. Is it such a bad thing? I mean, my ex was a dick to me and the relationship was toxic because he was insecure about so many things and I have no obligation and also I deserve some good vitamin D (after a few mental breakdowns).

128,tifu,"Little info abt me:  
I'm 36 y.o. male. 5'7, I just started gym a few weeks ago to lose my little bulging tummy. I'm still in the process of moving on after my 3 years LDR break up a few months ago, trying to get some traction to meet and talk to girls that I really like -- not that I'm picky, but if I don't like the girl, there's no way ill be determined to go on.  


What happened:  
So I saw this girl last weekend on a herbal beauty product store, find her really really cute, but during those times I don't really notice that she's very young, I'm focusing on her charming face and smile. I ask abt some products I'm in my best self asking questions and making jokes. Told her ill be coming back to purchase.   


This evening I went to the store again, bought some stuff and in the counter I ask her if she just lives nearby,  anxiety creeps in fast, I stutter when I gave her my business card (lame I know) and told her that if she needs some design stuff she can contact me.  


Had dinner in the same mall, and just think through what happens, I got worried not just bcs the name card move was lame as fuck, and thinking about age differences also (though I haven't verified it during these times). After dinner, I go back to the store and say my apologies for being weird giving her the card, she told me that 'yes, she got confuse.' then ask her if she's still in Uni. She told me that 'Yes, that's why, I'm barely 20 so I was really confused'' (with a smiling face - work mode?). I told her I'm really sorry but told her I can still help her when she needed design and went my way out.  


TLDR: I went to talk to a salesgirl to try to get her number, but instead I give her my business card. I went back after eating dinner and told her sorry for weirding her out - for the calling card and for not noticing that she is very young.",TIFU by hitting on a 19-year-old salesgirl
129,tifu,"So okay, it was the other day, but I stumbled onto this sub today and had to share.

So I currently live with my parents. My kit (Computer) was in the family den, the same room as the (only) TV. My dad is a bit of a movie buff, so usually every night or two he'll come in and watch a movie or a couple of episodes of TV or something. Now when he's doing this I can't concentrate. At this time of night, I'm not doing anything important and it's clear because I'll be playing video games (I did once manage to play a game for a school project, but that's a story for another time and sub). Now because neither of us is doing anything important, he gets priority because he's dad and that's how it is.

So last fall my brother went off to college and took his computer out of our bedroom. For some reason, my brain wiring didn't connect and realize that there was this nice free desk far away from the TV until Sunday. That night we had dinner at my nana's like we do every week (she lives two blocks away) and after the meal, I wandered back home and put my plan into action. I would have done it sooner except that A) my other brother and his partner were using the den and I didn't want to bug them and B) my mom is a total tsundere (especially when tired on a Sunday afternoon) and I can never tell what's going to set her off. I tear down my setup (I don't have a proper tower, so I use a laptop and external monitor rig) and have it set up in about half an hour. Time to move the network.

Now my home network is weird. It's an old house with bad paint and building material (I haven't gone looking for asbestos, but I wouldn't be too surprised). The dinky router/modem combo my internet company gives can't begin to cover it, and it doesn't help that its positioned way off-center from the house with the family box, which has been there way longer than we've had anything else to plug into it. We tried using a WiFi extender but it just fought with the router and made things worse, and I have a couple of old routers (One I picked up from the remains of a yard sale at a community center I interned at and another that the ISP gave us back before they gave us an integrated modem/router combo (Combos of such devices are all kinds of stupid in my opinion, but again another sub another time) and never got around to taking back. I have one in our room, and one in the den, making an L-shape across the house. They all make their own networks so we have to switch manually when we move, but at least we can watch Netflix in the back of the house.

Now my personal router isn't just an access point, it's got a bunch of configuration I have on it and it runs a custom firmware the bedroom router doesn't support and the stock firmware can't do half of what my chosen CFW is capable of. I *need* that router to stay with my kit.

Sorry for the long backstory, but here's where I effed up.

Turns out when I moved the bedroom router (Belkin.90c, not its original name, I changed it to a Belkin name to screw with anyone trying to break in) into the den, I managed to plug the cable from the main router into one of the LAN ports on 90c. 90c, of course, has its DHCP turned on, and for obvious reasons, the main router hybrid (SynologySmartConnect, again not its original name) has its DHCP turned on because I do *not* have the time to manually assign IPs, nor do I actually have a reason to. Now the short version of what DHCP is for my nontechnical readers is that it hands out those sweet sweet IP addresses to each device on the network so we can be lazy and not give one to each device manually. To sum up, I've plugged 90c into Synology so that they both have their DHCP servers facing ""in"" towards each other rather than 90c being a firm subnetwork of Synology like it should. And only one of these DHCP servers is actually connected to the internet.

Can you figure out this is a bad thing? Because this is a VERY BAD thing. Normally I'm good with analogies, but I can't think of a particularly good one for this so here's my best. Two cars are broken down going opposite directions on a one way street in the middle of nowhere. One driver doesn't have a phone, and the other one has a phone, but is a total Karen and refuses to call a tow truck. This is when Murphy decided that the rest of the family should get home. Somehow, Mom's devices connected to Synology's DHCP and she was off on her merry internetting way. Everyone else's devices saw 90c and decided to play with it. This went about as well as you'd expect and nobody could do anything. Fortunately, I spend enough time reading /r/talesfromtechsupport (and am currently training to go into IT), so I knew that since the only thing that had recently changed was my switching the APs, that &lt;sarcasm&gt;maybe, just *maybe*&lt;/sarcasm&gt; those two events were linked. One port swap later, 90c and Synology were happily separated and the rest of the house was back online.

I know it's not much of an eff up, but it's what I have.

TL;DR: Plugged two routers into each other, DHCP conflicts ensue and knock out most of the house.",TIFU by plugging in a router wrong
130,tifu,"Every day I get home from school I have a good 2 hours to myself before any of my family gets home from work. Usually I’ll do homework, take a shower, or, most commonly, beat my dick.

Now since I don’t have to worry about anyone barging in I’ll jack off ANYWHERE, sometimes just spread eagle, butt-ass naked on the carpet because, why not? Today was one of those “why not?” type of days and within the 10 second period of silence after finishing to a max-volume cacophony of orgasms, I hear footsteps. Naturally I freak the fuck out and get up off the floor so I can throw some clothes back on and run to my bathroom, but I forgot about the massive load I busted into my left hand.

I pretty much smeared semen all over my clothes, my phone, and carpet trying to avoid an awkward confrontation with one of my family members, and as I’m processing just how much of a horny idiot I am, the footsteps get louder and louder, only for my new kitten to open the bathroom door with her loud ass feet.

131,tifu,"I was at a friends birthday party at her apartment and as a group of twenty somethings often do we decided to play cards against humanity. At some point a card was played with the term “bukkake” was used and one of the younger girl (20 years old) said she didn’t know what it was. The laughter ensued from her innocence and the birthday girl told her to look it up. This is where I made my mistake saying “make sure to go incognito and look for videos”.

I should mention at this point in four beers deep and thinking she’s gonna do it later and I’ll get a laugh. I was wrong. On the couch in full view of everyone she proceeds to google what it was and look for videos. Even worse she then proceeds to watch the video in front of all of us. It gets worse as she begins to narrate what was happening asking which aspect of it was the bukkake. Everyone was awkwardly laughing with her friend trying to explain it.

No one knew how to tell her that she should continue her research later and the birthday girl called me into her room later to ask me why I told her to look for a video and all I could say was I didn’t expect her to do it.

Needless to say the party went amazingly

132,tifu,"TL; DR: I work(ed) for one of those maverick types. Very splashy with their community personality but are really like a decaying tooth. Their internal work ethic sucks. They fired me because I told them how it is.

They were the most disorganized and scattered person I've ever reported to. The kind that gave a deadline and then made everyone scramble to do it earlier, had a briefcase of crumpled up papers, constantly dropped the ball and threw their inferiors under the bus....even more gross misconduct than all that crap, which I now have the pleasure of putting in writing for the Board of Directors but won't say here.

They called me in for a meeting to say I wasn't a fit with the place I had been kicking ass for in the last couple months. I said I wasn't a fit with them, personally in work style. They said NO it was the org. I repeated what I said. They then said it was one and the same. That sums it up for you. 

The conversation devolved from there in which I stayed even keeled and they flew off the handle. They asked for feedback. I gave it. They yelled at me that I was turning it around on them.

I suddenly realized what gaslighting is. 

They are a piece of work. I realized as this was going down that they were going to fire me, and asked for more opinions. They used the vague ""many others believe so, too."" It eventually came out they were talking about one interaction. I followed up with said aggrieved party and they didn't even remember it as any kind of issue.

So, at the end I said what I really felt. That they didn't understand the core competencies of my job. That they didn't understand the community we served. That they liked to call the CEO of a  rival non profit (so ridiculous that it even is like this; we do different things) a magolomanic, and that really that is what they are: absorbing programs with no infrastructure to support them. 

I said all this calmly. Later they told me that ""the entire office heard my tirade."" They also have said openly they hate our town but can't wait to leave. 

So at least someday when they retire (they're in their early 70s) I can chill around town in peace. Until then, I have learned some valuable lessons.",TIFU by giving my boss feedback when they asked for it; they didn't like it and I got fired
133,tifu,"Actually happened today.

Now, I don't mean adopted brother in the sense that my mother adopted someone into our family. I mean adopted brother in the sense that mom gave him up for adoption, then three years later had me and kept me. It's a miracle I even have contact with him, it was an open adoption so he'd visit often. We talk over Discord a lot. He randomly came into chat like ""Guys I spilled my drink"" and me, trying to be funny, referenced that one old vine that goes ""This is why mom doesn't FUCKING love you"". I only connected the dots after hitting send and it was too late by then. He immediately stopped talking. 

We have so much bottled up tension towards each other regarding the situation. He's jealous that mom kept me. I'm jealous because my mom was extremely abusive towards me while spoiling my other three siblings (including him, she'd always compare me to him and say how he's so amazing and I'm so terrible). He thinks mom doesn't love him and it hurts because she emotionally closed herself off to me in desperate attempts to reconnect with him, even though it was far too late. It's such a fucked up situation and I accidentally stirred something up that we haven't talked about in years. I feel absolutely terrible.

134,tifu,"This happened just a couple days ago, it's not the end of the world but it caught me off guard in an embarrassingly funny way.

TL;DR: I accidentally cursed due to being absent minded, my daughter's reply made me feel all sorts of different ways lol

My daughter just turned 3, her communication skills are getting better by the day. So that day for some reason her tummy was giving her issues so she was being difficult about eating. It was a cycle of her saying she was hungry, then a little back and forth about what is going to be eaten, and finally her taking one bite and saying she was done. Not even saying there was a problem, literally ""cool this was good, I'm full for the next 3 minutes"".

After applesauce, PB &amp; J, and pasta being prepared for no reason, I got the third ""all done!"" 30 seconds after dropping the plate with her, and I got a little frustrated.

Real quick side note, I try to not give my daughter too much of the ""baby talk"" as in I don't like having to dumb things down if it's unnecessary, especially because I'm bilingual so there's a whole other layer of development that I gotta be mindful of when I freely swap languages. So I try to keep it fairly down to earth if I can, to help her in the long run, unless we are playing or some other situation where I would be in character.

ANYWAY... So I'm a little frustrated and I'm in casual mode so after the third failed meal I slip up and I go ""oh come on man, are you fucking with me?"" And without missing a beat she goes ""no. I'm not fucking with you."" and it just kinda stopped me in my tracks lol it was supposed more of a comment I mumbled to myself, but she fed it right back to me and I kinda wanted to laugh but also kinda felt embarrassed for it, while also having to   let her know that I'd prefer if she didn't say that for reasons. 

Yeah I know, it's not all that crazy, but I thought it was kinda noteworthy one way or another and couldn't think of a better sub to share it on.

136,tifu,"So some background. I am a married (to a woman) nonbinary genetic male who enjoys going out in drag. I get my nails done every 2 weeks and the girl who does them is the most adorable person ever. We always chat it up, she loves anime, clothes/shopping, etc. I FB message her often but she rarely responds (clue #1).

The salon owner has told me in the past about stalkers she's dealt with early on in our friendship (clue #2). The salon owner talks to me a bit over Facebook.

Anyway, I really wanted to be friends (literally just friends) with the girl who does my nails so badly that instead of asking for her number to chat, I said ""I need to search for your number online so we can chat sometime"". There was another thing I said later that made it worse

This has lead me to be told not to return. And while I completely understand and the owner I think understands too, it made the girl who does my nails feel so awkward I don't think I can return.

And honestly I'm heart broken, because it was 100% my fault, and I have so few friends (my wife does but she's a tomboy lol) that know about my nonbinaryness that accept it, that it drove me to say stupid shit like this. But again it's my fault.

138,tifu,"This happened last night, I’m not telling our friends and family because we don’t want them being privy to our sex life. Throwaway blah blah blah. 

My wife and I moved across country this year, we haven’t  met any people that we’ve clicked with for friendship so without much of a social life, we’ve become sexual deviants outside of work. Getting all kinds of kinky with each other has been so much fun and reconnecting. 

Eventually we decided to invite another female to join us for some causal fun. A decision was made to make a tinder account as we didn’t want to go to bars (neither of us drink anymore), and we had not met any people we felt like good friends with, let alone anyone we’d like to fuck. 

Yesterday, we matched with someone. We had a group chat going and decided to meet at our place to get stoned and fuck since none of us had work today.

Wifey and I have been using weed lube for a few months, it definitely adds to the experience. I had applied it to her before our date arrived. We all got stoned and chatted for a bit when things started getting heated. We asked her if she wanted some and she was excited to try it.

 So, I start applying it to her while she is neck deep in my wife. She starts coughing a bit, but I didn’t think anything of it as we had smoked a couple joints just before all this. I notice her labia is swelling very quickly as well. 

The lube is made with coconut oil, she is allergic to coconuts and is having anaphylactic shock in her throat and vagina. She’s gasping out for her purse and epi pen, I’m having flashbacks of pulp fiction thinking I’m going to have to stab a passed out chic with an epi pen three times. 

Thankfully, the reaction subsided after she was stabbed (only once). She took some benedryl and we took her to the ER just in case. We stayed with her to save her the embarrassment of calling friends or family, and you know, because we nearly killed her. Just got home after she was released/dropping her off and I think it’s hilarious since everyone is ok. Wifey is scarred, her vagina nearly killed a woman. Hookup also saw the humor in it, we will end up meeting again sometime soon and by then I will have made a batch with avocado oil which she is not allergic to. 

We’re going to bed but I had to fucking tell someone. Goodnight/morning and be safe! 


TL;DR: lubed up wife and hookup with coconut weed oil and it nearly killed the hookup from anaphylactic shock.

Edit: recipe for the curious:

Cannabis lube:

1/4 ounce flower or 1 gram CO2 extracted live resin (preferred)

4 oz MCT coconut oil 

2 16 oz mason jars 

3 coffee filters (only if flower is used)

2 drops tea tree oil - it really makes a difference 

Small spray bottles- think perfume. 

Preheat oven to 240 degrees Fahrenheit 

Put oils and wax or flower in mason jar A and heat in oven on baking sheet with lid off for 80 minutes at 240 degrees, turn oven off and allow it to cool for about an hour. Strain through coffee filters if you used flower into the second mason jar and then fill the spray bottles. 

It’s actually a pre sex “lube” apply it to the vagina (inside and out) liberally 20 minutes before playtime.",TIFU by nearly killing our tinder date.

One day, I was alone in my room when I had the sudden urge to “do it.”  So, I pulled down my shorts and started rubbing one out.   Now, I have social media and follow some of my friends who some are girls.  I finished up to them but not after 30 minutes of pleasure.  (Btw, please tell me if it’s weird for guys to do that.

I thought I was in the clear, but later my mom told me how it was weird I actually took a nap.  I just played it off, and I hope she suspects nothing, but I started to think about it.  What if my mom actually caught me with my d\*ck in hand and knocked out?  This wouldn’t be as bad if my parents only knew I had social media.

141,tifu,"I have been betting a lot on New Year 2020. I was going to get financially stable and start saving by February and move on with the rest of my life. I had just gotten out of a court case and was set to become a different person.

Come New Year's eve evening, everybody was asleep by 10 at my place. I had no parties to go to, no friends to hang out with, and it was really just an eye-opening night for me. I was lonely and the only people I had were boring as hell. How hard is it to stay up past midnight?

So I left the house.

I drove to an airfield where there are no trees, and I just meditated for the rest of the night. I had thought about everything that had happened for me over the last 10 years, and what I could do over the next 10. I remembered all the bad things, and the good things.

Then the fireworks went off. They were beautiful.

About a minute after that, I turned my car on and started to drive off. I was still a little emotional (positive emotion) and was driving a little faster than normal. I'm a very good driver, so I had an extra sense of confidence.

Soon, the roads got a little windy and were freshly rained on. I noticed, and acted accordingly, but not enough. About a mile into the windy roads was a 90° turn which had no sharp turn signs (because if you were actually going the speed limit, you wouldn't have to worry about turning sharp). When I noticed the bend, it was too late. I stepped on the brakes, trying not to slam them so I could keep traction, but the car slid anyway. Should have fixed that ABS. I hit a utility pole going about 30mph on the far right corner, destroying my fender and throwing my wheel out of alignment and possibly screwing up my steering.

Thankfully, I was able to bend the fender back, test the steering and brakes, and drive home slowly. That was the worst new year ever.

So far, I'm only out $2000 since I'm doing my own labor. But that really put me back since I'm only making minimum wage.

Also, let me clarify that I was not drinking. This is an anonymous account so I have no reason to lie.


My cover-up story is that a deer probably got spooked by the fireworks and ran out in front of me. I slammed the brakes to avoid the deer and hit the utility pole instead.



TLDR: Don't get emotional and drive, even when you're careless. Emotion is terrible for when you need to focus. And even though I wasn't, I'll might as well stick in that you should never drink or text while driving. You inevitably *will* hit something, and you better pray that it's a utility pole.

I told him that I had to ask him something but in the end I chickened out and I felt too embarrassed. He tells me that I can ask him or not, it's whatever. But every time I am about to tell him, I just sit there in silence and awkwardness ensues. He says that he is going to take a shower and that I can ask him then.        

He gets out the shower since I took that as another sign (in hindsight, I have no idea why) but I finally  ask him if I could give him a blowjob, no-strings attached. He says no and that he appreciate the offer but still a no on his behalf. So, my thoughts are racing and just told him okay and that the cat is out-of-the-bag, which he agrees and he leaves for the store.        

Now, that gave me time to come up with an apology before he came back after some post-nut clarity. I practically just told him that I am sorry for crossing the line and did not mean to change his sexual orientation and that I was not in love with him. I just wanted to give him a blowjob. He threw a joke in there. He went to his room to go masturbate. Funnily enough, those times I knocked, he was getting ready for his private session. And no, I have not stalked him. When you live with someone for 3 years, you get to know their routines. His is just loud music and a closed door.       

Here I am now and I still can't look at him or even talk to him now. He has not said anything to be either.

146,tifu,"I was on the 401 and was having to get somewhere on a time frame. I was on track to make it on time however any stops would mean I would be late. I was driving on the 401 for a couple hours now and was now near Ajax with still a decent chunk of time to go.

Suddenly I felt like I had to go to the bathroom quite bad however I didn't feel like I had a lot in the tank. I noticed I had 2 large empty timmies cups in my cup holders so I figured one would suffice so I started to attempt to pee on the go.

FU#1 was deciding to wear sweat pants for comfort. It was very hard to maneuver my member and keep the band from slipping back over it. So one hand was trying to ankle the member and hold the cup while the other hand steered.

All was going smoothly until \*insert surprised pikachu meme here\* the cup is nearly full. ohfuck.jpeg well gladly I do have a back up cup that I can use however there is now a massive obstacle. My fellow males will know that it is quite difficult to just stop the stream once you've began without some fluids leaking out. So I now had to maneuver to put cup 1 back and grab cup 2 while making sure I didn't urinate all over myself.

I manage to get cup 2 in position and only had some minor spillage which was a small price to pay for urination. However yet again the cup started to get rather full. I had to now put cup 2 in the cup holder by this point I kept getting piss shooting out whenever my hand slipped off its grip for half a second and finally got the cup in the holder and the member secured.

Now I had Mission Impossible 3: Take the next exit ASAP and find a secluded place to step out and instantly urinate as I have to maintain pressure or piss all over myself. So I take the next exit and manage to find a dark area behind a subway. I get out and after some trickery getting my arm out of the seat belt and more urine managing to shoot out I finally was able to empty my tank.

By this point the entire bottom of my shirt is soaked and a good chunk of my pants on top of me now 100% being late. I thankfully had some clothes I could change into as well as some wet wipes to clean myself and the area.

I'm just thankful I wasn't pulled over by a cop or I would've had a *very* hard time explaining why my dick was out with my hand securely gripped around it along with the 2 tims cups filled with urine.

TL;DR: Tried to piss on the fly during the 401 ended up pissing all over myself 0/10 would not do again.

147,tifu," So obvs this is a throwaway. I feel so fucking embarrassed I just need to get it off my chest. I have suffered from depression most of my life and as I'm sure most people who have had it can relate, my self-esteem is super low. I got bullied at school, don't have many friends and I pretty much spent a lot of my adolescence and teens sleeping trying to avoid people, and because I felt so shit about my self I didn't really take care of my self either. In the sense of for a while found hygiene. I mean I showered and stuff but when I did eventually get a job and stuff I was usually nearly always running late so, basically I neglected my teeth for a while.

Gross, I know. But my logic was I hardly ever got toothache so I thought hey maybe I just have super strong teeth or something and tried to rationalise it like well cave people didn't have toothbrushes. Fucking stupid I know they also had a way shorter life span.

We anyway fast forward a decade or 2 and I have offspring of my own and I decided I really need to start doing the grown-up thing and take care of my self. I went to a dentist even though I have a super bad phobia of them and found out I needed 2 fillings and a root canal which I thought wasn't too bad considering. It turned out after having dental work done my teeth started to really hurt where they hadn't before, and when the dentist tried to do my root canal for some reason they decided to work on me 1st and not numb me. Needless to say, it killed, they gave me two injections to numb it but adrenaline was going by there I was anxious as fuck anyway, they stopped and did a temp filling and said they would refer me to another dentist to hopefully work on me whilst I was under anaesthetic. I got a letter from the other dentists they said they would do the same as the previous so I though nu-uh, fuck that. Never going back.

I had started to get over my fear but it came back after the no numbing incident. Fast forward a year or so and no issues with my teeth or pain so I was quite thankful to that little temp filling. But then I was eating some nuts and someone decided to throw a fucking rock in there or something (mega hard nut) and it broke one of my other teeth like the back of it came off. But the front was still there, no pain, so I thought let's just carry on this is fine. Today the front of it has gone, I think it must have fallen as I was eating something and now I have a cute little gap. If I want an implant and crown it'll be just under 2 grand, I'm on min wage so that's unlikely. So just call me gappy tooth McGee now guys (please don't).

So basically boys and girls. Take care of your teeth.

TLDR: got depression, neglected my teeth, fear of the dentist, went to the dentist anyway trying to do the adult thing, no numby root canal, much pain. Decided no more dentist, mega hard concrete type nut broke a different tooth. Now am gappy tooth McGee. Sad times",TIFU by learning how important it is to take care of your self the hard way

I know a few girls and they have a sort of habit of hugging me idk why but not when she is around, anyway  after she said she wasn't ready to be my gf I hugged another girl in front of her to make her jealous but then she gave me a piece of paper saying I hurt her feeling by hugging  another girl a lot and she said I am quick to replace people when I just wanted to make her jealous so she would hang out with me more and now idk what to do because she said she doesn't want to talk to me for a while and I really like her(we are both in highschool btw).

149,tifu,"Said private Instagram is not followed by either two other members of the groupchat. 

So I use this Instagram occasionally to express thoughts I have to my more close friends, and it tends to be stuff I don't say to most people.  I don't use it to gossip or make fun of anyone, just as a personal outlet.

I had the idea of taking a screen shot of part of this groupchat to use it as the image for the Instagram post I planned on making where I briefly mentioned the messages but then talked about other things.

So there I was, at around 9:30am, sitting on a display couch at Sam's club, after drinking coffee which lately I've been thinking might cause me personally to be extra tired or distracted.  I took the screen shot, cropped it in a separate app, switched to what my brain I guess assumed was Instagram, attached the image, typed of the caption, and hit send.  I immediately noticed the mistake and started panicking, trying to see if I can delete the message.  I can't.  I said something like ""oh shit don't hate me that wasn't meant for here"".  A few minutes into panicking I texted a different friend and asked if I should just kick them out of the group and make a new one, and she immediately said yes, so I did.  All I said in the new chat was that the old one got messed up so I made a new one.  There hasn't been any activity from either of them in either chat since yesterday night (and this happened just this morning) so I have no idea if they've seen it and haven't said anything or if they genuinely missed it.  One of the members is a close friend of mine and I believe he would have said something to me if he saw it, but the other is someone who I've struggled to be comfortable around due to some events that happened over a year ago and I don't know how they really feel about me currently, and the screenshot was specific to his message and I said something like ""can't tell if he hates me or not"" in my ""caption"".  I've been pretty anxious all day wondering if he's seen it and there's about a 50/50 chance but above all I just hope it doesn't fuel his possibly already intense dislike of me. 

I have a rehearsal with those two and the other members of our full group tonight and I'm contemplating just outright asking him how he feels about me just so I can know, regardless if it's positive or negative.  I'll also have to see if he behaves even slightly different around me, but honestly if he already dislikes me he might not act any different anyway so it'll be fun to find out.

TL;DR I shouldn't drink coffee and try to make a personal instagram post early in the morning because apparently my brain will assume groupchat = Instagram",TIFU by somehow mistaking a groupchat in the GroupMe app for my private Instagram
150,tifu,"I've been constipated lately. Not SUPER constipated, I was still going about 2 - 3 times a week, but I've been having to push quite a bit.  This is probably mostly due to the medications I take for my health issues. I've been on these meds for years and have never had any problems like this...I normally go daily as I usually take OTC stool softeners to help, but I have been having some difficulties lately swallowing the large (to me) pills. 

Today felt like THE DAY to shit. So I sat down on the toilet and got comfy. It was an EVENT. I felt like I was in labor. I imagined I was pushing out a baby. I was sweating and had to turn on the tap and splash water on my face repeatedly. It probably took me a good 30 minutes of seriously hard pushing. Eventually it was done and I felt so much better. 

But - wait. I stood up and something felt like there was some shit stuck to my butt? I wiped and couldn't get it. 

So I looked in a mirror. 

I am pretty sure I almost passed out. I saw....something...flesh colored on the outside of my butthole. I thought it was my intestines. I was sure of it. I tried to push it back in. It went in and popped back out. Oh no, I thought. This is bad. This is really bad.

I started hysterically crying and imagined I would have to go to the ER, hopefully not in an ambulance, because the embarrassment alone would probably kill me. I was also assuming that I would probably need emergency urgent surgery to fix the prolapse, and I was losing it. I am DEATHLY afraid of surgery (due to anesthesia). I would do anything to avoid it. ANYTHING. 

I called my mom, which in retrospect was a bad decision, but I wasn't thinking clearly.

Some backstory - my mom and I have a really bad relationship. She is a full blown raging narcissist (check out r/raisedbynarcissists for further explanation of her pathology) and I haven't spoken to her in over two weeks after the last round of problems that she caused when I was passing a kidney stone and having very painful bladder spasms and renal colic, and instead of speaking to me with kindness and compassion like a sane mother would do, she decided it was the perfect time to go on a rant consisting of approximately 40 texts insulting and systematically destroying my character. 

Some lovely things she has done to me include:

* never teaching me how to drive, swim, ride a bike, or function as an independent adult
* not getting me help when I had an eating disorder at age 16, weighed 53 lbs, and almost died
* telling me that I blamed her for my eating disorder when I tried to talk openly about some feelings and emotions that I felt might have contributed to it
* giving me a midnight curfew at the age of 28
* telling me I had to tell her where I was going and when I was coming home, every single time I left the house...at the age of 28.
* screaming at me constantly as her primary form of communication even on my birthday, and my dad telling me to shut my lips when I would try to defend myself for whatever she was mad at this time
* refusing to allow me to bring my boyfriend into my bedroom even during the day with the door open just for a minute or so
* opening my mail and packages with my name on it
* declining my mail at the door and getting the delivery person to mail it back to the original sender
* accusing me of being an alcoholic, because I had a medium sized bottle of fireball that I was slowly drinking from for 2 years
* dumping said bottle of fireball out in the garbage
* banning me from the resident list of the house I had been living in for 10 years so I would have had to enter the gate by going in her car every single time (I had to call cops twice to enter to get my things so I could move out immediately because I wasn't here for that fuckery)
* banning my boyfriend from the gate entirely so if he tried to get in police would be called on him
* threatening a restraining order against my boyfriend and I (just because I wanted to bring him into my room) 
* once I moved out and went out to dinner with my dad which my mom was aware of, and she texted me and asked me how the date with my boyfriend was going 
* telling me if I wanted to sleep with men (um...men? I had only one boyfriend...) to go to a hotel 
* screaming in public outside of my house that I treat her like a ""black slave""
* telling me that her friends (she has no friends) told her to disown me 
* threatening to disinherit me verbally and through texts, and getting my dad to do the same
* threatening me by telling me if I spoke to my grandparents they would disown me
* telling me that I supposedly said I want them to die so I can get their wealth
* telling me I am a horrible mean nasty person with evil bad intentions. when literally all I've ever done is just try to have some autonomy and independence...I am a good daughter and I was a good, boring kid. I was in the gifted program, got all As, spent all my time reading or sitting in the backyard on the rocking chair listening to Elliott Smith, never partied, smoked, did drugs, or even dated until my 20s. 
* telling me that I lie all the time
* telling me that I blame her, correct her, and criticize her, when I was just trying to be understood and heard
* accusing me of trying to break my dad &amp; her up, and told me that their love is stronger than I ever imagined (they fight all the time. I was sick as a child due to stress from their non-stop fighting and wanted them to divorce desperately. I confided this with my mom as a child which was a mistake)
* stealing some very, VERY expensive necklaces from me
* convincing my dad to steal my money (a. lot. of. money.) from me 
* refusing to let me have my own bank accounts with just my name on it
* getting incredibly irrationally angry that I don't tell her everything that happens in my life and getting mad if I tell anyone before her anything 

....&amp; that's just a fraction of it.

Despite all of this insanity, it is still my instinct to reach out to her in a crisis. Why? I don't know. I'm in therapy trying to figure that out.

I explained to my mom, between sobs, what was happening and that I needed her to drive me to the ER. She responded saying she would have to call my father and fill him in on what was going on. I pleaded with her not to do this, as I was severely embarrassed and was also sitting butt naked in my hallway. She said ""he is your father and I'm calling him"". Then she proceeded to ask me if I had used a sex toy, implying that she thought that was the real reason I had a sudden anal prolapse.

The sex toy question crossed a major line with me for a couple reasons.

1. When I was living with my parents as an adult (in my 20s) she went through my room and found my sex toys and displayed them in my room for my dad to see, and gossiped about me to my dad saying I was probably having threesomes with my boyfriend and his two male roommates and that I was a super slut whore for using sex toys (and especially for using them with my boyfriend). She continued to talk about them over and over despite me saying please do not discuss this with me or about me. She also found my STD test results from the gyno (all negative), which was in an envelope addressed to me and me alone, read them, and wouldn't stop bringing up HIV and how she thought I probably had it even though I tested negative. 
2. I already told her what happened and that it was from pushing too hard.  AND even if it was from a sex toy it would not have made a difference, and I needed to get to the ER immediately (I thought) and she was wasting time asking irrelevant questions.

So. After hearing her ask me if I had used a sex toy in my butt...that was it. I didn't even think. It just came out - much like my prolapsed hemorrhoid. 

I told her to fuck off and hung up.  

I then called my dad and beat her to the punch. My dad surprised me, and was extremely compassionate and kind to me despite the embarrassing circumstances. He drove over to my house and offered to drive me to the ER or to urgent care. With my boyfriend's help though I realized it wasn't an anal prolapse after all and instead is a grade 3 hemorrhoid, so I stayed home. I am using ice and preparation H to try to heal things on my own.

However, because my mom is a narcissist, she is not taking the ""fuck off"" comment lightly. She can't think ""well she was very distressed and freaking out due to the medical crisis and I offended her"". No. All she thinks is ""how dare my own daughter tell me to fuck off"". She told my dad that no one has ever said that to her (quite frankly it was well overdue).  But I am sure I will never hear the end of it and she will be bringing this up for years, just like everything else that ever happens to her.

**TL;DR** got a grade 3 hemorrhoid I mistook for anal prolapse, freaked out, and told my narcissist mother to fuck off when she asked if I had used a sex toy.",TIFU by thinking I had anal prolapse
151,tifu,"So this happened today, actually rather a few minutes ago and I am still furios about my fuck up.

So right now I go to university in Germany, and I am a very punctual type of guy (I know cliché), so naturally I hate being late and always prepare in time but not today.

As usual a friend of mine (who has a car) should pick me up and we drive together to university. So as I go to bed yesterday, I set my alarm half an hour before that, so I could be prepared as usual when he gets me. This is where the fuck up happend.

My alarm clock is really old, I have it since elementary school which was 13 years ago in my case. I never exchanged it cause until now it worked fine, and I didn't wanna let my smartphone be on in the night.

So on my alarm clock there is a button, if you press it the alarm snoozes for exactly 4 minutes. And I know this and I usually do it once just for the feeling to continue sleeping over the alarm. But today it went wrong. Taking the time in perspective to when I set my alarm to and when I woke up I would've had to snooze it 8 fucking times.

So I either smashed the button while being half asleep 8 fucking times because my lazy ass didn't wanna get up or I slept right through my alarm and it has the most annoying sound you can imagine (like a high frequency beep) and even thou that sound is annoying as hell I still kept it because it's hard for me to get used to other alarm clocks and I've tried a few. 

So at one point I just woke up by myself and realized a few moments later what I did half asleep. My alarm clock was silent. It just had given all hope up on waking me and probably refused to do its job any further. I immediately wrote my friend and apologized and explained what happend. 

Now I fear I have broken it and probably have to get a new one. Even though as a result I only skipped uni for a day and made a friend wait for me in the cold car for a while I feel really bad about my fuck up and me being a lazy ass.

152,tifu,"This actually happened when I was a little kid, but I just remembered it today.

One sunny afternoon, my young self decided to make a craft or some shit. I don’t really remember. What I do remember is that it involved the use of scissors, so I went to ask my parents for some. The only scissors my mom had on hand were her crafting scissors and before she gave them to me, she warned me that they were sharp and I should be careful. Cue FU...

After I was done using the scissors for their intended purpose, I decided to test how sharp the blade actually was. I ran the blade across the pad of my index finger and realized it was a bad idea only after the blade got so deep that it started to get stuck. I panicked and pulled the scissors away, but the damage was done. I ran to the bathroom, dripping blood everywhere and quickly grabbed a bunch of toilet paper. I bunched it into a ball around my finger and began applying pressure like I’d always been told to do in a situation like this. After a few seconds I thought I had done enough pressure so I opened the toilet paper to see if I had stopped the bleeding. What I actually saw was that the cut was deep enough that the toilet paper had gotten into it, and now I had a wad of toilet paper stuck inside me. 

The next few minutes were spent digging toilet paper out of my finger while bawling my eyes out. Eventually I decided to get my parents help so I went downstairs and was forced to explain that I had purposely cut myself with scissors to test their sharpness. Thankfully I didn’t need stitches, but I get made fun of by my parents to this day.

So, to start off I am a very mutually moral person; realistic yet, moderately aware of emotional social cues. However there are times where being realistic, with the mental equivalence of a robot, of a may take over. Apparently, this wasn’t a great time for it to take over.

Picture this, freshman year of high school and I got accepted into this program in college. Basically we go to this med school about three times a month to work on this project with actual med students. It was around the first time I met my med student mentors and they were really cool, I liked them a lot. 

Now as we are getting to know each other, one of my mentors mentions that they use to have cancer when they were around my age but they beat it. Being me, I really don’t know how to react to that. What do I say to that? “Wow you’re so strong” “That’s crazy!” “Wow really?” 

No.

“That’s really tough. I’m glad you’re even here. My grandma had cancer and she died.” 

My mentors look at each other as I sat between them, smiling wide, content with my answer. Wow OP, stellar answer you couldn’t have done better!! 

Now, I got home to my mother to tell her about my day and what happened . Eventually it leds up to that encounter. As I say my answer I could see my mother standing, horrified. It was then I realized what I had done.

There was no going back.

Usually after every 2-3 months I travel either to my sisters house (Germany), or visit some new places.Rewinding it to almost a month back, 24th of Dec, I was supposed to travel from Montpellier to Avignon (2 days) then to Frankfurt and finally Paris while returning back to Montpellier. I booked a cheap dormitory with 4 bunk beds in Avignon.I decided to get a tour of the city, with a little mix of booze. I ended up drinking 6-7 shots of ballentine's, roamed around for an hour and then bought one bottle of port wine with a muffin. Now, I dont know about you guys/gals but Wine ,for me, is overwhelming for my taste buds. I reached back my dormitory, found out it is inhabited by 3 more tennants. I had some small talk with them and then decided to open my wine bottle. I gulped down 2 full glasses (whiskey glasses). Next thing I know is, I wake up next morning 6:30 in the morning with a terrific smell. I observed that a girl sleeping on a bunk bed adjacent to me has shifted far away. I immediately get this horrible smell of puke with alcohol.I had no idea when did i puke, or if any of the fellow tenants helped me up while i was throwing up. Got up from my bed, removed the sheets. The whole bed (upper part) was covered in puke. I even managed to get some on the wall and on the downside of the upper bed. I even managed to puke it till where my feet were (now it made sense, why the girl changed her bed).I noticed that all the other 3 people were sleeping like a charm :P.I ended up paying a good amount of money to the owner for the duvet, sheets and cleaning (he initially thought I defecated).

155,tifu,"This happened this past April, I have sufficiently recovered to talk about it now. Some background: every morning during the colder months, I drink hot chocolate (I don't like coffee). And I make my own hot chocolate like my grandma used to make me - on the stove, with sugar, Fry's cocoa powder and milk, nothing else. I work full-time and so Monday to Friday I make my hot chocolate on the stove at home, pour it through a funnel into my trust vintage Thermos (side note - if you want something that actually keeps stuff hot or cold, visit a thrift store and pick one up - mine is one with the glass filler inside and was made in Canada. They are amazing). I get to work an hour later and pour out my still steaming hot chocolate (see note above) into a mug. Because I do this every day for 5 days in a row, I generally just rinse the funnel and leave it sitting on my kitchen countertop for the week.

The FU occurs when, as I'm savouring my delicious warm drink, I feel something in my mouth that isn't the right consistency - something has touched my teeth that seems chewy. Now, in hindsight, the appropriate thing to do is to write it off as something left over from breakfast that came out of my teeth, swallow it, and move on with my life. Unfortunately, it was weird enough that I grabbed a tissue and spit the chewy bit into it - only to discover a brown, used-to-be-crunchy-but-now-mushy spider - drowned and chewed but still intact and obviously a spider. Commence disbelief and freakout. I stared at it for what felt like many minutes, trying to tell myself I was wrong. 

I possibly could have convinced myself that it was just some food that looked like it had 8 legs based on the way I chewed it... but I made a second FU of running to my coworker and asking her what it was, screaming ""It was in my mouth!"". She took one glance and said ""omg, that's a spider, there's mouthwash in the bathroom, go, go go!"". And though I burned my mouth using the mouthwash (the words ""kill it with fire!"" came to me repeatedly and mouthwash was the best/closest option), I could not get the feel of that chewy bit to go away.

Suffice it to say, that day I decided that hot chocolate season was over for the summer, and possibly forever! But I was wrong! When cold enough temperatures hit this fall, I started up my routine again. BUT NOW I do a thorough inspection of funnel and all parts of my thermos before use.

This actually happened a couple days ago..

I left my purse unzipped and in the backseat of our car, as me, my 8 year old and 6 year old went to the beach.   When we got back to the car, I washed off the kiddos and they got in. 
I walk around to get in the driver seat and notice my opened purse and the marijuana gummy canister that I completely forgot was inside!  AND the canister was opened...  I looked at my kids and asked if they ate one and they both said YES!   
Oh fuck.  
Damn they are fast!
I text my sister asking for advice and she just sent back laughing emojis, which helped a little.  They weren’t very high doses of THC: 2.5 mg w/CBD.  

About 1 hour after consumption I asked them if they felt any different, luckily they both said no.  I kept asking every 10 mins for the next couple hours with the same response, No mommy.  They didn’t seem any different except they ATE a ton of food for those next 2 hours and the 8 year old fell asleep super  fast.  Although, we did have a busy couple days.

157,tifu,"For his birthday, I gifted my boyfriend a photo album with some nudes. I like taking them, he likes looking at them and it was really funny to make. 
And I kinda like the fact that he only has these pictures printed out and not on his phone. 

He loved it and was so happy about it that I decided to put more pictures in it.

So over the last months, I regularly took more pictures, edited them nicely with Lightroom and printed them out. The boyfriend was happy, I had fun. 

And I have to be precise, these aren't boring mirror selfies of me naked, these are kinky ones with my in latex and kinky stuff, ball gags and the full wardrobe of sex toys. I always give 100%.

Then, a fellow student of mine asked me if we wanted to share our Adobe Cloud. 
There are a lot of programs that are really helpful, but it's kinda expensive and we're both students, so sharing the cost sounded fair to me!

I changed my password, he logged in and since then, he's using my cloud with me. 
That was a few months ago. 
Still taking nudes and editing them with my cloud. 

What I forgot : Lightroom saves all of the pictures in a gallery. 
A few minutes ago I scrolled down that gallery, searching for a dumb selfie I took a while ago. 

Then I saw some pictures that definitely weren't mine. 

Then it dawned to me. 

I'm able to see the pictures he edits. Because we share the same cloud.

Hi, OP here. Anyways, TIFU by playing with my 3DS. I was playing some Pokemon on my 3DS and started to get bored and really horny. Since I really enjoy C&amp;BT, I decided that my DS stylus would be the perfect match for my penis. And it was! It fit so snug and perfectly up my urethra that I just couldn't resist to take it out, so I wore it for 2 days straight. When the time was right, I decided to take the oen out only to realize it was about 4 inches deep and stuck inside, no matter how much I peed it out. I originally thought it was pretty cool and also posted it to [r/sounding](https://www.reddit.com/r/sounding/) and it got a decent amount of upvotes. Anyway, the removal process was really hard. I tried to pull it out with tweasers but it only pushed the stylus further up my urinary track. I had to go to the emergency room and they performed a 2 hour long surgery, now my penis has a really cool scar!

TLDR; DS stylus got stuck in my urethra, had to gry surgery to remove it.",Tifu I shoved my 3DS stylus in my penis

So here I am, yesterday, enjoying Reddit as you’re all doing now, when I come across a TIFU about someone scratching his balls which resulted in getting one removed, read a bit more in-depth thinking this couldn’t possibly happen to me...

Later that night, I’m in bed, watching Merlin and relaxing before Blue Monday, when I too get an itch down below, bearing in mind by this point I had completely forgot about the post.

Similar to the OP of that post, I too slipped, and knacked the back of my nut. Followed with a ridiculous sharp pain, and then achey balls. Immediately thinking of the thread and thinking, oh no.

Poured myself a whisky and went to bed hoping itd be a distant dream. But no, not too my surprise I awoke feeling like Mike Tyson took a swing on my manhood. Took a shower and everything seemed to die down a bit, no swelling etc so thought I was golden. Off to work I go!

As the day goes on, the pain increases, feel nausea, abdominal pains etc etc, I waddle to A&amp;E after work to get it checked, expecting the worse to come. But it didn’t come.

After waiting a few too many hours and flashing my possession to a few too many Dr, it turns out I just have an infection in the epididymis, which I didn’t really think about until I walked out of A&amp;E, BUT recently every time I’ve ejaculated I’ve held/ pulled my little jewels away from me (better climax, judge me), which must of caused build up or something.

Bizarrely scraping my scrotum was a completely unrelated event to the pain I was enduring (which I still don’t 100% agree, seems way too coincidental), But he gave me some tablets and sent me on my merry way, with my two boys accompanying me.

You can never be too sure gentlemen! When it comes to your things, if something don’t look / feel right go see someone!

161,tifu,"I just realised this a couple of hours.

A couple of years ago my parents bought my grandparents an Amazon Alexa(Echo) as a Christmas gift. It was so they could play some of the music that they liked. They don’t have amazon music so we set up the Echo on our account.

Amazon has had this grouping feature for a while. It allows you to make a multi-room/stereo-like audio setup. So I set up a group in my living room with4 echos. On any Alexa device you can say, play in the living room, and it’ll play the song on all 4 Echos.

Recently Amazon made it so there is this automatically created group called everywhere. Which has all of your Alexa devices in it. We have some Alexa devices in our bedrooms up stairs so when I am alone at home I have begun playing music in the everywhere group.

Occasionally the music has randomly stopped. I couldn’t work it out till now but when I’ve said play everywhere I’ve actually been playing my very loud music in my grandparents house. But here the kicker. I live in Australia and my grandparents are in the US, so when I’ve been playing my music it has been around 12-3am their time. Oops.

So now I’m like where the heck are they coming from, the couch? The side table?

164,tifu,"Obligatory this actually happened a little over a year ago, and throwaway because I don't want people on my main account to know what I do for a living.

So, I work for the TSA, and have for a few years now. It's a good job overall. I'm underpaid, but the benefits are nice, and I get overtime when I want it.

A little over a year ago, during the week leading up to Christmas, we had some really bad weather that delayed all the flights. I volunteered to stay late so that my coworkers could go home to their families. Most of the work was done anyway, so it was mostly just standing around waiting for the odd latecomer

I was working the AIT (the space tube thingy), when three passengers came up together, a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman, and a teenage boy. I figure it's a family traveling together for the holidays, and go about my work.

Mom goes through, all is fine. Dad goes through, all is fine.

Kid comes up, I get a good look at him. Hoodie, sweatpants, shortish hair, smooth face. I figure he's about 13, maybe 14.

I hit the button, direct him to wait with me for a moment, and then gesture to the screen, which lit up on his chest area.

I tell him that I have to pat that area down. He's a little nervous, I figure that because he's so young, this is probably his first time getting a pat down, but he says okay, and I start the patdown.

I do the left side of the chest, and feel some moob, which catches me off guard because he didn't look chubby at all.

I move to the right side of the chest, read what's on the hoodie, and it all clicks at once. The hoodie has the name of the local college on it. This is an adult, not a child. He's not wearing sweatpants, \*she\* is wearing yoga pants. She doesn't even know the couple that just came through.

I look at her face, which is bright red, my hand is still on her boob, and I pull it back like I just got bit by a snake.

I immediately call for my supervisor, who comes over and asks what's wrong, and I explain the situation to her.

My supervisor covers her mouth, and at first I thought she was absolutely mortified, but then I realized she's trying not to laugh.

She takes a minute to pull herself together, tells me to go take a break, and finishes screening the passenger herself.

Once that was done, I apologize to the passenger, she tells me it's fine, that it wasn't the first time she was mistaken for a boy, and she probably should have said something before I started touching her. I leave her alone, and go talk to my supervisor to figure out exactly how fired I am.

She tells me to calm down, that it was just an honest mistake, and that she has my back if the passenger files an official complaint, but that probably won't happen, and I shouldn't be worried.

That reassured me a little, but I still groped a woman and ruined Christmas, so I feel like an absolute monster.

I swallow my shame, and finish my shift, then I go into the airport proper to find some food, because I just finished a twelve hour shift and there's no way I have the energy to cook dinner.

I saw my hapless victim sitting at her gate, waiting for her flight. I went up to her to apologize again, and saw that the flight had been delayed until morning (it was about eleven at night).

I apologize again, she says it's fine, and I ask her if she's planning to stay the whole night. She says she has to, all the hotels in the area are book.

I tell her that I'm getting some dinner, and offer to get her some food as well. After all, I already got to second base, I think it's only fair that I buy her dinner.

She agrees, and we go to one of the restaurants that is open late, get some food, and start eating.

She said she gets mistaken for a boy a lot, and it's not a big deal. I told her about how I had long hair and no beard in college, and at the gym people would frequently walk into the men's bathroom, see me, and do a double take to make sure they didn't walk into the ladies' room.

She laughed, and we ended up talking for a few hours, before I finally told her that I had to get home, and apologized again for the accidental molestation.

She said that all is forgiven, if I promise to take her on a real date when she gets back.

I agreed, she gave me her phone number, and I went home, and immediately started texting her. We kept talking until her flight finally left, and when she got back I picked her up at the airport, and a few days later took her on that date that I promised her.

We just celebrated our one year anniversary.

She has long hair now.

On Saturday, my manager asked me to come into work early because her son was sick so I said sure.

I get there and I see that none of the work for the day was done. She tells me to do a million things, most of it including her work.

I'm kind of upset but get started right away, so that I can finish everything on time. Before she leaves, she explains that it was a load day, so there was a U-boat full of product on the floor. She told me to put it in the freezer before I go home, and if there's no room for it, to make room.

There was no room in the freezer so I spent an hour or so condensing boxes and what not to make room in the freezer.

There still wasn't enough room in the freezer, so i decided to just leave the u-boat out, as it was just stuff for the tables so nothing bad would happen to the product, I had seen them do it before.

The next day I come into work, my manager tells me that there's no French bread because I left it on the u-boat that didn't get put away. All dough needs to be kept frozen or else it'll slowly proof and become trash.

I felt bad but didn't think it was too big of a deal.

Today, I get called into the office by the store director after work. As soon as I walk into the office she goes, ""$28,000.""

I stared at her blankly, as I was confused.

She continues, ""$28,000. That's how much you owe me. That's how much dough you ruined when you left the U-boat out""

I was so surprised. I had no idea that there was any other dough on that u-boat besides the French bread, let alone $28,000 worth.

I got a little teary eyed and tried explaining to her that I had no Idea, I thought the manager would put the dough away first thing right away.

She kind of toned down and tried to explain how it wasn't only my fault, that she wasn't mad or upset, and that I just needed to be more careful next time, but her words and way she first looked at me still stuck in my head.

For Context: So I am a person who is psychologically really unstable, and I have several disorders. (Shizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety...)

So she knew kind of all of my problems, especially about my despression and my (uncontrollable) urge to kill myself. I even was in a psychatry ealier this year. (Which made whole shit worse)

So after 4 years of knowing, the close friendship started kicking almost one year earlier, we finally met first. It was one of my best weeks of the last year, we had some great time. But it was always kinda weird, because she always has my problems in mind and they really bothered her, but she didn't really dare speaking, because of her being scared to reject me. (At least I reckon)

2 Weeks after visiting her I get on a scout camp. And where I live, we really don't like phones on these camps. I needed to bring mine because I am one of the leaders, to call the parents if something happens or to stay in touch with other leaders during activities in cities nearby. 

So for some dumb reason I forgot telling her that I'll go to the camp and so I wouldn't contact her the next two weeks. So I just did not write her.

173,tifu,"For a little context, I have a step-in shower (i.e. no tub), but it’s pretty close to the size of a standard shower/tub combo, so my shower curtain is a standard size. 

Lately, I’ve had an issue with some water getting on my floor (despite the curtain and liner being plenty long enough), because the curtain and liner get “blown” into the shower when the water is on, so when it was time to buy a new liner today, I figured maybe the one marked “medium weight” would be better than the “light weight” kind that I always buy. I assumed it was called a shower *stall* liner because it was heavier and made for step-in showers. 

I was very wrong.

I get home from the store and throw out the old, gross liner. I open up the new one and notice the weights in the bottom. “This is going to be so much better,” I (stupidly) think to myself. I get to work putting the new liner up on the hooks with the curtain. Nothing seems weird until I get to the last few hooks and run out of liner. First, I think I missed some holes...I didn’t. Then, I’m a little peeved thinking the thing was defective. Then, finally, I come the realization that I’m a dumbass and didn’t think to compare the sizes at the store. 

But now I’m in too deep. I can’t take the thing back at this point, and I certainly don’t want to have wasted $6 on it. I figure out that I can just adjust the liner so there’s one hook on either side, and the liner still covers the width of the shower. “It’s not ideal, but it will still work,” I think out loud. 

Then comes time to take a shower. I can’t wait to not have a gross shower liner cramping my space. I open the curtain and the liner looks longer than the last one, but that can only help the “water on the floor” problem, right? Wrong. I step in, close the curtain, and proceed to slip because the liner is covering at least 6” of my shower floor. Now I’m beyond annoyed, but the curtain rod is fairly easy to adjust so I get to work moving the whole thing up (keep in mind that I’m wasting precious hot water at this point). 

I finally get the curtain moved up enough to not be a safety hazard, and, you guys. The damn. thing. starts. crowding. me. So now I’m out of hot water, my new shower liner that I thought would be better is filling up half of my shower, and since I had to raise the curtain rod so high, my regular curtain is a nice, awkward 7” off the floor. 

TL;DR I bought a new shower liner thinking the heavier weight would help my crowding issue (it didn’t), I got the wrong size by accident, and since I had to raise the curtain rod half a foot to accommodate the new, longer liner, I will now be reminded of my mistake every time I use the bathroom.",TIFU by accidentally buying a shower *stall* curtain liner instead of a standard one

Now comes the fuckup: I found my ideal weights for shoulder presses to be 10 kg and could do 2x15 repetitions. But then on the next visit I suddenly only managed to do 2x10. The amount of repetitions I was able to manage fluctuated greatly between visits.

Also I could never really increase the weights on the next visit because I could only add 5 kg intervals (about 10 pounds) on those machines and that was too much for me.

Yesterday I talked with a friend who goes to another gym and complained about the 5 kg intervals. He told me that there's a 2.5 kg thing you can put on the weights to make it easier and I should ask the gym personnel if they have something like this.

Today I looked closer at the weights to look for any place to put the extra weights on and noticed a new thing: It has a little yellow and black thing on top of the weights that says ""5 lbs | 2.5 kg"" with ON and OFF written behind it. [Here's a picture of it.](https://i.imgur.com/hF2qLZX.png)

I played around with it and was able to move it back and forth, to the ON and OFF state. That's when I noticed that this is the 2.5 kg extra weight my friend was talking about. It's on almost every machine in the gym!

All this time I used a random amount of weights because one time it was set to ON and another time it was set to OFF. When I confronted the trainer on why he didn't tell me, he just said ""2.5 kg is nothing, you should barely feel a difference"".

TL;DR I didn't notice an optional 2.5 kg weight on all gym equipment which was randomly activated by other people. This caused me to perform well on one gym visit and bad on another and I could never up the weights.",TIFU by not noticing optional weights in the gym
177,tifu,"So, it starts as of last night, I was pretty tired after watching the football games and doing work, so i went to bed decently early at 10 pm (earlier than my normal of midnight/1am). I should also mention I am not a morning person, anything before 9 am can be a struggle to do it more than once a week. And having to be at work 7:45 am can be hard.

I sometimes also wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and/or get a drink of water. So last night at about 4:17 am I woke up and me being really groggy in the morning from just barely waking up I look at the time on my phone and for some fuck all reason my brain kicks into panic mode thinking I'm late for work (having to be at work at 7:45).

So I'm sitting panicking for a solid 30 seconds thinking I have to call my boss and tell him I'm sorry for being late I missed my morning alarms. But then I realize that it's really 4 am... but my adrenaline was blasting through my veins like a robber just busted through my door in the middle of the night. 

So I figured I would go back to sleep and I get up for work on time and get there before we open at 8. My boss then calls me into his office and was like ""why the hell did you call me at 4 am"" and in sitting there confused like I didnt call you. So he shows me his call logs and there it is at 4 am I called him. I check mine and that really confirms I did call him. But I'm sitting there confused, and tell him the story.

In the end we got a good laugh out of the story and went to work like nothing happened.

TL;DR: This morning at 4am I woke up in a panic thinking I was late for work. Realized I wasn't so went back to bed. Got to work at 7:45 and my manager asked me why I called him at 4am, and me confused told him what happened, we laughed.",TIFU by calling my boss at 4am

Oftentimes I'll mosey on into the room and lay next to her and hold her while I say like ""you're my best friend"" or something similar before getting going back to the the living room

She's usually fast asleep so she doesn't hear me but that's fine, sometimes it's easier to be sweet when the other person can't hear you. 

At around 4AM I went into the room to spoon her real quick. So as I lay down my brain decides to be a complete moron, instead of something sweet I randomly blurted out

*""It's RAPE time...""*

I don't know where that line came from...it wouldn't have been a big deal except this time my gf wasn't asleep and she told me I was creepy as fuck and weird. I was embarrassed that I said something so stupid so I immediately got up and left the room... And now I'm wondering when I can I go to bed.

Obligitory this was sent yesterday, but I only realised I fucked up this morning.

My girlfriend and I are long distance, I'm in Houston and she's in Dubai. There's a whole other story about why she can't be here with me, but it's irrelevant to this story.

So I sent here this [screencap](https://i.redd.it/0yj1jcb5anb41.jpg) in the Texas afternoon yesterday (while she was sleeping) and a few lines about how creepy guys were and asked if she ever had any clever responses to creepy guys (we met on tinder when I lived in Dubai about a year ago)... I thought it was a funny exchange but, naturally, vastly underestimated how insecure she is.

This morning I woke up to a message saying she was disgusted and felt sick knowing that I was on tinder and texting girls, clearly thinking that I was the creeper in this exchange. She went on to say she needed time to think and would block me if I try to call her. I sent here the screencap link and explained that it was from reddit however my messages have been left unread.

She clearly doesn't trust me. I think this relationship with the first woman I've loved in more than 5 years has just gone terminal over a stupid meme. I'll never stop being amazed at my own stupidity.

TL;DR
I sent a meme without providing proper context and fucked my relationship up, probably beyond repair.

Update:
I managed to get tell her, through here sister that the screen shit was on reddit and we had a bit of a back and forth where she basically said she was harsh and over reacted but that she wasn't sorry.  I tried to articulate how hurt I was that she doesn't trust me but I guess we have different ideas of what trust is.

Through the conversation I thought that she was looking for an excuse to end it, and she said that I was trying to correl her into ending it so she'd be the bad guy (saying I was gaslighting her in a roundabout way).  We said we'd talk again when we've cooled down, but I don't know if we will.

As it is, the whole thing is untenable.  I think it has been for some time, but I had my head in the sand and have been walking on eggshells to maintain it.",TIFU by sending my girlfriend a screen cap from r/tinder

Obligatory this happened yesterday. 

me and a mate entered a discount bread store looking for stale Foccacia that he needed for a recipe for dinner he was making for his in-laws that night. We had looked all over the district for this bread but to no avail. So we thought why not try the great outlet store, that’s where all the overstock stale bread goes anyways. So we entered the store and I do admit, we had smoked some devil’s lettuce prior to. And We had consumed a few beers between the two of us. 
Anyways we enter the store and I, presumably louder than I realized, said *yelled* LET’S GET THIS BREAD and the lone worker takes cover behind the desk immediately and calls 000. She was so quiet in doing so, we thought she was just bending down reaching for something behind the desk. Much to our surprise, we had just found some rather stale focaccia when the police stormed in and my friend and I were both ordered to the ground and cuffed. They told us we were being detained for attempted robbery. 

After a while we were able to explain what happened, and they told us they could arrest us for public intoxication but if we would leave and never come to the bread outlet again, they would let us go. 

TL;DR: rather intoxicated, mate and I were looking for a specific bread, entered the discount bread outlet and I yelled let’s get this bread, and the inexperienced cashier took it as a robbery threat and called the police which ended in us being banned from the store",TIFU when I *almost* robbed a bread store
181,tifu,"Hi Reddit! This literally happened about half an hour and I'm still lowkey traumatised so forgive me for omitting any details.

So today my boyfriend and I were hanging out at his place and we got into an argument so he drove me home at about 11pm. We tend to solve a lot of our problems on the drive home or we'll park outside my house and just try and talk things out (in hindsight, stupid thing to do). For context, I live across the road from a bunch of factories. I was crying and visibly upset and I just didn't want to deal with my parents asking if we're okay etc. so we sat in the car just talking for about half an hour. We solve everything, I'm feeling better and we get ready for him to walk me to my door so we can go inside. 

Just as we are ready, a car stops in front of us on the other side of the road (in front of my house), just in the middle of the lane. Doesn't pull over, cars are having to enter the other lane to get around, headlights still on blinding us. We thought maybe the car was trying to reverse back into the street behind it (which would be weird anyway) or that they were going to park in front of my house (which doesn't have a parking space). My boyfriend and I are very creeped out by this, genuinely just confused as to what is going on, so we decide to drive around the block. Maybe the person just wanted to take our spot or something? We come back around, car's still there. We go around the block again, car's still there. So we decide to drive around a bit and through the side streets around my house. We're both very freaked out and contemplating me just staying at his for the night since I'm a bit spooked. 

For context, there had been police around my streets over the past couple of days, which is strange for my area. A couple nights ago when I was out wirh friends, my dad mentioned in the morning that he thought he heard gunshots. I thought nothing of it, my dad never mentioned it again.As we're driving, my boyfriend says to me, ""that car is following us."" This is when I started really freaking out. I wasn't even looking behind us and once I did, I realised my boyfriend was right.

We continue to drive around the side streets and eventually are able to lose the car following us, my boyfriend calls his dad asking him what to do and we decide to just wait a bit at a Macca's about 10 minutes away. We get there, I call my dad, who's home, and let him know what's going on. My boyfriend and I figure if the car didn't follow us to Macca's we were safe. So we begin the drive back, still freaking out and trying to plan how the safest way to go about this would be. Just as we pull up on the side of the road in front of my house this time, we see three tall men standing on the corner of my street.

We were freaking out. It's extremely odd for people to be on the streets around my neighbourhood late at night. This was where the fear really kicked in, I literally thought we were going to die if we stopped the car. Then I realise one of them is my dad, and I've never felt so much relief in my entire life. My boyfriend and I walk up to the three of them and the other two men introduce themselves as the owners of the factory next door.

The gunshots my dad had heard were from a drive by targeting their factory executed by the Turkish mafia (in the owner's words). The police were investigating, which is why there were so many the past couple of days. They explain that they saw my boyfriend's car parked outside their factory on their security cameras and had called the police, but had come to investigate themselves. They told us they were following us because we kept circling back around. The owners turned out to be absolutely lovely people, albeit extremely intimidating at first glance on a street corner in the dark. They shared stories about their run ins with the Italian and the Turkish mafia, their struggles establish the business and the devastation they faced when their previous factory burnt down. We all laughed about what happened, and my boyfriend and I apologised for the inconvenience and the scare that we caused them.

Needless to say, my boyfriend and I will be having our arguments inside my house from now on

tldr; Me crying in my boyfriend's car lead some factory owners to call the police on us thinking we were part of the Turkish mafia.

182,tifu,"Okay so, obligatory this happened a while back and I'm also white as fuck.

So I went to Build-a-Bear with my girlfriend so we could make eachother a stuffed animal. We have a history of naming them by very odd names that give them a certain attribute. Think a Snorlax named Bartholomew because he's chunky and Bartholomew gives me chunky vibes.

I ended up getting her a moose and was kiiiind of lost on a name. She named the one for me Speedwagon, and I just kind of sat there thinking before I finally found out the name I wanted.

The entire cashier staff was comprised of black folk who I sincerely apologize to. They printed out the certificate and just STARE at the name I chose while my girlfriend gives me a weird look. Nidhoggr the moose had been born, and I am now known as the man who named a moose a variation of the n word at that store.

I tried frantically to explain Norse mythology to my girlfriend who is dying laughing while the cashier is visibly uncomfortable looking at the paper. We ended up paying and walking out, but now everyone makes fun of me for naming a moose the ""N word"".

183,tifu,"This happened like five years ago but even saying ""remember that time we..."" to my partner is enough to make him cringe right along with me.   


So, little backstory... my partner and I used to LARP ( Live-Action Role Play, don't knock it till you've tried it). This is actually where we met, so it held special meaning to us. The massive event where we met (it has long weekends where about 700 people attend) also included my ex-boyfriend and when my character died, rather than starting a new one, we just stopped going. We wanted to give it another try though, so we signed up for a much smaller event. Maybe like 50 people max. It had a few people in it we knew but it was mostly strangers.  


The weekend started off horrible, before we even got there our car broke down and I had managed to sink THIGH-DEEP into a puddle of mud. I wish I had recognised this as some kind of pre-karma and cancelled the weekend, but no. We went on and managed to enjoy ourselves despite the rough start.  


So now for the fuck up. An older guy was dressed up like a barbarian. Great outfit, amazing face-paint, the works. He'd even been grumbling throughout the entire event and never broke character even in down-time. I thought that was pretty amazing and commended him on it. He responded with another grumble, which made my partner and me laugh. We'd already been in a giddy mood because of something I can't really remember. Then I said ""The event is over now, you can talk normally again!"" and then proceeded to laugh more... as we thought he was joking. He never spoke and simply walked off. We didn't think much off it, figuring he was just one of the more hard-core players that didn't break character whilst in their costume.   


Cue us walking back to the rooms to pack up our bags when we overheard someone talking about the Barbarian. Being social, we joined in the conversation... We then got to hear about how this man had a stroke a year or two prior and had to re-learn how to speak. How this was the first event he attended again because he loved LARP so much. It was organised by his wife and children. I had unintentionally mocked this man and then LAUGHED at him.   


I felt the blood draining out of my face, looked at my equally pale partner in absolute horror and with a few words we excused ourselves. We immediately went back to our room, packed at record speed and removed ourselves from these nice people's lives as quickly as we physically could. Should we have apologised rather than run off in absolute shame? Yes, definitely. Were we too much of a coward to face this poor man? Yes, definitely. Does this still keep me up at night? Yes, definitely.

184,tifu,"Yesterday my folks invited my wife and I over for an early dinner, and as their daughter and someone who just barely squeaks into the Millenial age range, I of course had to pay the Technology Tax once dessert was over.

Mom had gotten a new Kindle Fire for Christmas and wanted me to help her fix some things: turn off the noisy alerts at night, connect it to the printer, and show her where the list of free books was, etc.

After the normal series of nonsense where I had to decode MomTech into what was actually possible on the Fire (including a length foray in which, at her request, she wanted me to add her to my dad's Household so she could access his books, only to discover ten minutes later that they SHARE THE SAME AMAZON ACCOUNT) we got to the part where I could show her where the free books were.

At first, I was just going to show her how to sort by price so all the $0.00 books in the public domain would be at the top, but then I noticed that the account had Kindle Unlimited activated. So I clicked on there to show her how to borrow books from that library.

Underneath the account details and the membership plan information was the list of borrowed books. At the top was ""What If?"" by Randall Munroe. 'Good taste, Dad!' I thought, and explained to my mom that this was where she could see what was currently borrowed, as well as a history of the previously borrowed books.

I scrolled down to show her the history, and right under What If? was:

**Smolder: A Military Reverse Harem Romance**

The cover was the stereotypical romance novel cover: a woman caressing a handsome shirtless man, but behind them was a second handsome shirtless man and a third wearing a gas mask and military shoulder straps (which I would personally worry about chafing since he was, like the others, shirtless).

My wife and I shared a giggle since, as total nerds, we both immediately knew what ""Reverse Harem"" was, and, well, as far as erotica goes, it wasn't anything too disturbing. Dad was allowed to read a trashy novel now and then.

I scrolled down more, expecting to see a normal mix of books, and to my horror, book after book, a trend started appearing.

* **Saving Savannah - A Reverse Harem Romance**

* **Battlefield Ukraine: Book One of the Red Storm Series** (c-c-c-combo breaker)
* **Shared by Her Two Cowboys: A MFM Western Menage Romance** (aaaand we're back)
* etc etc etc

Dad has been paying for Kindle Unlimited since 2017, and in that time, he has literally borrowed at least 4 of these kinds of books a month, and very rarely anything else.

(if you're wondering, I didn't scroll quite that far in front of my mom and wife. I snuck into their account this morning since their password was super easy to remember, and there was no way I could do this writeup without sharing these awesome book titles)

At first, I was like ""Oh, look, the date for this is December 25. I bet my brother snuck onto your account to play a prank.""

But Mom pointed out he'd spent Christmas with the inlaws and hadn't visited until a few days later.

Then I said, ""Oh, it's probably just one of those recommendation lists. Romance is the most popular genre on Kindle."" And then I quickly went back to the top, showed her where to access the Unlimited Library, made my excuses, and we GOT THE FUCK OUT OF THERE.

For those of you that don't know, Charles Stanley is a Southern Bapitist pastor that has a TV ministry airing every morning.

I work at a motel as a front desk receptionist, and 11:00am is when we start knocking doors for late checkouts. I'm nearing the end of my list and I get to a door that sounds like someone is talking inside, I continuously knock on the door saying ""Front desk, sir, it's past check out time."" 

As I'm standing outside of the door, I hear him reading Bible verses and I decide to run a few more doors and pull sheets for about ten more minutes before I knock again, as I didn't want to interrupt someone's prayer (just a courtesy). 

I knock on his door again and he continues to speak, but he doesn't reply directly, (which isn't unusual when someone refuses to vacate the room). After waiting a few more minutes I announce that I'm coming in. 

I slide my card, unlock the door, and stand in the doorway saying - ""Sir, you have to go! It's thirty minutes past check out and you WILL incur a late fee if you decide to stay any longer!""

Obligatory  this didn’t happen today. Happened about 17 years ago when I was still a wee lad. I don’t have many interesting stories so I had to reach deep back in to my uneventful life for this one. Our local church would organize various activities for the teens in the Parrish. Not the fuck up you’re  thinking of. One of the activities they arranged pretty frequently in the spring and summer was a harbor cruise. It wasn’t just my church but other churches as well on one of the regularly scheduled harbor cruises. We all thought we would meet girls, make out with them and have a night  of adventure. I never got so much as hug but the effort seemed worthwhile at the time. Some of the other kids, who at the time, were much more awesome than I was would also sneak booze aboard. It may have my been my first dose of liquid courage that night. I remember blink 182s all the small  things was blaring across the deck. There was a blur of white kids jumping up and down in what we may have considered dancing at the time. I  saw a friend of mine standing with another group of kids. I walked up and in a haze of pop punk, revelry and cheap vodka I decided to smack him right in the face. Not typical behavior for me, but fuck it, I was out for a good time and it seemed like it would be an enjoyable thing to do. I reared  back and hit him with an open hand square across the cheek. Even in  hindsight the smack itself was quite satisfying. The prroblem is that it wasn’t my friend. I tried to explain the confusion and misunderstanding but ended up getting in to a fight that I lost and the coast guard was called. I was taken back to the pier by the coast guard and held until my dad showed up to get me. Oddly enough I wasn’t banned from future  church functions. My dad, in his infinite wisdom, was upset that I lost the fight not the fact I got in to one.

I work at a particular grocery store that has a particular national coffee chain kiosk in it.  I work as a cashier, and man the self check outs (SCOs) right next to this kiosk.  I know the manager of the kiosk very well (read: we're dating) and on this day he was off.

There was one barista in the kiosk and she got about 12 customers at once and more and more started showing up.  I had no one in my department, and I seem to remember something about the store being a united front, so I step over and take orders while she made them (nothing I haven't done before).  I wasn't doing anything with the food/drink, if someone got a pastry item or sandwich, I wrote what they got on the cup and moved on.

My direct manager came up in line and yelled at me in front of everyone for ""abandoning"" my post, the post that was 10 feet away and I could clearly see had one person at it, a regular who knew what he was doing.  I apologized and left the register and stood at my position and watched the customer.  The people in the line were now yelling at my manager because they now had to wait even longer for their drinks so I pull my phone out and text the kiosk manager to come in.  

My manager runs over and starts yelling at me again for taking my phone out when there's customers (only in the kiosk, by the way. Mr. Regular left a few minutes ago at this point).

So in my panic, I go for the very back of the box. I didn't do an exceptional job at hiding my switch in direction, so K sees and asks why I went for the back cookie because it was weird. Me, being me and already panicking, cannot lie. I can lie if I'm fairly calm, but I'm sitting next to my crush (who rejected me later that day, btw), everyone is looking at me now, I have a cookie in my mouth; it's not looking good.

I blurt out the truth: ""I didn't want to touch your hand.""

Oh boy.

Here we go.

K proceeded to ask me why it would be weird (I didn't know) and if he thought I would get germs or something from him. By now the entire table was cracking up. I was trying to laugh, but I was also crying. I think most people thought I was crying with laughter, but in truth, I was pretty embarrassed as I *was* in fairly close proximity to my crush.

The icing on the cake is when K takes my friend's hand and then jumps back like he shocked her and says something along the lines of ""Oh no! I've contracted a deadly disease!"" He even jumped out of his chair. By this point, I wanted to shrivel up and go home, but nobody was picking up on the fact that maybe I wasn't crying with happiness.

This will definitely be going in my top ten embarrassing moments.

192,tifu,"Alright so here’s the deal, this happened 30 min ago. Sorry for another sex related tifu, but hot damn I’m embarrassed. 

Like any young male adult, I have mastered the art of never getting caught choking the chicken. Now that I have a girlf, things got more difficult. She is vocal, that’s what gets her goin’. After some foreplay, I sling on the ole dick sock. Naturally, I get thrustin’ and I grunt with my inner barbarian to really make that oyster glisten. So, I didn’t hear my older brother walk in. As I’m pile driving away, I hear some clothes get dropped on the far side of the room away from the door. I ceased my destruction to see him skrrrt out of my room. He’s gone, I continue because I’m loving it. After I busted a nut an extremely long 2 min in (recall I’m losing my virginity here), my girlfriend gets super embarrassed and profusely apologizes. She is now in tears because she is embarrassed and feels as if my brother will judge her to no end. 

To escape all further contact with him and save us both some embarrassment, I have driven my girlfriend to the pharmacy to buy her some planB. Not because I did it raw, but because I’m a big fat pussy who is afraid of children at the ripe age of 20.

193,tifu,"This happened today. We decided to go out and enjoy some sun at the beach as a family. My 16 month old daughter was really enjoying the day and was having fun playing in the sand and running around. 

As cautious parents, we were always running along with her so that she does not hurt herself. There was a concrete walkway from the beach to the shower area. My daughter was walking in front and I was following here closely behind. She suddenly tripped and I saw her about to fall face down on the concrete floor. My father instinct kicked in and I quickly grabbed her left arm quickly. I felt her arm twist and she cried right away and that’s when I realized I messed something up. She stopped moving her left arm and she would start crying when we try to move her arm. We kind of knew it was either the elbow or the shoulder. I was really mad about myself for doing that to my daughter.

We knew that we had to get her to emergency right away because it was a Sunday and our pediatrician was not reachable. I drove 40 minutes from the beach to the nearest children’s hospital emergency. I was feeling bad about myself for not taking care of my daughter throughout the drive. My wife was trying to keep me calm because I was driving and wanted to make sure we get to the hospital safely.


We reached the emergency and we were the only ones there. The staff was trying to get details about the injury and details about patient and insurance and I was stammering with my responses because of all that stress. I finally filled up all the paper work and a nurse called us in right away. My daughter did not like the emergency room environment and started crying when the nurse was getting all the vitals.

We went into the examination room and a doctor came in right away. The doctor told us that it was Nursemaid's elbow and is a common injury with kids up to 4 years. She told us that it has to be put back into the right position. Since she was a resident, she had to bring in the attending physician to supervise when she is setting the elbow. The doctor popped back my daughters dislocated elbow back to its original location. I said popped because we heard the popping sound and myself and wife cried. My daughter cried and then quickly used her left arm to grab my wife. The doctor told us that was good sign because she used her arm by herself.

My daughter cried for like 5 minutes and then she calmed down. She started to use her arm now and we were relieved again. They monitored her heartbeat for 10 minutes and discharged us saying that we are good to go. We came back home and my daughter started playing and was back to her normal self. We went through so much emotions and trauma within that 3 hours as parents. We swore to each other that we will be very very careful with our daughter going forward.

194,tifu,"This is happening right now. I got my nipples pierced about a month ago and the bar was just the perfect size, if my nipples were a little smaller. So, all had been going OK, on and off anyway. Until today, when I didn't check on them and one of my nipples swallowed one side of the barbell and decided it wanted to keep it forever. The skin grew back too much for me to push it through, because it was yesterday when I last checked on them.
While trying to push it through, the ball CAME OFF THE MOTHERFUCKING BAR. I tried for an hour to fish the bastard out with no success. So here I am in the ER.

The Dr just told me he is going to numb it and try to get it out but if he can't, he is going to send me to a breast surgeon, because he doesn't want to cause any damage to my mammary glands or mess with sensation.

We wanted to watch the new 1917 movie which looks good, but couldn't due to my busy schedule and lots of tests. Today I was finally free to watch it with him so we looked at the cinema's website and saw that theres a projection at 18:20 so we said that we should definitely go to it 


Little time passed and i was at my room chilling, then my father comes in and said ""why  didnt you wake me up?"" I asked ""why?""

197,tifu,"This started back on the 26th of December with my 8th back surgery. Surgery went fine, felt good and they sent me home from the hospital. I started following all my instructions given to me to prevent constipation. Went a few times, didn't think much of it. Wasn't in any major discomfort. 

Week after surgery I started having some issues which after a week of testing ended up showing that my T7 vertebrae had cracked and the screw had come out. They scheduled emergency surgery few days later. Before surgery they had me drink a bunch of laxatives and softeners to make sure I was cleaned out. I went a little and on with the surgery. After they decided that I should have a custom brace made to support my upper back to prevent any more issues. To do they use a 3D scanner to scan your body and a molding machine. Got my brace and they sent me home from the hospital.

Three days later I just felt like crap and it finally dawned on me that I hadn't really gone number 2 in more than 14 days except for a tiny bit before surgery. Downed some more laxatives and hoped for the best. 18 hours later nothing. Getting a little worried, I downed some mirlax and waited a little more. Finally I started to feel like I had to go. What followed was 5 hours of nothing but going to the bathroom. Pure solid concrete was coming out. Hunk after hunk after hunk. I weighed 205 this morning, I am now around 190. 15lbs of impacted, solid, of you know what. 

I go to put my brace back on. The custom made, probably very expensive brace that is basically holding me together at the moment. Pull the straps, they get to the end and the brace is still loose. Try readjusting but nothing. The brace is now super loose on me and doesn't support my back at all. I was so backed up that it was adding 5""+ to my waist. Tomorrow I have to find out if I can get a new one or how this will work. Not even sure if my insurance will pay for a 2nd. But on the up side I guess, I feel a thousand times better!

Anyway, I began playing dead as my grandma tried various things to wake me up. Finally after like 20 minute session of waking up she gave up and went to her room. I stood up and walked to her with a smile and tried to tell something funny as usual, but I saw her pretty bummed out and almost crying. Then she reminded me that her husband died because of heart attack during sleep.
I totally forgot about that and I was pretty angry at myself, so I did everything to make it up for her, and spend the next half hour trying to cheer her up.

My hand slips every once in a while but I normally stop it before it hits too deep. So when it slipped I felt a little prick and nothing else so I thought it was nothing but then I feel a numbness in my hand and look over and see an inch long cut that was just absolutely gushing with blood so I held my hand over it so I didn’t bleed all over the floor and made my way to the bathroom. I held my hand over the sink for a bit thinking it would just stop bleeding and I’d just put something over it to bandage it. Then after about 30 minutes of just constant bleeding (it wasn’t much blood at a time but I bleed a huge amount over that time) I yelled for my dad and he came in and just told me that we needed to go to the ER. We hopped in and my hand was numb already so I didn’t feel anything at all, like stitches, the cut itself or the shot that they used to make sure it was numb. I ended up getting 5 stitches and it turns out I severed a nerve. It’s like an 80% chance that it’ll heal and I’ll regain feeling.

200,tifu,"Oh boy, I'm not entirely sure how to tell this story. Not even sure if it's a good idea to tell it. But I need to get it off my chest. 

So this f-up didn't happen today, but ten years ago back when I was a 15 year old in high school. 

It was a christian high school. That meant that most of the students were teenagers who were horny and confused but had absolutely no sex education besides abstinence. As if that ever worked. Many other teenagers that were in my situation had INTERNET. So while there were many who were not having sex (yet,) you better believe they were consuming pornographic material like it was no one's business. 

Not liking videos or reading and being southeast asia, my go to smut was hentai/ecchi manga (graphic novels) from Japan. While looking for some fuel for wet dreams,  in my search I found some mangas that were less ecchi/hentai more fan service with actually great plots.

I had a classmate (who I will call EF for ex-friend because I no longer associate with him for reasons that will become clearer later.) This classmate of mine loved fan service but I've never known him to appreciate a good story. This annoyed me because I had a friend who liked manga but didn't like the same mangas as me. 

Was it too much to ask for a friend with common interest so I can talk to them about it?

So thinking, I could get him to like something I also liked I showed him the fan service w/ plot manga while basically saying ""hey you, consume better content."" Idk why it was so important to me, but it was. He didn't want to at first but I said there's a full frontal scene in the later chapters and that got him interested. 

After he finished it I asked him what he thought. He said the story was interesting but he didn't really care and he basically only read it for boobs. For some reason, I got offended. Since it was ten years ago I don't really remember the dialogue but this was the gist of it. 

OP: This had a great story AND great art (read as fanservice)! And you still didn't like it?

EF: The art wasn't that good.

OP: Yes it was!

EF:  \[another, smuttier, manga\] was better.

OP: But the story sucked!

EF: Yeah well you can't have both great art (again read as sexually explicit drawings) *and* a good story.

I took that as a challenge. Over the course of months, I started looking for japanese graphic porn with good plots. Now I'll admit while I was doing this, I did think it was kinda weird that I was so invested in finding content that EF liked and that also passed my quality standards.  But I chalked it up to loneliness and just wanting someone to talk to. 

Anyways this is just a long winded way of saying that I eventually got around to showing him loli and shouta ai content which are mangas of teenagers around the age of 12 to 16 having sex. Sometimes with each other and sometimes with adults. 

Now before you crucify 15 year old me for consuming what was basically child pornography, I would just like to say that because of my lack of sex education, I had no idea at the time what pedophilia was.  I have never heard of predators that wanted to hurt kids because they were kids. I had absolutely no idea that these things were for the consumption of pedophiles. I thought the target audience were teenagers like I was at the time who were horny and wanted to have sex. I know it's weird that I thought there was pornography aimed for 12 year olds but thats legit what I thought. 

Really there's no good way to describe it, I was so grossly ignorant. 

So with regards to my ex-friend, I showed him all this content of 12 year olds having sex because I thought it was for 15 year olds like us at the time. Eventually though, I got tired of trying to find material to talk to him about because it was just to much work just to have someone to talk to. 

Fast word to around the time I turned 18 and youtube was suddenly flooded with videos raising awareness about predatory youtubers taking advantage of their young audience. Because every other vlogger was talking about this, I for the first time in my life learned what pedophilia was. I immediately thought of all those loli and shouta mangas I consumed when I was in high school and felt a deep whirlpool of disgust. I was so horrified with myself. 

Suffice to say my reaction was a vitriol purgation of all such content in my life. I don't exactly know if I was consuming any by the time I was 18 because I have heavily repressed those memories, but I stopped that shit as soon as I realized what it actually was. 

I mean that's the proper reaction. Right?

Well fast forward about two years and I learned at 20 that when EF was 18 he was dating an actual 12 year old. Everyone who knew him was like WTF! That was my reaction. I was like ""why would he do that!"" and ""why is he ever like that....oh...""

And I remember that shit I showed him back when we were fifteen.... FUCK

I know EF had never consumed any of that stuff before I showed it to him. Presumably, I'm the one who got him into that stuff. I never really thought it would be a problem because I assumed that like me he would stop being attracted to children/teenagers when he was no longer a child/teenager himself. 

Oh dear god I was wrong. I created a pedophile. 

Some of you might think I fucked up and some of you might think I didn't fuck up and another man's actions can't really be my fault.

And while I absolutely do not blame myself for EF's continued predatory (actually I cut him out of my life as soon as I heard so idk if he still does this shit) behavior, I do blame myself for ever consuming that type of media regardless of the fact that I didn't know any better.

It was a fuck up and I fucked up big time.

201,tifu,"My girlfriend and I were just buying clothes at this place in a shopping centre, and i went to go try on a shirt in the changing rooms. 

The changing room doors DO have locks on them. They're similar to ones you find in public restrooms. They show up green if they're available, and red if they're not. 

So there are like, 8 changing rooms. About 2 were taken (since they show the red dots near the door handles.) And i just so happened to choose one that had a half naked lady in there. SHE WAS TRYING ON A BRA AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOCK THE DOOR.

202,tifu,"So a little background, I am 21. Canada, live on my own. I've had a few dates but nothing has really happened in probably 10 months now. Haven't had sex or even cuddled since my ex. She had cheated on me. Last week i started getting back on dating sites but, not expecting much. Obviously this is a throw away.

Got a date last week but she started talking about how she didnt like working and wanted a rich boyfriend. Friday was supposed to be a different date but she ended up cancelling. So not much luck, but hey I have spare money.

So i thought id turn to an escort service. Now for reference I want everyone to understand that I had this a bit confused. I thought an escort was someone you paid to let take out on a date and see how it goes. Maybe a little naive but I thought thats not illegal right? I'm still not even sure if it is.

Anyway, so i check out this website. Meant for finding escorts in your area. Looked up to see if it was safe, apparently it has a good verification system. Thats what google says atleast. 

So I take a chance. Maybe something can come out of this? Why not. So i get to browsing all these beautiful women. This could work out well! 

I find someone that I find cute and I text them! We talk a bit about the price and what not. 250$, not too bad but definitely the most I can spend. Although i was very nervous and not sure it this would be a scam.

So to make sure she is real, I ask for a picture, promptly she sends. Just as beautiful as her profile! She says shes into smoking a bit of weed to break the ice. So I send her the money, through etransfer. Easy!

Well she probably spent almost an hour telling me she was on the way and leaving. She had to stop by timhortons! So I patiently wait anxious and excited for my meet up! I had already gotten ready.

Just to add, at this point I had showered and cleaned up. Got my room looking nice, put some nice clothes on, brushed teeth, cologne. The whole shabang. 

She finally texts me back, telling me she left timhortons. Along with that text also came ""hey hun i got another man asking for for time, send more money"". 

Well i can't do that. I already sent more than i should have. I just wanted to chill and have some cuddles for a bit, 2 hours is too much. So I'm getting a little discouraged. 

She starts demanding that i give her 250 $ more or else she will post my adress and information on the internet. This scared me, I never do this kind of thing. 

Back and forth we argued, me begging her not to post. Her demanding me to send more money. Freaked out and feeling like a loser I call my friend. 

""Can you please go somewhere alone?""
I tell him this awful story while still arguing with this woman. ""What do I do, I wasnt trying to do anything wrong I'm just lonely"" 

At this point I'm freaking out because shes telling me that its illegal to pay for sex work, but that wasnt my intention. I had mistaken what was going on, but I dont have more money to send.

So I beg her not to. Still talking to my friend while he is calming me down. I get distracted and stop answering her. She keeps sending more texts.

I come back after 15 minutes to find the final text saying ""okay fine I won't post your information""

The principal said he believed me, but he also said it's impossible for him to ignore my poem, even though I assured him it was nothing more than random words that just popped into my head at the time.

I was relaxing in my living room while my parents were out. I had just pulled an all-nighter to finish my paper and I was watching TV and browsing random junk on my phone to relax when I had a small itch on my testicles (This is a warning that this post will be getting a little graphic)  
I went downtown to scrotum town to give the crown jewels a scratch and, in my unfocussed state, I missed slightly and scratched down the back of the tube-like thing that's attached to your balls. (which I later learned is called the epididymis) This made me flinch slightly as the sensation on my jubblies was completely unexpected.  
I didn't think about it though, scratched the itch in the correct place and carried on watching TV.  
  
Within about half an hour though, my lack of sleep started to catch up on me (very suddenly) and I felt myself drifting off to sleep at about 2pm.  
  
I woke up at 2:45 to a numbing, sort of dull ache on my left penny in my coin purse. I thought nothing of it though and hoisted myself upright to drink water and then went back to sleep.  
  
I woke up a little later completely keeled over in the fetal position with my arms between my legs. I don't remember waking up but I was in this incredible pain, like I'd snapped a muscle in my balls. I can't really describe it but my left testicle felt ""different"" almost. Like it had gotten lumpy, bigger and soft. As I tried to right myself, sit up and adjust my pants, the pain struck all the way up my body and I vomited onto the carpet.  
At this point I decided I needed to go to hospital so went on my phone and ordered an Uber there.  
  
In what ended up being the most excruciating pain I've ever felt, I lay on the floor next to my vomit and waited an agonising 10 minutes for the Uber to arrive. Once it had, I bit my tongue and dragged myself (as upright as possible) to the front door and into the back of the Uber. The Uber driver didn't really give a shit as I groaned and clenched in the back of the car and sort of dumped me outside the hospital. The next thing I remember was standing in line for the emergency room before trying to sit down. (I found out later that I had actually collapsed)  
  
I woke up the next morning with one less testicle, a very scared mother and a lesson in something called ""testicular torsion"".

209,tifu,"Happened a couple hours ago. Husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary, had a nice dinner, watched our wedding video and ate our preserved wedding cake. We wanted to watch a movie and after deciding that Marriage Story might not be the best choice for an anniversary weekend, went looking through Amazon Prime. We came across Life Itself. It has good reviews on Amazon, stars Olivia Wilde and Mandy Patinkin, and is from creators or producers or something from This Is Us and Crazy, Stupid, Love. I thought it looked like it might be a bit sad, but still good, husband though it looked really good so we put it on. 


Massive plot spoilers and I’m going to give you what I didn’t get, a trigger warning for death and suicide. The movie is broken into chapters and the first one starts with a guy who is clearly having a bad time. He’s popping Zanax and getting them down with alcohol. We see him with a psychiatrist and are lead to believe his wife has left him. He was committed and is now going through mandated counseling. Great this is going to be sad I think to myself, but let’s see where it goes. We get the back story on their relationship and everything is going well they’re having baby, and then he’s finally talking to the Dr about the day when his wife left him. I’m getting an inkling that something isn’t as it seems. He’s flashing back to the “day she left” and back to the present where the Dr is asking questions and she seems to be leading him somewhere, and then we finally get to the somewhere. His 8 months pregnant wife gets hit by a bus and dies in front of him. He was so distraught by the trauma of seeing this that he convinced himself she left him. The Dr tells him his daughter survived and says she thinks he’s ready to go see her. He says he doesn’t want to do this anymore gets up to leave and shoots himself in the head. I fucking lost my shit. I’m 4 months pregnant. It was not a good time. Husband turned the movie off. I was so emotionally overwhelmed I started laughing hysterically at our poor decision making until I started crying at what I just watched. It was not fun. Tried to put on a happy movie but probably won’t stop thinking about this one for a while. I googled the movie after to find out the end and saw that it had 14% on Rotten Tomatoes. From what I read of the rest of the plot I do not recommend anyone watch it. I definitely won’t be flying blind into movies for at least the next 6 months.


TLDR: (trigger warning death and suicide, and spoiler alerts) I’m 4 months pregnant and it’s our 1 year wedding anniversary, DH and I watched a movie about an 8 months pregnant woman getting hit by a bus and dying in front of her husband who then shoots himself. Do not recommend.",TIFU by not checking movie reviews for Life Itself before watching
210,tifu,"Ok so obviously it all started weeks before today but I basically found myself in an unwanted, never-intended, one sided relationship with a psychopath. Before anyone corrects me with the wrong use of the word psychopath let me explain why I came to this conclusion; at first everything seemed normal and fun. He was nice and thoughtful, respected my boundaries and was cool with the fact that I didn’t want a relationship or anything more than a casual friends with benefits kind of a thing while occasionally hanging out. My first mistake 🚩 1. He was calling and texting me way too much for just a casual flirt. At first I kept ignoring his calls and told him I was busy throughout the day and that he shouldn’t be calling me and texting me 18 times during work. He kept saying sorry but it just became worse and worse to a point he would call me nonstop until I picked up and made up stories about health problems which went away when he was with me... (I know, how creepy?) 🚩 2. He started “clearing” his schedule for me so we could spend more time together and expected me to do the same and started getting defensive and upset when I didn’t have time for him. One night I decided to go out with my friend and he kept texting me while I tried to have fun so I turned off my internet only to find 24 missed calls from him and several messages saying he’s going to the hospital and etc, blaming me for being heartless for not taking care of him. 🚩 3. Even though I told him I didn’t want a relationship almost each time we hooked up he tried to make future plans with me like let’s move in together when I graduate or let’s travel here and etc... 🚩 4. He expected to see me every day and when I said I am busy he wouldn’t be able to say anything but when I said no I’m going out with friends he would become really defensive and annoyed that I would choose my friends over hanging out with him when we haven’t seen each other for ages (only 3 days). 🚩 5. He showed up at the the place I went with friends without an invite just to say hello and to see me.  
I know all these red flags don’t seem too much of a problem to some people but it really is for me and I just became a heartless b**ch and a crazy delusional woman for “the things I’ve done to him” . But feels great to be free now.

tl;dr: wanted to have casual “friendly” sex, ended up in an unwanted relationship with a psychopath who tried to control my life.",TIFU by ignoring red flags in a guy I’ve been seeing.
211,tifu,"so, first of all, sorry for my bad English, not my principal language, yada yada

Ok, so I was at my grandma's birthday party in her house, which it's kinda tiny so we were everyone in a really little space, being like 20 persons there, and as i'm so introvert, I don't know almost anyone there except for my uncle that I will call ""S"", my grandma, my brother, mom and dad.

So, they were taking photos and in some moment they said that her son's will take a photo with she, so there it was my dad, an uncle and there it was missing ""S"" (he was working), but then someone entered the house with a photo of ""S"" and put it close to her.
So, before taking the photo someone said ""say whisky!"" and as I'm a dumb guy with a dumb sense of humor i said  ""the photo can't say whisky"" and everybody was looking at me at that moment with an uncomfortable silence; I was like ""oh god, that was a really bad joke, sorry"" in my mind but then someone laugh and just continued with the photos.

So, actually, I didn't wanted to say that joke to everyone, just to me, but it was a really tiny space so everybody listened.

Like 3 minutes later, my brother started to talk me in English (I'm Mexican, and almost no one understands English in that house) and he told me ""you know who is he, right?""
So I replied ""sure, my uncle S, but the photo is because...""
Then he said ""he's our uncle X; he died 8 years ago; actually her ex-wife it's to your left""

Then i realized what I did

Everyone was watching me and I was thinking that it was bc of that bad joke, but it was because it was even worse than what i thought.

212,tifu," 

I'm  a 31 year old man. I haven't had any skin issues or breakouts since my  early 20s. I'm in nursing school. My first semester was brutal and it seemed like every week I  had a new gigantic zit and I was so embarassed, I'm a bit shy as it is  and it made me super uncomfortable during class and clinicals.

So,  a bit of background info: I have a dedicated study area in my house. My  wife and I rent a small (like...very very very small) home. It's tiny  but its our first place together that isn't an apartment and we love how  quiet and peaceful it is compared to apartments we had in the past. So  because it's so small we have to improvise/make the most out of our  small space. For how small it is we have a walk in closet that is a  decent size. So before school started I said fuck it cleared out a side  of the closet and put a desk in there and made a dedicated study area  that is away from my wife and I can study in peace. During the first  semester if I wasn't at work, clinicals, or school then I would be in  the closet(lol?) I spent hours and hours in there. All the while my skin  was getting worse and worse and I figured it was because of school and  how stressed I was. When the semester was over I stopped going in the  closet because I had no need to, I wasn't studying and I wanted to enjoy  my winter break. My skin cleared up and was back to normal. I thought  it was because I wasn't stressed with school anymore.

Cut  to a week ago when I started going back in the closet to prep for the  next semester. And after a few days I noticed a super gross pimple  appearing on my face. I deducted that my skin breaking out wasn't due to  school but rather all the time I was spending in this closet. Lightbulb  went off in my head and I thought it must be the indoor humidity in the  closet. Got a humidity reader and inside the closet it was at like 72%  humidity! No wonder I was breaking out all the time.

Typing this from the closet as a dehumidifier is running and the reader says the level is now at a normal indoor level.

tl;dr: I'm an idiot.","TIFU by thinking my adult acne was due to stress from being back in school, turns out it wasn't."
213,tifu,"I'm pushing the term 'today' a bit far, as this was 1994, when I was 7. Reddit didn't exist then. 

I'm playing in the forest with a friend, swinging around trees, addicted to ninjas, and talking about how I'm actually a black believe  in karate. Like ""this is how you swing from a tree with a flying kick...""

We encounter some older kids, about 11-13 years old. My friend starts telling them about how I'm a black belt and kick any of their butts. All of a sudden, I'm one on one with some bigger lad who just punches me in the face. The only moves I knew were kick and headlocks. I'd charge at him and try to kick or grab his head, but he'd just keep punching me in the face. I probably landed one good kick. After a while I agreed he was better than me and I should give up.

214,tifu,"I was going on a trip to Japan, but I didn't want to carry my original college ID card with me. There is a huge fine for losing it and getting a new one.So I got copies of it made. 

Today I saw a notice that you could turn yourself in and get the copies replace with new one before 21st January. And it would cost a 1/10 of what we usually have to pay to get a new one.

So, I thought why not submit the copies and get original one. If I was caught with copies after 21st,I  would have to pay 5x the cost of getting the ID replaced and strict action will be taken.

I head to administration to turn myself in and get new ones. But the office staff was surprised that someone actually reported themselves. I am suppose to go and pick up the original ID's after a week.

I am really worried now. I might be the only person who actually reported themselves. My university has a reputation for being very strict on these matters.

Everyone in the house was gone, and I wanted to try it. So I spent about 10 minutes researching how to do it, and when I started to masturbate to get things going like you usually do. Then when I was about to nut, so I got into the position, I laid down on my back, and removed my pants and underwear, and tried to get it into my mouth. It wasn't working so I put my hands on my ass and pushed towards my mouth, suddenly I felt that the tip go in, and I started to nut. Suddenly I was more flexible and my mind was like fuck it, and I was able to shove it all in, I think it was a instinct or something, I'm not very sure. My teeth violently scraped against my dick, and I felt a weird sound in my back. Worst. Orgasm. Ever. Now I have two long red streaks on opposite sides of my dick, and my dick and back hurts. Not to mention that I cant get the horrible taste of cum out of my mouth. I want to go to the ER but my girlfriend will get home soon and I don't want to explain what happened.

I get home, and everything is alright. I’m a bit peppy but nothing too bad. Fast forward 3 hours, it’s already 1 AM and I’m wide awake. I stroll on the internet thinking it would make fall asleep. I panic a bit about my college move in day and then try to close my eyes. Didn’t work.
Fast forward 3 hours now. It’s 4 AM as we speak, and out of the corner of my eye I see a spider crawling on the wall behind my bed and I go into the bathroom and spray the living daylights out of it with the first thing I grabbed- which is window cleaner. The spider died, but I just gassed up the entire room with the worst scent ever and I had to open every window and turn on every fan to get the scent out.

Needless to say I woke up the entire family with a lot of coughing.

217,tifu,"Last Tuesday was the first time I had been to the gym after being lazy over the holiday break. I did a pretty relaxed workout but decided to go hard on abs to make up for not doing anything for a while. At first everything seemed normal but the pain in my abs grew increasingly severe. I just chalked it up to being sore but the pain seemed to be concentrated around my belly button that's when I noticed it was protruding out. After some googling it seemed like there was a good chance I  had an umbilical hernia, or Belly button hernia. I called my doctor's office and they recommended I go to the Emergency Room. The doctor confirmed I had a hernia so they gave me some morphine (which freaked me out more than the hernia) and tried to see if they could pop it back in but they weren't able to. So here I am with an IV in my arm waiting for the doctor to perform a couple of tests and see weather or not I need an emergency surgery. 

TL;DR  I did to many crunches and pushed my guts in to my belly button. Now I might need surgery.

218,tifu,"Just finished cleaning up so it's a good time to post what happened here. first time posting, TL;DR at the bottom, all that good stuff.

Anyways so I had this 1.75\[L\] coke bottle that would just not open. I tried the normal opening, the ""stop, breathe, concentrate your force and go absolutely hard on it"" opening, the ""put a cloth over it but regret it because it makes it actually harder"", and the ""try out with your teeth but they start hurting and you remember you are not a damn animal"" opening.

So anyways that's when I took the knife. I thought maybe the cap was broken or something, so I started cutting the place where it meets the cap holder. I did a 360° pass of the knife and tried again.

No luck. At this point I'm starting to act more on instinct than anything. In retrospective, I can see the rationalization behind my actions, but now that I remember it I can't tell if I consciously had these thoughts or I'm just trying to save face with myself. 

""Maybe If i just saw it I can relieve some of the pressure and it will be easier to open"". 

It was more like ""I need my sugar water goddamn it"".

I actually spent last semester in university with suffering through a class on fluid dynamics yet I was not able to put 2 and 2 together on this one, at this point it's just Chronicle of a Death Foretold.

So I start doing just that, and after 3 or 4 minutes absolutely nothing happens. I mean I'm doing the cutting motion but the bottle is barely getting scratched.

And that's when I think ""Maybe I could funnel the coke out"".  
It was actually ""Ah FUCK this"". 

So I stab it. 

I'm intending to Cesar this fucker up, but in the first gut thrust the thing straight up fucking explodes on me. The kitchen table is completely covered in a layer of coke. There's coke all over the wooden floor, the walls, myself and even the ceiling. This is some Tony Montana shit. Everything will be a sticky mess if I don't act quickly.

But I don't have time to worry about such nosense now. After looking in all directions and checking damages, I'm willing to take this pyrrhic victory:

I look over,

The bottle is empty.

Fuck.

I take my wet shirt off and start cleaning the mess up.

219,tifu,"Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile. Obligatory this happened today. So, just to preface, I’m not a tech-savvy person. My computer updates tend to wait until my boyfriend (works in IT) realizes that I haven’t updated in a year and a half, nabs my computer and updates it for me. He also tends to back up my computer for me when he does this, ‘cause he’s wonderful. 

So today, he notices that, like usual, my computer is desperately overdue for an update. So he grabs my computer, backs everything up for me, and starts the update. Not enough space for the update. He tells me, and I mention how I’m not surprised, because there’s like (in my mind at least) a million and eight things installed on my computer. So he goes to investigate. Now, here’s the thing. A couple years ago, I accidentally killed my computer with malware, and they recovered my files when they were fixing it, but in like.. no particular order, and with very little identifying information on the files. I went through and saved the stuff I desperately needed, then promptly forgot about the rest of it. So, my wonderful, tech savvy boyfriend quickly works out that my space issue is caused by the ~58 GB recovered files folder just hanging out in my computer. And most of it is pictures.

We start going through the pictures together, because hey, it’s been a couple years and I have no clue what’s in there, and I don’t really want to delete everything without looking, just in case. And then we stumble upon the naked pictures. Not mine, not his. My parents. Because back when I first got my computer, I was on a shared ICloud account, and when my computer files got recovered, a whole lot of not-my-pictures must have gotten recovered from that ICloud too. 

And now they’re on our backup drive. (But thankfully no longer on my computer. Silver linings.) My poor, sweet boyfriend is traumatized beyond words, trying to forget that he now knows what my dad’s dick looks like. I don’t know if there’s enough chocolate in the world to coax him out of his hoodie.

220,tifu,"So here’s my story.

A couple days ago my Father says to me.

Dad: There’s two jugs of windshield washer fluid in the front. You can take one.

Sick. I totally needed some windshield washer fluid. Whenever I run out I don’t remember to refill for like a week. So obviously, I forget for another couple days.

Couple days pass. And one morning as I zombie my way out the door I remember to grab a jug. Now you need to know, when I wake up. I’m fucking dead. If I’m absentminded when I’m awake, well, let’s multiply that  tenfold when I’m waking up. As if that will excuse my actions.

So this action is a stray from my morning routine. And in my morning state, I am entirely a creature of habit. But this isn’t a difficult action. So I open my hood, fill the washer fluid tank, and head out.

Later in the day while I’m driving, I try and spray my windshield. And am entirely surprised to find it’s not working. And I’m like fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. Another goddamned problem with my car? FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.

So I tell the rents of the newest automotive issue. And I make the mental note to call my mechanic once I remember to stop procrastinating. My mechanic, being PornStar. But I totally procrastinated. Until one day. This occurred.

Dad: WHERE IS THE OTHER JUG OF MOTOR OIL!?

Yeah. 

Dad: THERE WERE FUCKING TWO IN THE PORCH! WHERE’S THE SECOND ONE.

Now the first time it didn’t hit me. But the second time he said something. Well. The realization came. And my mind must not have wanted to accept it at first. Because it still took a minute or so for me to make the connection.

Me: Oh no.

Dad: Seriously. Do you know what happened?

Me: Oooooh no.

My mother hears me say this at this point. And makes the connection fucking immediately. Her eyes widen and she looks at me in disbelief.

Mom: No. You didn’t……

I look at her with this hopeless look in my eyes. I can barely even fathom the mistake that I have made.

Mom: MARTIN! MARTIN!

My father comes in the kitchen and looks at us. Me standing there looking entirely lost. And my mother looking at him with wide eyes. As if in shock. And we didn’t even have to say anything for HIM to make the connection. I look at him slowly and he’s looking at me with this tiny subtle smirk on his face. And he shakes his head and heads out the door.

Mom: You know you’re the only one who could do this right? You’re never going to live this one down.

And she picks up her phone to call her best friend and tell her the news.

So I poured almost an entire jug of motor oil into the tub for windshield washer fluid. And fucked up the whole system. THIS is why it wouldn’t work when I tried to use it. BECAUSE IT’S FUCKING MOTOR OIL.

And the rents were hardly even surprised. Even though it is the dumbest thing I’ve ever done. It still only mildly surprised them. Because this is how their Son is.

And how did this affect me you ask? Well you might not be asking this. But I fucking was. I was fucking wrecked. How the fuck did I do this? How could I make this mistake? How am I fucking like this? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME!?

Seriously. I hate it. And I fucking cannot fucking figure it fucking out. I’m not a dumb person. I promise you. I KNOW WHAT WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID LOOKS LIKE. I fucking know what motor oil looks like. I’ve had a car for fucking seven years. I have filled those tanks over and over and over again.

Washer fluid is fucking BLUE!

Anyways that morning I must have been so fucking tired that I saw the two bottles of motor oil. And all I remembered was my father saying there’s two bottles. So I just automatically grabbed one. I didn’t look at the label. I didn’t realize the bottle was gray. And even when I was pouring it. I remember stopping to think. Why the fuck is it coming out so fucking slow. Like fucking syrup. But still I didn’t process that it was a clear fluid and not blue.

I just shrugged off the fucking doubt, and kept on pouring

First post here lol 

So I like walks and I also like the rain. I heard thunder and decided it would be a great idea to go for a long walk. And it was fun for the first 15 minutes, until it started to rain pretty hard.

I normally don’t bring an umbrella with me ever, unnecessary weight, but my dad made me bring one, which helped a bit later on. Because in my rush out the door, I had forgotten that I was wearing a very thing white shirt. I also didn’t mention that I’m a female and pretty uncomfortable with showing much skin and wearing a pretty dark bra. 

I normally always wear baggy t-shirts,so a skintight white see-through T-shirt wasn’t very fun. I kind of just held my umbrella up to my chest until I got to somewhere where I could dry off.

So now I’m just sitting under a bridge, I waiting for my shirt to dry off a bit so I can walk back home. 

I still think enjoyed the walk here tho.

So it’s my birthday in a couple of days and I haven’t shaved for probably coming up to a year and figured I’d try tidying it up slightly for a couple of outings this week.

I didn’t have a crazy long beard but it was probably 4-5 inches and I was pleased enough with it.

After searching online for some tips I read one to start at ‘4’ on the shaver and work downwards to find the right length to tidy it up. I set it away on ‘4’ and start at my chin where it’s longest, first stroke upwards and I knew I was fucked. One huge clump of hair drops from my face into the sink as a tear rolls down my cheek. 

Turns out when I read a ‘4’, I’m assuming it meant inches and I had set my shaver to 4mm(it doesn’t say mm on my shaver). Now I look like a fat ugly ass child instead of a fat ugly ass bearded man.

223,tifu,"UThis culminated tonight, but has been going on since my daughter's birth, almost 4 months ago.

I've always had a terrible time getting my baby to sleep. No matter what, she would have to be snuggled and rocked and bounced every nap, every bed time, for ON AVERAGE AN HOUR. Then she'd only sleep for ten, twenty minutes. She'd eat, then we'd play, and start the sleep. Nightmare over again. 

Tonight, she ate, then we went out. She stayed up for two hours, then got super fussy, so I tried to Rock her to sleep for a nap. Well, she wouldn't go to sleep. She was making these pathetic mewling noises and breaking my heart, when I decided to try feeding her. 

She instantly calmed down. Ate her whole bottle of milk, snuggled up to me, and fell right asleep. 

I started thinking about it and realized I hadn't fed her in almost four hours. No wonder she was so upset and wouldn't take a nap! What I'd been taking as ""I need to nap"" cries, were actually ""mama I'm hungry"" cries. 

Then I realized I'd been doing the same thing.

Every day. 

Since she was born. 

So now I'm sitting here crying because I've been starving my baby for months.

I am an idiot who was going too long between feedings for my infant daughter, letting her suffer and be hungry for months.**

224,tifu,"Ok so this happened 15 years ago, but I've just been reminded of it and it's all come flooding back. So I thought I'd share my pain.

I was living in a big house with a bunch of mates, two doors down was a house with a few women around our age in. One of them I found I had mutual friends with and we really hit it off straight away. She was gorgeous, long curly red hair, gorgeous smile, beautiful blue green eyes, great figure and on top of all that, funny, intelligent, interesting and great fun. I had it bad for her.

We became really close and were hanging with each other all the time, but the right moment just never came for it to switch to being more. All our friends, my housemates and hers were apparently all talking about us and it was obvious it was just a case of the right time.

My housemates had pointed out that we had never had a housewarming despite having lived there for months. So we decided we would throw a big party and invite all our friends and our neighbours; including the house two doors down. We chose a saturday evening and invited everyone.

Cut to the day of. We ended up arranging a bbq in the afternoon for everyone that couldn't come for the later party. All is good, except it meant I started drinking at 1pm; My crush and her housemates turn up at around 7.30ish in the evening. Now by this point I was merry. Very merry. I welcomed them in and her housemates spread through the house and she hung back with me. We had a huggy cuddle, which turned to a chatty/dancy/cuddle and me in my merry state got a boner. I'm big down below, so it was unavoidably obvious, she became aware and gave me the sexiest look. Holding this look she rubbed up on it and in the most come to bed way said ""save this til later for me"", kissed me on the cheek and sexily sauntered off into the party throwing me back sexy eyes. Now at this point I'm horny and frustrated, but very very happy that finally I'm gonna get the girl.

Hours pass. I'm going round the house catching up with people and drinking with everyone. Going from being more and more merry to more and more drunk.

I've no idea how late it had gotten, but I was drunk and was convinced at this point my crush had left as I hadn't been  able to find her. My room wasn't in use for the party, because we had needed somewhere to shift stuff to make space. So I; drunk and disheartened, decided I was gonna go lay down. In the hall outside my room I bumped into one of my crushes housemates. We chatted a bit, she said she hadn't seen my crush for a long time. We stood chatting, the music was v loud and she turned it into having a dance for a bit as we talked.

After a while I made my excuses and headed into my room. My door opened and in walked the friend. Now at this point I would have said there was no way anything would have happened, I was very much wishing it was my crush. But she walked over started dancing again and then out of nowhere started kissing me. I can remember thinking wtf, but not being sure what to say. But then she took of her top and to be totally honest, she had the biggest breasts I've ever seen. She was a good looking girl as well and being a drunk, horny and frustrated idiot every bit of reason left me.

The sex was actually really really great. I've no idea how long we'd been going, but we'd practically banged our way around the room. We ended up on my bed with her atop riding away. She was really going for it, eyes closed groaning away, I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. My door opened and in walked my crush who stopped and open mouthed stared at what was going on, looked at me and just kinda bewildered said oh and walks out.

I had no contact from her for days, when I finally saw her she was really pissed off. I tried to talk but she didnt listen and said her housemate had really enjoyed herself, how she had been sharing everything in detail. I could see she was hurt as well as angry and just felt so crap. I tried to explain how drunk I'd been and how much I'd regretted it. But she in no uncertain terms said at some point we can be mates again, but that was all and until then I could fuck off.

I resigned to the fact that I'd lost her. Now, I was in my defence young... so I thought maybe I could make the most of it with the housemate. The sex had been really amazing, so I was thinking it was pointless not pursuing things with her for the sake of it at that point. So I called her a couple of days later, but only to find her pissed off at me. Turned out my crush had gone straight back and explained to her how much I'd said I regretted it etc. Then she told me to fuck off.

TLDR; Really liked a girl for ages, both keen but right moment never came. Finally at a house party it was clear that night was gonna be the night, but I got drunk, mistakenly thought she had left, and then ended up having sex with her housemate; only for my crush to walk in on us in the act.

225,tifu,"Obligatory, this FU happened when I was a lot younger.

Me and my friends used to play cricket in a small park near my house which was covered by a metal fence on all 4 sides. For those of you who don't know, cricket is like baseball and you take a run from your position to the other wicket and back after hitting a shot and the other team has to hit the wicket with the ball. I wasn't very good at it but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. So, anyway on one my shots I started running and when I was coming back, I started looking at the ball on the side and forgot what was ahead. I completely overran and went head straight into the fence and then toppled over it but didn't fall down as my foot got stuck in it. My friends literally laughed for atleast 5 minutes before they had to pull me out of the fence and then never let me live this down as they still reming me of my FU to this moment.

Our professor was returning our tests back and accidentally gave me someone else's, to which I responded with “mom, this isn’t mine.” Class went silent, my face froze, no one laughed which made things even more awkward. Professor came over and gave me my test back, everything went back to normal. I have no idea why that happened, she doesn’t even look like my mom. Now all my friends are going “aww, do you want mommy to pack you lunch?” and it’s killing me. Thank god this is my last class this semester with that professor.

Still less awkward than the time my ex’s dad and I held hands for half a second when my ex asked someone to pass the soy sauce.

227,tifu,"I should've been doing my homework, but cause I was procrastinating, I decided that I wanted to spice up my eyebrows. I did them fully a few months ago, and from that point on I've kinda just let them grow, apart from the casual plucking to keep their form. And lately, they've been getting all messy and its been bugging me like crazy. So I thought it was a good idea to do them now!

Well, I sat down and I plucked them into a decent shape. Then I went ahead and began trimming. Its bad enough that I accidentally left one of them looking like it was balding towards the end, but they looked quite uneven. The other one had a weird chunk of hair just in the middle. I was trying to get rid of it by carefully cutting the ends of the hair by pushing it to the edges. 

I looked in the mirror again and saw that it was improving! I got so excited, that I just went in for the middle and made a cut.....

And at this moment... I realized.... I really messed up. IT LOOKS LIKE I TRIED TO SLIT MY EYEBROW BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO SLIT IT SO I JUST SLIT IT THROUGH THE MIDDLE! AHHHH ITS BAD!!! Its also very noticeable!!! I tried my best to cover it up with my eyebrow pencil, but its still noticible, though not as much. I'm just so disappointed in myself. I felt so happy with myself, and now I screwed up my dang eyebrow and I'm gonna feel self conscious for the next few weeks :(

228,tifu,"Cross posted in relationship advice. Posting what happened on behalf of my husband because it really is a huge fuck up. Copy pasta below:

I am feeling sick over this, and I know that’s an absolute fraction of what he’s feeling. My husband is the kindest, warmest, most considerate person I’ve ever met. He helps me be a better person every day. In our country tomorrow is a holiday so we were out having fun. We just had family (his) in town and were enjoying some quality time.

Here are some background things you should know to understand everything at play. He has a very extroverted in-your-face sense of humor. It’s really hit or miss with people but almost everyone he meets warms to him after they get it. It’s just not everyone cup of tea which I get. 

This is relevant because when we were out today, we met another couple where the guy had EXACTLY this sense of humor. I swear within a minute of hanging with them I thought wow, finally someone he can connect with effortlessly (which has not been easy to find since we moved to this city). I also got along with the girl great, she seemed very laid back and low maintenance and honestly, that makes sense which how we coupled up with the guys we did. 

Here’s where everything went wrong. The family that was in town visiting is his sister and her two sons, an elementary school-aged little boy and his older brother in high school. We had a really long day yesterday and the little one was tuckered. out. Once he fell asleep it was lights out. We have this inside joke where we make our cats “put makeup on”. It is literally as dumb as it sounds, he holds them up from behind and takes their paw and rubs it on their face saying “aww so pretty”. It’s so dumb but so funny idk. Anyway, when his nephew was obviously in a deep sleep he decided to do the “makeup routine” to him and record it. He didn’t pick him up just took his hand and made his hand drag across his face. Like I said, dumb but funny if you know the background.

The issue is, when looking at this video, it does not. look. good. Imagine a sleeping toddler (who doesn’t sleep with a shirt on, btw, though bottoms were covered) and an older mans hand (my husbands) taking his arms and doing the hand/face thing. He took a couple takes of it so on his phone there are probably 4 thumbnails of a shirtless toddler in bed. So.

It got to the point in the night where my husband was showing this other guy a pic on his phone and across the room, I could SEE the other guy see these thumbnails. I then saw my husband fumble through a bad explanation and show one of the clips. Guys, it was bad. They very quickly made an excuse to leave. The bolted fast.

What sucks is we totally get it. Of course they ran out. One thing that’s hard is the potential of that friendship we’ll never know, but what’s 100x worse is how my husband is feeling. He feels disgusting. There are now two people out there who think he is a monster. He’s sick about it. And there was no good way to explain that, at least not to two perfect strangers. I can’t explain it but knowing that other people think this about you (or your husband, in my case) is just nauseating. 

TL;DR in a perfect storm of wrong situations, my husband looks like he abused a child and is almost physically ill over it.",TIFU by being seen as a monster
229,tifu," 

So my wife (36), her sister (40), and me (41) all went out to a party last night. Sister in law's (SIL) hubby couldn't make and he is a real dick. SIL is always mad at him for some reason. SIL and I have always had a love/hate rocky relationship. There were times that I felt she hated my guts. Other times we've been friendly and I have felt we were pretty good friends. She seemed to be jealous when I started dating my wife and would do silly things like call me and hang up. That was 15 years ago. My wife has confessed that she thinks her sis ""liked"" me before we got together.

Wife and SIL are both beautiful women. Lately, SIL will often compliment my clothes and appearance (""you look so nice!""), gently touches me when she laughs, and spends a little longer than most people looking at me when we talk. SIL has recently lost a bit of weight and is a slender and petite brunette with a pretty face and smile. She's been blessed with good genes and looks no older than 29. I am finding myself more and more attracted to her and I know its wrong. Last night after the party, everybody ordered food except me (nothing that I wanted to eat). After eating, she began to get super bossy and scolded me for not eating. She said that she was going to take me into the kitchen to make me something to eat (ha!). I politely declined but she was being so pushy that my wife egged her on and told me to just agree. SIL is rarely nurturing so we all thought that this was her way of being nice.

We went to the kitchen and I could feel some tension in the room. She started to tone it down and tell me how important it was for me to eat... Kinda weird, but okay. She was all dolled up wearing high heeled boots, form fitting jeans, and sweater that showed off her perky breasts. I had butterflies in my stomach and was pretty buzzed and super nervous. As she was waiting for food to cook I said thank you and went in for a hug. We embraced for a couple minutes just hugging. I didn't feel nervous after that and felt a bit relieved. I told her that she was sweet and was being so nice. We hugged each other again for a few more minutes. I was pretty drunk and simply asked if it was okay to keep hugging her, she said ""mm hmm"". I told her that all I wanted was to hug her. It did not feel sexual and neither of us tried to kiss or anything like that. Truth is, I really enjoyed holding her.

Later that night I had to go back to the kitchen to get some water. She asked me if I was okay and I was like ""Sure, of course. I'll be right back"". She then asked if I was sure that I didn't need help. Not sure if she thought I was too drunk or if she wanted more alone time. It felt awkward, I insisted I was fine, and I went by myself.

Woke up today feeling a little weird about what happened. Sorta feel like I betrayed my wife, but also feel silly because it was prolonged hug with someone who I have always had a hard time connecting with. Not sure if I should ever bring it up with the wife or SIL.

TL;DR Got drunk and hugged my SIL for too long. Nothing else happened but am unsure if I should say anything.",TIFU by hugging sister in law too long
230,tifu,"This happened about a month ago.

I live in a country that speaks english, but has other dominant languages. Let us call one of them X. I do not speak the X language but i can get around with a few phrases and get the gist of the dialogue.

Some people do not speak english that good and speak X, so to be polite i explain that i do not speak their language. I would say ""I do not speak X""  in the X language. 

Everytime i did this, i would get a giggle and people would speak back in X with confusion in their face. I presumed it was because i said it in the most cringy way with an accent (almost sounding like an obnoxious tourist). I never paid it much mind. I would just nod back and elegantly nope out of the situation.

One day i was just speaking to a friend who spoke both languages (english and X). So we were chatting, then he used the language X to make a joke. I awkwardly giggled and said, in the X language. ""You know i do not speak X"".

He bawls out laughing. I am confused and ask ""WTF?"". He then explained to me that I did not say ""I do not understand X"" but I was saying ""I do not have X""

I paused for a minute, then realised that everytime i was trying to explain to people that i did not understand the language, I was actually telling them I do not have their language. 

All the times they responded in the X language was them actually explaining that i was saying it wrong, and I was just pretending to understand them. They were explaining why i was an idiot, and i smiled and nodded, making me a bigger idiot.

I am ashamed and now hesitate to speak X all together. I have English anyway.

So this story happened about 5 years ago when I was in 8th grade. In 8th grade I took Italian as a language it was my 3rd year doing it.

So I interviewed my family which was fucking cringe asf it still makes me cringe to this day. So me being a dumbass didn't even test if I can plug my ps vita into a laptop so I can play the video from there.

So the day finally comes to show the class our  interviews and I walk up with my ps vita and plug it in the school computer to project it to the smart board. Guess what it didn't work then it's just me nervously trying to make it work for 5 minutes till my teacher gets frustrated. My teacher tells me to just hold up my ps vita in front of the class. Let me just tell you looking back this has to have been one of my worst middle school days ever. So there I am in front of the class with a fucking ps vita which had terrible speakers so everyone had to be quiet. Worst part is my interview video was like 4 minutes so I stood up there dying inside waiting for the video to finish.

232,tifu,"So, TIFU with frebreeze. This isn't a major fuck up, but it ie embarassing. Also sorry, I'm on mobile. 

For background, I'm a high school student taking a few college courses and Tuesday we have a final. I decided to have a study group at Starbucks, but after no one showed up I went home. 

After I got home, one dude that couldn't make it asks me if be could come over to my house and study overnight. While it seems really unusual, he was panicking and this test is really important (65% of our grade). He had taken a practice test and realized that he was unprepared, so of course I said yes. We were going to do it tomorrow, but I had a doctors appointment in the middle of the day so it was hard to find a good time. 

So I'm cleaning up my room and was worried that it smelled. I knew that people became nose blind, and after my previous cat sprayed a lot I had become pretty blind to awful smells. I already had candles, a plug-in, and an essential oil diffuser (I'm not into that mlm shit, I just like the smell of lemon oil). Well, I was paranoid that wasn't enough and took some Frebreeze Extra Strength Fabric Refresher and squirted it on my bed, beanbag, chair, and carpet. 

Well if you have never smelled it, it is POWERFUL. I didn't realize it at the time, but the stuff is toxic. It is sickly sweet and just too overpowering. But in the moment I didn't really smell it, and was pretty liberal in how I sprayed. 

So like 20 minutes later and I'm chilling in my bed reading and my head starts hurting and the smell gets worse. Like, a lot worse. I feel nauseous and my skin itches. It gets so bad I throw open my windows (while it is 16 degrees out) and have to move to the downstairs. 

See, I had forgotten that a few years ago I had used it on my bed and broke out into an allergic reaction (it was awful. Half my face was covered in hives). But that was only one time, and after that never had a reaction with  frebreeze again. So I filed that memory in ""Shit I Don't Want to Remember."" Well it is happening again. 

Right now I am itching all over and sick to my stomach. I'm stuck downstairs with my parents watching crappy movies. I cancelled with the dude but he doesn't believe me and now I look like an asshole for making such a wild excuse to cancel.

233,tifu,"I'm male. This happened earlier today (about 3 PM)

I was at my grandparents' house for the day and, being the antisocial introvert I am, stayed upstairs and read a random book while the others were downstairs.

I began to feel extremely bored so I looked around to see if there was anything to wank to, all I could find was this old book about reproduction, but I wasn't THAT desperate, so I just went into the bathroom and locked the door. I looked in the medicine cabinet to see if I could use anything there for lube and found an old tub of Vaseline.

I thought ""Fuck it!"" I usually masturbate in the shower and use shower gel but I had heard that Vaseline is a good lubricant so what could go wrong? Either this was a very old tub or I had heard wrong, either way it didn't go as planned.

I scooped some out of the tub and rubbed it onto by shaft, it felt pretty good so I rubbed some more onto my bellend (using a different hand so I didn't contaminate the tub with my dick or whatever.)

I started rubbing and the sensation was enough to get me hard, but something felt off, my cock was extremely sticky and my hand didn't slide across it very easily. I found this strange but thought nothing of it so I picked up the speed, yet still, it was sticky and felt a bit un-lubricated. I decided to try and wash it off as it would be easier to use their shower gel or something (though it would make a mess.)

I went to the sink and turned on the hot tap, running water fell across my knob and the warmth gave me a little tingle, I tried to rub the Vaseline off but it wasn't going. Then the water betrayed me, the gentle warmth turned to a painful heat and I instantly flinched back, I turned off the hot and turned on the cold, cold water's better than no water, right?

Wrong, my proudly stiff penis quickly receded and drooped but I powered on, bearing the numbing cold. Nothing changed though, I still had a sticky shlong, so I turned off the tap then patted my shaft and bellend down with toilet paper. So here I am, sticky dick in hand and wondering what to do, I won't get home until 9 PM so I couldn't just wait it out.

So I tried one more thing, the maker or breaker of my sticky-dick situation, I didn't want to use their towels because it's my dick and I would be rubbing Vaseline onto them, but it had to be done. I reluctantly wrapped a towel around my penis and started to rub it up and down my shaft, SUCCESS! The Vaseline started to come off, so I kept at it and after a couple minutes the stickiness was almost completely eradicated, afterwards I got my trousers back on and went back to my book, I didnt feel like fapping anymore.

234,tifu,"Just for context, I've been working at Subway for 3 months so I shouldn't have made a mistake a bad as this. 

When this happened, I had been working alone for about an hour in the shop and another employee was due in soon so it wasn't so bad and it was in the evening so it wasn't as busy either.

So anyway, I got an uber eats order for what I thought was 2 sandwiches so it was all fine but later on afterwards, I got a phone call from the guy who ordered them and he said he had ordered 3 other sandwiches which I realised I hadn't seen on the order (don't ask, I'm blind). I said to him that I'd get the next uber eats driver to deliver the food and that I would give them their address. 10 minutes later, the other employee comes in and I tell them what's happened and they said that the uber eats driver probably won't deliver something for free, so I looked up the address and it turns out it was a 3 minute drive away from Subway. I made a decision to make the other 3 sandwiches, order an uber and deliver them myself whilst the other employee was still in the shop. I got in the car and I told him about the situation and I asked him if you could drive me back to Subway too and he agreed. I got to the house and the guy (who I assume was the same guy who ordered the sandwiches) answered the door. I apologised, gave him his food and went back to Subway. When it was done, I tipped the driver and he drove me back to Subway. The other coworker and I were laughing about it for the rest of the shift.

So this wasn’t today, maybe a couple of months ago. 

My fiancée and I like plants a lot, when I moved in and we had a whole house to fill we had a great time arranging them and making all the rooms look nice, except for this one cactus that I hated. It had those tiny, super sharp spines that are almost invisible and super agonising. 

So after brushing my sleeve/hand against it one too many times I relegated it to the spare bedroom windowsill. It used to catch on the curtains as we opened/closed them but I didn’t care since it was out of my sight and it was only usually used as a guest room or office. 

I don’t usually wear makeup much but we were headed out to tour a prospective wedding venue with my family so I decided to put some effort in. The natural lighting in our bedroom is crappy in the mornings so I head into the spare room on the other side of the house. This is when I fucked up. 

I put all my brushes, palettes and whatever on the windowsill, move the cactus right into the corner and used the mirror in my eyeshadow palette. The lighting was flawless and I was looking cute. Felt like a ‘real’ bride to be. So I’m nearly finished and I pick up my concealer brush. It’s like a tiny stippling brush so I dab on the makeup and pat pat pat until it’s all distributed nicely. 

I’m pretty much done now and just wipe away a little stray mascara from my lash line when I get this pain like a stye. I brush my finger over the area and it’s agonising, plus now I have multiple sharp, stabbing pains under my eyes. 

When I inspect my finger and see a cactus spine poking out and practically mocking me I realised how I fucked up. Every time I opened the curtains carelessly on the cactus bastard he got me back my spreading his evil little spines. I’d put all my brushes down on a cosy bed of cactus needles and then spread them over my face. 

Two hours and lots of tears later I tweezed all of them out of my face and I still made it to the wedding venue on time. Fiancée offered to put the cactus in the bin but, having a new found respect for my enemy, I let it stay.

236,tifu,"This TIFU actually happened 3 years ago but still haunts me.

So my old school was a small, laid back kinda school. The type of school where the principal was the history teacher and brought a soft serve machine every year for his birthday, and where the maths/physics teacher was a professional drummer, rapper, and theoretical physicist. So that also meant that the students were all big nerds, laid back, and never really had rules to follow.

So one day, the principal was 30 minutes late for class and everyone was messing around in class. 2 bright sparks had decided it was a great idea to hide in the teachers cupboard and jump out to scare him. I was going to film their stupidity and post it online.
I filmed them trying to fit in the small metal cupboard together and “interviewed” my classmates on their opinions on this. (Really this was just an alibi for me to show that I was not involved in the bull crap in the cupboard). I asked this girl what she thought of it whilst filming her and she was speechless. Before She could say anything, my friend called me to see something and when I turned back, she was gone. I assumed she went to find the teacher to start the lesson. 5 minutes pass and the girls friends go out of the room looking distressed.

5 more minutes pass and the teacher walks in looking flustered and a bit annoyed as he was in a meeting that took too long. I sensed that he didn’t want to deal with the shit in the cupboard so I told him what the guys were trying to do. To prevent the teacher from opening the cupboard and getting angry, I opened the cupboard for him and a hand slapped my face and another grabbed my shirt.
The two idiots in the closet were obviously pissed so I pushed then both away from me and told them to calm down, and to realize what they were doing was idiotic and to sit down so we can start the lesson. They threw some insults at me and we started the lesson.

The teacher asked where the girls were and I said,” I think they went looking for you”. My friend called one of the girls and they walked in shortly after.

As the girls walked passed me they threw disgusted looks my way and one called me an asshole. The teacher was just as confused as I was and there was a small silence for a second.

The girl who I had “interviewed” walked in and had clearly looked like she had been crying. I asked,”what happened, are you ok?”, but her friend replied before she could saying,”You know what you did you ass”.

Now I’m super fucking confused and I say,”I’m so sorry, but I don’t know what you think it is that I’ve done.”
It was at that time that I learn that the girls has crippling anxiety and when I stuck the camera in her face, she freaked out and left the room and cried in the bathroom. She then texted her friends to help her. Now I have no idea to this day what she told her friends that made them hate me, but I apologised every time I saw her and ignored me. We didn’t speak for a year.

So in conclusion. Most of the guys hated me for being a buzzkill, the girls hated me for being an insensitive prick, and the girl I offended, who was actually my crush, hated me for an honest mistake. And we wasted a whole history lesson.

Tl/dr : At my old school I kinda caused my crush to have an anxiety attack because I was videoing her and a bunch of idiots being idiots.

238,tifu,"Obligatory didn’t happen today (20 years ago this May, actually). It happened in my second week at my very first real job. I was a lifeguard at a community pool, and it was absolutely my dream job. 

The pool was in a small affluent city, and was directly across the street from an elementary school. Every year, fourth through sixth graders would walk over for an end-of-year pool party. Three days a week for two weeks we would have 150 excited kids pack the pool. It was absolute chaos, and I’m not sure how they got away with it. In fact, I’d heard (though never confirmed) that 10 years prior to my fuck up a girl had drowned during one of the school parties, was pulled out, and was life-flighted to a hospital. She survived, but with severe and chronic brain damage (in retrospect this seems suspect, because I don’t think the school would continue the pool parties after such an event). 

I was 15 years old and had completed my 2-month (?) lifeguard training about a month earlier. I want to emphasize here my age. My puberty monster was still in absolutely control of my body and my brain when it wanted. Add to that I was raised in a really religious home and was taught to suppress my sexuality in absolutely every way. Thus, seeing an attractive woman could very easily become an insurmountable obstacle.

On the day of my fuck-up, we had one of these pool parties. 150 screaming, rowdy kids. In addition to these kids, though, was one very shapely brunette teacher. I’m not sure what possessed this teacher to do this, but she wore a very skimpy bikini. AND I WAS MESMERIZED. I noticed her before I started my rounds in the lifeguard chair.

When I got into the stand, it was all I could do to not look at her. I was in one of the chairs near the 12-foot-deep section of the pool, and because of how crowded the pool was and how young the patrons were, I knew the stakes were high.

But I couldn’t control myself.

She was layer out on a deck chair on her stomach. I’ll spare you the details (and my thoughts), but I couldn’t look away. We rotated chairs every 15 minutes, and I don’t think I looked at the pool once during my rotation. At one point a group of kids ran up to the teacher and said something to her while pointing at me. She just laughed and laid back down, and I just kept looking. 

Suddenly I heard a long shriek pierce the air. Then another. Then another. Holy fuck, three long whistle blasts. That meant we had a floater, an unconscious victim in the pool. My heart jumped to light speed. I could see the lifeguard in the chair on the other side of the deep end springing from his seat and start to descent down the rungs.

Everyone in and around the pool froze. What was previously mayhem became absolute stillness. I scanned my area. At that moment, my racing heart jerked to a halt. Directly beneath my chair was a body floating face-down, lifelessly. 

But something was off. The body wasn’t a child, it was a woman. And she was wearing a swim cap. A red swim cap.

Before I could process the meaning of this, the floating body suddenly stiffened. Her head came out of the water, and out of her mouth came words that slammed into me with a force I’ve never since felt. “Stop, no!” she shouted to the other lifeguard. Then turning to me, “That is REALLY scary. Really scary.”

The silence was enough you could hear a butterfly flap it’s wings. My heart began thudding heavily in my chest. I was absolutely speechless. If this hadn’t been a drill, a person could have died right beneath my gaze. 

Soon the children began bustling again. My boss didn’t pull me out of the chair, and I finished my rotations. When I walked into the guard shack, not a word was said. Nothing needed to be said. Everyone knew I had learned my lesson. 

And I did. A couple years later at the same pool, the focus and scanning techniques I developed as a result of that terrifying and mortifyingly embarrassing event enabled me to save two kids who had wandered to a part of the pool where they couldn’t stand.

239,tifu,"So I saw the story of the guy with his nut problem and thought I would post my experience from when I was a stupid teen. So essentially this story started 10 years ago. 

When I was 16 I was in the bath and my stupid mind thought I could see how far I could twist my nuts. For some reason I thought they would do a 360, obviously not. About 30 minutes after being out the bath I got a horrible pain and I couldn’t stand up. Mum took me to the hospital where multiple doctors felt my nut and told me what had happened, but my nut twisted back on its own. 

Fast forward 6 years and I’m on holiday in Morocco. On the first day it’s a red flag by the beach, so it’s a no go in the sea but me and my ex girlfriend now ignore and still go in. It’s a lot of fun with the big waves. But after getting flung up from one of the big waves I feel that pain from years ago, I knew exactly what it was. I got out and rush back to my room, within 30 minutes it’s all swelled up and I’m crying. But this time I’m now in a foreign country.

We get a emergency doctor to come out just to basically give me a lift to get the hospital, he had one look and went “yeah you need to go hospital.” Cost me the equivalent of 60 pounds just for a cab journey from him. I get there and I get rushed straight into surgery as I’m now on limited time to save my nut. I get a spinal anaesthetic and I’m under. Should also point out no one speaks English and my ex is panicking and left on her own for 2-3 hours in the waiting room not knowing what’s going on. 

Surgery goes perfect, they do a procedure where it won’t happen again and they saved my nut. From the one doctor who could speak some English, he said it was always gonna happen from the first time I twisted them years ago. It’s like a ticking time bomb. So I get left in a corridor for nearly an hour, on a bed under a whiteboard where doctors and nurses just casually put their paperwork on my chest. They finally find me a room which I have to share with another man and his family. My ex is finally now with me at this point, and that’s when I tell her I didn’t get holiday insurance so now we think of the worse. 

I need to go to the bathroom so she helps me up and that’s when I’ve noticed that I’ve been laying in my own shit and blood for hours because of the spinal anaesthetic. I think that was probably her breaking point in life, she’s now wiping my arse and thinking how much is this gonna cost us. The bill only comes to just under 900 pounds which we felt very lucky with as we thought it was gonna be thousands. But we still couldn’t afford it, we have to call her mum for help and I remember her words, “I’m only paying for this as you could give me kids one day”. Oh how she was wrong by saying that. I didn’t stay in over night as I knew that would be more money so we get a cab from the hospital. Moroccan cabs are very cheap, it cost us something like 3 pounds so I could of done that instead of the emergency doctor at the start. 

They didn’t stitch my nut up either as it’s gotta heal, so I have to clean it myself every day and bandage. It’s so gunky and the stench is disgusting. For the next week I just sit by the pool, reading Kevin Bridges autobiography. I’ve ruined the holiday which she had paid for and it was also for my birthday too. Essentially she broke up with me a few weeks after we got back and I think that was the nail in the coffin.

Obligatory this happened two days ago, but the memory is fresh in my head.

My best friend just did her bachelors exam (she got the highest score of her class woo!) and we decided to celebrate by going to this local spa. 
The spa itself was wonderful, with loads of saunas, spa rituals and multiple pools.

So me being in a treat yourself mood, I decided to get a massage. Now I absolutely love getting a head massage from my boyfriend or at the hairdressers when I’m getting my hair washed, so I opted for getting a head and shoulder massage.

In theory this sounded amazing, so I was super psyched. So when I walked into the treatment room and saw a tiny Thai woman, I didn’t think anything of it.

But what followed was essentially 30 minutes of torture. She started by massaging my neck with so much force and strength, that my neck was still red hours after the procedure. She had to tell me multiple times to relax, because I was tensing up from the pain of her fingernails digging into my skin.

Afterwards she got on the massage table and dug her elbows into my back. I honestly thought I was going to scream, but somehow kept my mouth shut.

She pushed my head down and to the side and cracked my neck!! I have never had that done to me, but I was honestly just in shock during the whole thing. She cracked my back as well and luckily the 30 minutes was over. Honestly, the longest 30 minutes of my life.

At home I looked up Thai massage, and was pretty surprised to find out that it’s supposed to be painful. If I would’ve had any idea that this was what the massage would be, I would not have gotten it. Two days later my neck is still bruised and sore.

TL;DR: I purchased a head and shoulder massage and ended up essentially paying for torture.",TIFU by getting a massage

So yesterday I was walking with my girlfriend and her friend and we got onto the topic of blood somehow. My gf's friend said that she hated dealing with blood, unless it was her own

I asked her ""Do you deal with your own blood often?"" Awkward silence...  My girlfriend asks me to leave. I confusedly oblige and go to hang out with some friends. Still confused as to why I got told to leave I was pondering it over but just forgot about it. It was only later that day hanging out with friends that what I had said really clicked in my head:

I had asked her friend if she dealt with her blood often. As in once a month. That time of the month.

242,tifu,"So, today I was just browsing a forum, much as we do here, and I came across a thread talking about another forum that has posts sorted by area code. Sounds interesting, and who knows maybe someone I know said something stupid. I could use a good laugh. I was kinda curious about this so I followed a link. Everything was alright and I found some funny posts in an archive from my old area code. Then, things got unusual. I clicked next, and the post was actually a folder of 3 nudes of a girl that used to be a platonic friend of mine from high school, that I haven't talked to in close to nine years. The post was from 2013, and I haven't seen her since June 2011. To further complicate things, it did not seem like she posted these herself. It seemed more like an ex boyfriend or whomever she sent them to posted them, and people were mentioning her name and hometown. That's probably a good way to get a stalker.
Here's where this gets difficult. I don't know what to say to her, and I definitely don't want her to think I was LOOKING for these because honestly I wasn't. I just followed a link. I feel guilty for seeing her like that especially without her consent and like I should do something to fix this. I just don't know how.
Even if I did contact her, I don't know what to even say to her or how I would bring this up. Even more awkward problem is I am married now, and so is she. What will her husband think if I suddenly said ""oh, hey by the way I know we haven't spoken in forever but I found your nudes online"".
What should I do? Should I just pretend I never saw them, or should I try to contact her? I feel like she has a right to know but damn this is strange. I was just hoping to see something funny, or a video of one of my old friends doing something stupid from way back when. I never dreamed this would happen.

This happened earlier today while I was at work. I'm a waitress, so once you get to work, you basically can't go home.. unless you're dying, someone died, or you're puking and or shitting your brains out. 

Well, we have this one girl, she's been getting sick at work lately...

244,tifu,"So! At work I’m known as someone reliable who will usually take your shift if you need it covered, meaning I’m pulling a lot of doubles and rarely have a day off. Yesterday was supposed to be a day off and I ended up covering someone’s last 4 hours since they needed to leave earlier. Not a big deal, I still got off by 9 PM and was able to still go on my date.

Problem! My coworker text me around 9:30 PM that night asking if I could take her opening shift (we work in a movie theater). She tells me how she has physical therapy and speech therapy tomorrow. I told her about the date and how I probably wouldn’t be able to really sleep that much if I did. She says I am the last person she is asking and she has no one else to take it. I concede and say fine. 

The problem is is that I got home around 5 AM the next morning and promptly pass out, forgetting to set my alarm! I’m supposed to be there at 8:30 AM and wake up promptly at 9:28 AM. 2 minutes before they are supposed to be open. Thankfully a ton of other people work at the time and I’m sure the department I was covering for set up just fine. I looked at the schedule for the day and who was working, found out that there was someone else working the morning who could cover that shift and everything would be fine. 

I was really out of it when I woke up and honestly just didn’t care that much at that point. I text my coworker this and give up on going in for that shift. I’m already pulling a closing shift tonight anyway, so I figure it’s not like I’m giving up for the night. Originally, my coworker just text me “thank you” and my place of work called me asking me if I was coming in or not. However, it went to voice mail since my phone was already set to do not disturb at this point. 

An hour later, I start getting texted out of the blue by my coworker and she tries calling me. I don’t answer. I don’t want to see them, because I’m sure it’s set in by now that I’m not going in. She’s probably upset, but also our place of work requires us to both sign a paper agreeing to the shift change/transfer for it to be official. I mean, I could have just shown up and it would have been fine. But I’m also not responsible for the shift officially since I didn’t sign anything.

Pretty sure I broke her trust though and she won’t be asking me to take her shift again. I feel bad and like I did something awful but.. I think I’m just too tired for it to really set in. I’m probably going to lose points at work for that as well but with the million of shifts I’ve taken and been scheduled, for this to be the one shift I miss out on.. I can live with it. Still means I fucked up, just that I’m too tired to care right now. I need to stop saying yes to every shift offered to me.

TL;DR: Coworker asked me to take her shift for the 8:30 AM opening shift at around 9:30 PM the night before. I agreed after some hesitance, went on date, got home around 5 AM and promptly passed out and woke up an hour late. I decided, fuck it, and texted her someone else was working that could cover it and that I was sorry. Probably broke her trust, I feel bad but also I need to take this to heart that I don’t have to say yes to every shift offered to me.",TIFU by not going in for a opening shift my coworker asked me to take the night previous.

&amp;#x200B;

So this happened about 2 years ago. I [23M] had been talking to this good looking girl, let's call her Sara, for a while and things started to go well, we started seeing eachother and hanging out and it was nice. No physical contact yet, just some ""hello"" &amp; ""goodbye""-hugs, etc.

My big brother was turning 30 so he planned a big party, i asked if i could bring Sara to the party and it was all good. I asked Sara if she wanted to go and she said she would love to. I was ecstatic! I mean I'm a pretty decent looking guy; 6'5, and pretty slender bodytype, but i had problems getting girls. So i saw this as a great opportunity to get physical with Sara.

So the party started at around 6 PM, Sara would arrive around 9 PM because she had work that day. Now i saw that as a good thing because that gave me some time to have a really good time with some blow and weed before her arrival (she was against drugs so i didn't say anything about me being a regular user)

Fast forward to the party. I arrive on time, freshly shaven head with nice clothes and was ready to party.

The party took place at one of my brother's, let's call him Steven, friends. Let's call the friend Alex.

Now Alex's girlfriend didnt want any drug usage taking place at her home, so we all (around 15 people) came up with a plan to have a plate and a card with some blow in one of the bedrooms, well hidden so she wouldnt notice. And from time to time, people would go in there, one by one, and do the deed. Alex's girl was okay with weed as long as it was smoked on the balcony, so that wasnt an issue.

The party went well. I had some beers, smoked a bit of weed and did some lines of amphetamine from time to time.

(I do NOT recommend mixing so many different drugs on one night)

Fast forward to around 8 PM and now we got a little dilemma. My brother came to me and Alex and told us in a discrete voice that Alex's girl wanted to go to bed, in the bedroom where the stash was, so we had to get rid of it, fast. No one seemed to want to take it so me and Alex said; Sure!

My brother looked at us and told us: Leave nothing behind.

So me and Alex walked to the bedroom and told his Girl that we would just have a little man-to-man talk about Sara who i was dating and it was fine, she went to took a shower instead.

So me and Alex went inside and locked the door and brought up the hidden stash and it was **A FREAKING MOUNTAIN OF COKE** on there. Alex did a nervous exhale and said: Well fuck okay, let's go.

We splitted it in half. Now I'm not good with measurements but the lines were as long as a regular pencil and as thick as a AA battery, it had some height to it as well.

Alex pulled out a big freaking milkshake straw and cut it in half and said that he would go first.

He took it in one go and just threw the straw away.

Now it was my turn and i just leaned down, put the straw into my right nostril and just sucked it in like a vaccuum cleaner.

I didn't feel anything so i just said: ""Cool, lets go out"" and opened the door.

Alex's hand went right by my left ear and he SLAMMED the door. I looked at him shocked and asked: What?!

He looked me deep into my eyes and put his index finger on his lips and went: Schhhh.. wait for a while, let's sit down.

And we sat on the end side of a bed and just looked straight at the wall and thats when it hit me.

The bright white walls started darken and swirl around and my head got heavy. My eyes started watering and suddenly it felt like i was hovering above ground, like i wasn't sitting in the bed. I started seeing like dull fireworks going off in the roof. Like if you put a freestock footage of fireworks, turned down the opacity and mapped it onto some white background. Me and Alex slowly turned our head towards each other in perfect synch and we both had the expression of ""Oh fuck.""

Now Alex's girl started knocking and dumb as I am i said: Come in!

She opened the door and both me and Alex had watery eyes and just stared at his girl.

She asked: Have you been crying?

Alex just couldn't say anything so i took over and said:

Oh heeeey! Excuse the mess, if i knew we would have guests i would've cleaned up!

Alex slightly nudged me with his elbow and then nervously started laughing and said:

Don't worry he have just had a bit much to drink, we were just talking.

She said she understands and asked us to leave the room because she was going to go to bed (shes not a drinker so she wasnt a part of the party) We went outside and continued the party. Everyone seemed to have a good time. My brother came up to us and had a facial expression that asked ""did you do it?"" followed by a slight smile.

I just said: Steven, fuck. and then i laughed a bit while looking away.

Steven nodded and said: Nice, go sit down with the others.

Me and alex sat down in the sofa where everyone was at. They were drinking and played games like ""would you rather"" etc with shots and stuff. Me and Alex just sat there, our eyes were WIDE open and we just leaned back and stared at the roof.

The rest is a bit blurry because i think thats when it hit me even more, i dont remember a thing.

I remember that Sara arrived and i had to act as cool as i can. I greeted her outside where she was beautiful and had a bottle of cider in her hand. Greeted me with a hug and a peck on the cheek.

I was flaming hot, shaking and grinded my teeth like crazy.

She said: So nice to see you!

I answered: Hehehe yeeanngghhh..

She didnt think anything of it, just that i maybe was a bit too drunk.

I presented her to all the party guests as well as my brother and it seemed like she was enjoying her time, she talked to everyone and everyone was nice towards her.

We sat down again at the sofa and thats when it all went black again.

Its total darkness after we sat down, i dont remember a thing, nothing. I feels like i lost concioussness or something, but nothing was out of the ordinary according to my brother.

The first thing i remember after the ""blackout"" was that we were at Sara's place, in her bed. Her hand inside my pants and we made out. She started unzipping my pants and whispered naughty things in my ear. I was sooo fucked up i didn't know what to do. She had two chihuahuas, sitting down and just looked at us.

I interrupted her naughty speech things by saying: I don't feel comfortable having sex while others are watching.

She said confusely: There's no one here?

I pointed at the two dogs like i was a snitch in elementary school, pointing at a kid who took my poptarts to the teacher.

""They are dogs."" she said.

""They have feelings too, Jenna.""

""Who is Jen..."" - I quickly put my finger at her mouth and said:

""Schh, or would you want them to join us."" followed by a wink.

Then i passed out and woke up the day after. She told me to leave right as i woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

We never spoke again.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : I was so high while me and my crush was about to do it, i told her i felt uncomfortable having sex while others are watching. It was her two chihuahuas. I later asked if she wanted them to join.

246,tifu,"I hadn't gotten a haircut for a month or so, and yesterday evening I figured I'd schedule an appointment with my barber for this morning at 10 AM. The barbershop I go to is in a rough part of town, so I always go in the mornings when the ""bad guys"" are asleep. One bad guy in particular was not asleep when I went to get my cut this morning. 

I was nearly done with my haircut. ""Gucci"" (my barber) has a couple friends that he's talking to while he's cutting my hair. I think it's important to add that the barbershop I go to caters to customers who speak Spanish, so they in turn, speak Spanish for the most part. Only a couple guys who work there speak English, and Gucci happens to be one of those guys. 

Anyway, the only other barber in the room says something in Spanish that sets Gucci off. Gucci stops cutting my hair immediately and puts his razor down on the counter to his right. They go back and forth for a minute or two, clearly arguing. I sit there uncomfortably, not knowing what the hell they're saying. But, I wasn't really worried. These guys always argued. In fact, every time I went there to get a cut, at least one argument would ensue between the barbers, so at this point, violent arguments were a normality. Usually, in these situations, I look at the Spanish customers or friends surrounding the argument and I study their faces. Do they seem worried or are they just nonchalantly scrolling through social media on their phone? Most times, it's the latter. 

This time, it was not the latter, friends. Everyone (Gucci's two goons; luckily, no other customers were there but me) was worried. 

The barber who initiated the argument charges at Gucci. Gucci's two goons get up immediately and keep them separated. I'm still frozen in my chair with my haircut only halfway done. The barber begins to push Gucci but Gucci isn't bothered. I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I assumed he was challenging the guy and didn't think he'd actually do anything. Because of his unwavering confidence, I didn't let myself get anxious about the situation. These guys would be separated, one of them would eventually leave, and they'd forget about it the next day. No big deal. 

Actually no, the crazed barber grabbed a wooden baseball bat that just happened to be leaning up against the wall next to his stand. Now I'm freaking, but I'm still frozen. There was no winning for me if I decided to get up and intervene. I didn't know either of these guys well enough to conclude who was in the right or wrong. I stayed seated and hoped for the best.

After a couple missed swings thanks to Gucci's goons, they eventually lost control of this maniac and he got a clean hit. 

POP. 

Next thing I know, my barber Gucci is on his knees, holding onto his left side. The POP was so loud, I assumed one or two of his ribs were broken. Now I'm actually reacting. I unfreeze myself and lean down and lay my hands on my barber's shoulder. 

""Are you good, man? Are you good?"" 

He didn't answer. 

The crazed barber with the bat walked by both of us, and seeing that I was now ""intervening"" and rushing to my barber's aid, he didn't take another swing. He just continued to talk shit in Spanish and walked back to his stand.

You thought it was over? HA. Me too. 

This bat-holding, crazed maniac barber rips open some drawers and pulls out a pair of scissors. Gucci, still on the ground, looks up and sees this. 

The guy looks at Gucci, who is at my feet in agonizing pain, and yells, ""I'm gonna fucking kill you!"" Over and over again. He says this in Spanish, so again, me no understand. I had no idea he said this until Gucci told the cops about 15 minutes after the ordeal. 

Gucci, with the most self-control I've seen from a man, calmly gets up and walks over to his phone, slowly dialing 911. 

Silence. 

The crazed barber man doesn't ""finish the job"" as they say, and instead, he grabs his coat, the bat, and takes the scissors with him as he runs out to his car and speeds off. Gucci's goons and I watch him leave in disbelief. 

""Yeah, hello? I'm at \_\_\_\_ Barbershop and my coworker just hit me with a bat."" 

Well said Gucci, well said. 

The cops got to the barbershop pretty quickly, questioned everyone who saw the event including me, and then they left with the video footage and all of our phone numbers. 

Gucci, with a couple broken ribs and a bloody elbow, finished my haircut. 

Safe to say, I tipped him very well this morning.

248,tifu,"(Throwaway account bc i don’t need my friends seeing this) Disclaimer: this happened December of 2019, but I still haven’t mentally recovered yee yee

A little bit of background: this is my first year homeschooling, and i switched from private to homeschooling because the people I used to hang out with were mean to others and ...taught me a lot. “Cultured” me so to speak. (It was also awful for my mental health but that’s not really related to this)

So I (F) decided to join my cover school’s robotics club, right? I didn’t think I would like it a whole lot, but I wanted to make friends at my new school. So, I got to know some of the girls and guys, and I had a special bond with this one guy, whomst I shall call Kyle. We DMed a lot and were good friends and I, the fool I am, caught feelings. 3 months of robotics practices roll around and final 2 day long competition rolls around. He and I hung out pretty much the whole weekend, talking and walking around together, and ngl I thought he felt the same way. I run the team’s social media and he’s one of the robot drivers so we both had excuses to be walking around and not in the stands the whole time. 

Long story short, we lose the comp and me and a few others run down to the pit to console the drivers who just lost (Kyle was the last driver to go, and he shouldered a lot of the blame— we made it pretty far tho, to the semifinals)  So we head down to the pit and hug our drivers and spotters who just lost, and Kyle is all mopey cause he couldn’t get a score high enough to get us to finals. So me and this other kid sit there with him and we just talk. We missed the rest of the comp but I wouldn’t trade it. 

When the  weekend is over, Kyle and I keep texting growing our friendship. We’d stay up late and text nonstop and text during school breaks and whatnot.. 

The texts consisted of memes, actual conversation, light gossip, rants, story telling, talking about school , etc. I told him about sparknotes and different educational tools, although I didn’t give the “don’t cheat” disclaimer so I sounded awful....  There were no cuss words worse then lmao, ass, or damn, until I sent a couple of uncensored memes [they said the f word and s**t, but they fit the context ~~~ he sent some  risqué memes but they were censored] (I should add that nO noOdEs were sent if you’re wondering)

Now I should add, that we go to a religious school, and his parents are very strict so they thought they raised him to be very sheltered, that didn’t work out too well for them, but I wouldn’t say I introduced any sort of “corruption” to his life. (mine are a little strict too, but not nearly as much) 

About 2 weeks after competition, during exam week, his mom messaged my mom about Kyle and my text conversations. Lots of “oh hecK”s happening at this point. She was horrified because she thought he was perfect up until this point (as far as I’ve been told) I got my phone taken away, and my mom went through it and pointed out every damn reason why some of what we talked about got us in trouble. Basically his mom she said we shouldn’t text or be friends. This was heartbreaking to me, but I understood why she’d say that.. 

The next days were mental hell. I had exams to worry about and study for, but my heart hurt so much and i don’t think I’ve cried that much in forever. I’ve never gotten really close to anyone, and when that happened for the first time, i was on cloud nine. But to have that ripped away hurts so much still ig. A few days after the initial rip, Kyle reaches out and apologizes to me and my mom, and I do the same. He continued to text me, but I said something about how his mom said we shouldn’t text and I didn’t wanna cause any trouble, but if they saiid it’s ok then great. He said he didn’t know about that and he’d ask. He didn’t text me again after, so his parents were probably like ahem hell no

So yeah it’s been a long while but a day hasn’t passed where I think about all my mistakes and what I could do differently and it’s torture ngl.  I miss him but there’s nothing I can do about it. But I feel like even if we could talk again, it wouldn’t be the same, which hurts just as much. F in the chat ig

There was this video post on Instagram which was about a pillow being used as an effective suppressor on a handgun. Now I'm fairly well informed that anything other than a proper suppressor won't work as a proper suppressor on a gun, but me being the dumbfuck I am, decided to go with it. That was the first mistake. The second was that I didn't notice that the video was posted on a meme account. I up my phone's _speaker_ volume to hear what it'd sound like, and that was the third and biggest mistake. Guy in the video shoots the glock unsuppressed, then stuffs the muzzle in a pillow and shoots again, but instead of hearing a silent ""psshhh"" or anything even remotely related to a gunshot, the phone speaker ruptures into the classic earrape version of girls moaning in porn.mp3, and the sound blasts through my entire house (my phone is one loud motherfu). I put my phone on system-wide silent as quickly as I could but I was too shellshocked to react fast enough. Mom and dad probably heard it, but didn't say anything.

250,tifu,"Okay so I'm 18, I know it's still young. But in most cases the chances of getting top place are slim.

I'm basically a huge anime fan and everytime I watch sport anime I regret not entering one especially that I'm athletic. Ish.

I always wanted to join a club but my parents never let me, saying it's too expensive etc.
And now that I'm 18 actually jobless (have enough to survive for 4 months no that bad) and now I'm getting fat. And I moved from huge city to shithole. So basically I'm going downhill.

There's no clubs in this city, I don't want to join one until I get a job, because money.

But yeah I just realised all my dreams are slipping away and from a person who wanted to earn 50k a year and be officer in the army changed to a guy who'd be happy working 8minimum Hours getting 17k.

It's partly my fault because I make excuses but also because it just dosent work, applications I made get rejected, and I just wish I could redo my life and do something I loved. Like a sport, ice skating for instance at least attempt to get somewhere. But now it's all slipping away not enough money, and when there's money there no time.

I sometimes wonder if in alternated universe I managed to get into a club with a good coach and join a team, where I became an athlete.

So it's just funny how my high expectations changed, and it's stupid that my I couldn't even give it a shot at a sport where I could be head to head with most people.

Edit:
I used to play basketball for a bit. I would play alone etc practice shots, after around 3-4 months id be able to get most of my shots in without missing. I also had decent game sense and could go past my friends on 1v1, think it's because I could read them well and surprise them, but never got anywhere as I didn't know how to dribble between legs etc. Couldn't get into a club as well as mentioned before.

251,tifu," This happened a little while ago in my metal work class.

Backstory: I had recently sprained my right wrist, so consequently I had it wrapped in a bandage to stop it from moving. The blow torch that they had where ones that only had gas flowing through them and you had to use a flint and steel to create a spark and light it.

Story: My two of my friends and I where standing next to each other helping one of them light the torch and we couldn't get a spark from the flint and steel. After about three minutes of struggling I decided to stop struggling with my left hand to get a spark from it and used my right. I was holding the flint and sterl right at the top in front of the torch, and finally got a spark out of it. The gas lit and so did my bandage. My friends started to freak out where as I was just in 'put out the fire out mode', and just quickly flicked my wrist in the air to put out the fire. I was then reminded that my wrist was sprained, and I just flung it about and it bloody hurt. This all happened with the teacher helping someone else and he didn't notice a thing.

In the end My bandage had some scorch marks on it, The teacher never found out about it, and I learnt that i am much calmer in the face of danger than my two friends. (Well when I am in danger)

252,tifu,"So, 18. The stupid age. The first year of being an adult. The first year of really having to take responsibility for your own stupid ass decisions. I got hit with that reality hard as hell tonight.

So I got really horny earlier today, and because of that I wanted to see if maybe I could score some on a dating site (already a horrible idea,) and in doing so, I found passion.com, a website where you can find other people to have sex with in your area. It was such a scam, and looking at it now I can tell how dumb of an idea it would be to even go on that site at all now, but I digress. 

So I decided to make an account, and being 18, I was able to confidently put my birthday, my email and my real name, none of which were every private thankfully (at least I did something right). Eventually, I found a girl who messaged me whose name was Allison, or if that even is her real name, and we talked for a little while before moving it over to a different app to trade pics. 

For a few years, I’ve known how horrible of an idea dating sites like that are in the first place, and if you ever get in a situation where you send nudes to a random person you don’t know, it’ll be an extremely bad decision in the end. However, my drive completely forgot about all that stuff and only worried about getting some pics. Then, she mentioned how she was close to where I lived, and she wondered if she could come over and have sex with me. I rejected that, but before that we sent pictures, or specifically I sent pictures first. 

I sent a dick pic, but that wasn’t enough, so she asked for me to send a full mirror picture before she sends anything (also another HUGE red flag,) but once again my drive was so bad I just did it anyway. Then she sent some pictures of herself, and then she tried to instigate a convo about meeting up with me. 

I completely avoided this, and I even gave her the wrong address to my house. Admittedly the address I gave her was my neighbor from across the street so if for example an old man were to get out of the car instead of a blonde lady, then I would’ve immediately called the police on him and got him arrested. 

Too fantasy. Didn’t happen. 

After I sent those pictures, they then said, “Can I ask you a question?” Then they asked, “How would you feel about giving over 200$ before I send these pics to everyone you know? I fucking panicked. I obviously told them how hurt I was by them lying to me, but I knew that they were going to anyway, and besides I don’t think they cared anyway. Freaking out, I immediately ran to Reddit to see if anyone else had advice for situations like this. First thing I saw was file a police report. 

I then ran to get my phone, and I am mediately dialed 911. I hung up after dialing it though because I was scared that I should’ve just handled it by myself, but before I knew it they called me back. I had no choice but to answer them. Long story short, a cop came to my house that night and told me that there wasn’t much he could do about it, but rather I should delete that account, change my passwords, block that person off completely, and go on with the rest of my life as well as I can. 

I knew that I was going to be told all of that, but I still wanted someone of an authority to tell me that anyway to put me at ease. He also told me about the fact that I am an 18-year-old adult now, and that means that I am more than responsible for taking blame for my own stupid decisions, which I completely understand. All in all, I’m not sure if my nudes got out or not, but if they did, they got sent to a different high school than the one I go to, because I told that person the wrong school on purpose. 

Sorry HHS...

TL;DR - Signed up for dating sight, traded with “girl,” almost blackmailed for my nudes for 200$, called a cop, he gave me life lessons, and I felt like an idiot.

253,tifu,"This happened about two and a half years ago.

I often visit a beach resort with my wife's family. It's a seven hour drive, so we leave in the middle of the night, expecting to arrive sometime around mid morning on our check in day.

The drive was pretty uneventful - clear weather, only a little bit of traffic, generally a good experience. We left about a half hour after my brother-in-law and his wife and son, who live a touch further away from the destination, and who take the same route for 90% of the time.

Now, there are two notable things to keep in mind. One is that I have a bit of a lead foot. I don't go crazy, but 10-15 mph over the limit is where I like to be. I am decent at spotting cops along the road, and I'd only ever gotten one speeding ticket in thirteen years of driving, to that point. The other thing is that my wife was in her first trimester of our first pregnancy. She wasn't too sick, but she was in this constant state of meh. She joked that she'd puke out the window if we got stopped by a cop along the way.

We're about 45 minutes from our destination when we approached a car that looked strikingly like theirs. Sure enough, it was theirs! We waved, and I thought it would be *so funny* to text them, ""later, losers!"" We did, and we got a nice chuckle.

It wasn't even five minutes later that we're still cruising along at about 12 over, when we see a cop on the other side of the road slam on his brakes, turn around, and flip on his lights. I assumed he was responding to a call or something, but nope. He was coming for me.

Pulls us over and gives us a ticket for going 12 mph over the limit. Of course, we get a text from my brother-in-law. It's a picture of us, pulled over, accompanied by, ""later, losers!"" Cop was very nice, but we got the full amount of fine - $24 for the actual speeding and $208 of surcharges and fees. Woof.

Today I fucked up bad. 

A little backstory: A few weeks ago I was invited to my friends birthday party. Today was the day of the party. We came at around 6 PM. We messed around had food and watched a movie. We decided to stay up all night. We did a one shot DnD session, and when we got bored of that we played extreme hide and seek. ""Extreme"" meaning we had to hide insane places. On the railing, on a shelf in the basement, in the car. We only had one minute to hide meaning we were all rushing to our hiding spot. Fx decided to bring a butterfly knife, and after some time of playing hide and seek (around 5 AM Sunday morning 19th, and we had all been up since aroud 6 AM on Saturday 18th) I thought he should give us all lessons. Fx agreed and Fx, Fy, 9 digits, and me play with a butterfly knife. I was getting cocky and tried to throw the knife. It flung around and cut 9 digits finger hard.

Before heading the laundry I decided to take along my iPad and pencil to do some photo editing. The pencil is in a utility pocket of the jacket. Not thinking I took out my keys and earbuds, forgetting that the pencil is still in the pocket. Zipped all pocket per washing instructions on the jacket and tossed it in. I started the washing machine and away I went to retrieve my iPad from the car. Once I had the iPad in hand I reached for the pencil only to remember that it was in the pocket I never checked. Thankfully the outer jacket shell is water-resistant and the pencil is only mildly damp. We will see where this goes but hopefully is saved. It seems to be working fine at the moment. Funny thing is I got close the machine with the iPad to verify that the pencil was in the pocket still and the Bluetooth picked up on it.

I was having a really lovely day, I finished work early, went to see my boyfriend and we watched Wallace and Gromit and then went out to see Jojo Rabbit and have a nice meal.
The fuck up begins at the end of the night in the car park.
So my boyfriend and I are on the top floor of the car park and are walking towards the car when he goes “I challenge you to a race” and before he could finish his sentence I started to run. He then runs after me and overtakes me, I’m very competitive and try to speed up. However, as soon as I start to move faster I realise my fate as my knee pops and I feel it come out of the socket. I fall straight to the floor and face plant the concrete and as I hit the floor with such force, my knee pops back into place.
At this point my boyfriend turns around to see me laying on the floor with my glasses tangled in my hair and bag 5 feet behind me. He is in fits of laughter and walks towards me, laughing his head off because I’m on the floor, but he doesn’t realise I’m in excruciating pain and laughing/crying because I can’t move my leg.

So before this happened, let’s go back about 7-8 years, I was a bedwetter, straight up, every night consistently, I wore a pull- up till I was 7-8, I was about 12 when the F up happened, so I still had accidents about every 6 or so months. So we were on a cruise to Alaska. I was staying with my grandparents for lack of room in my parents room ( I have 2 little brothers so they stayed with them). So I go to bed and then I wake up to see my bed sheets wet. Now I was in 7th grade and had just recently “learned” what wet dreams were through brain pop I believe. So I wake up, and being a previous bed wetter I know what urine smells like, so I wipe my hand on it ( I know gross but that’s what I did), and it didn’t smell like urine, ( I think now it was just really watered down urine because I didn’t smell any urine smell). So I wake up and watch some YouTube on my phone and then my grandma wakes up and we just lay down relaxing till we wake up to go on that days excursion. So I get up and she sees the wet spot and starts telling me off and I tell her I doesn’t smell like pee, and at the time I didn’t realize exactly what a wet dream was. So I’m over here telling her, feeling all smart, that I think it’s a wet dream. And now every time I think about that i cringe SO HARD!!!!!!!!

This all starts with an engineering student on a quest to get fucked. So here i was and being super cheep about three weeks ago i head out to the grocery store and get a two bigass jugs of apple juce, a carton of sugar and a pack of bakers yeast. Also not today but it was on friday night the drinking occurred.
       So naturally after a friday of doing nothing i decide its party time and we all hop on the train and head out. naturally not wanting to be the sober engineer i grab 4 fucking leters of this wine that i decided after the fact probably not only alcohol but all types of other nasties in it. Anyways the party gets kicked off shortly after i arrive and i just start chugging wine. Now i dont know about you folks but i have never gotten blackout drunk that fast. there was a game of fuck the dealer going on when i arrived and naturally the guy sitting with the nasty prison wine gets fucked. Now heres the other fuckup So like an idiot after finishing a 750ml bottle of something between 13 and 15% abv catpiss wine i go grab the big jug about 1.5 leters and quickly finish her off. The big problem with that was i was sitting here and i did not do a good job of re-bottling this shit. There was a about a half inch cake of yeast at the bottom of the big jug of wine. So here i sit and i drink the whole thing. Well mostly i tryed to let everyone have some of my homebrew because Im a nice guy like that. Anyways back on track. After fuck the dealer i guzzle this jug of wine. Done in less than an hour not that i can remember anything past fuck the dealer so for thise who are keeping track blackout i half an hour and still drinking. So heres the part where i go from my memories to what I've heard. So the coordenator of the party finds me and my friends who i came with sits me in the kitchen. at this point ive already caused a scene and dont want the attention but i deal with it and between my friends and the folks running things i manage to get back to residence on campus. Also there was apparentally a shooting near the train station that we went near and i had to piss so i pissed off the train platform.
        So anyways i puke on the train and head back to my room the whole way back screaming bloody murdur in french about how my friends are great and how i can ""walk in a straight line in french"". So i get back to my room and my roommate is cool with the whole deal. So i puke in the bathroom and in the middle of our floor and head back into the bathroom lock the stall door and sit there for 20 minutes. So my roommate being a goddamnd saint steps in. Sees my leg sticking out from under the stall and bolts down the hall to get the residence manager. They call up the campus parimedics and the special constables. So this is the part where i come to and i am surrounded by people two special constables two campus first responders and my floor manager and the building manager for residence. They do a whole assessment say yep hes drunk let the dude sleep and leave me alone for the night. So there i lay and pass out. Next morning i wake up still drunk and go to the 24 hour lan party the engineers have planned i stay up all night. So here i sit right now in my room at 12:30 am on a monday ready to puke from thinking about eating the yeast at the bottom of the jug and wondering of i should be trying to puke it up even more than on friday. 

Was a dirty time was sick for a week. Dont sketchy homebrew kids.

260,tifu,"Obligatory this happened my junior year of high school, on mobile, yadda yadda yadda


Background:
    Hey, y'all! So, if the title threw you guys off a bit let me give some context. This was my junior year of high school and the part of Indiana I lived in had a district school from the surrounding 20 miles, kids from all walks of life. This meant rich/poor kids mixed all the time, along with the acceptance and stigma that came with them all.

     Now, most of the time I was pretty much oblivious to other people in the classroom and kept to myself. That is, until my pre-calc class where I sat 3 seats back on the furthest wall. We had a new student walk in who  just transferred from an alternative school. She was nice to everyone and was extremely attentive in class, however she STUNK. I'm not trying to be mean, but think about used diapers left roasting in a hot dumpster in a Texas summer, and that would've smelled better. My stomach jumps just thinking of it.

     Where I really messed up, however, was how I approached this problem. Instead of going to my teacher and asking her to transfer my seat to across the room, I decided to pass her a note. The note read something along the lines of, ""Girl, you really stink. Please take this bar of soap and go to our gym locker room to shower off. Signed, OP and the rest of Mrs. L's class,"" I had a new bar of Dial soap enclosed within the note. I decided to drop it on her desk while she was in the restroom. She came back about 10 minutes later when she saw the car note on her desk and opens it...


     She screamed/sobbed and ran out of the room crying. The paper flew out of her hand and landed right in front of the teacher's podium. Mrs. L scooped it up, read it out loud to the class. Mrs. L then sent me to our disciplinary Dean's office, where I waited for what seemed like an eternity. The dean finally explained that I was suspended for 5 days, and my mom was on her way to come get me. I at least tried to inquire why I was going home, but they told me to drop it. I later got a call from my friend Sam who explained what happened after I left. The girl actually turned out to be living in a group home for underprivileged girls. The house was extremely old and the pipes froze between late October to early March every year. The girl started to see showers/baths as a non-necessity so she simply didn't take them. She also didn't have money for a laundromat so her clothing stunk too. At this point I felt all the color drained from my face. I definitely understood the full consequences of my.actions.


     Aftermath:

     After I returned the girl was nowhere to be seen. I asked a couple of my classmates and they said she was transferred to another class on the far opposite side of the building. I really felt bad, and we bumped into each other during lunch. I bought her lunch and we sat down to talk. I told her how sorry I was using every apologetic word I could think of, which she accepted. We still remain friends to this day.

My family has one computer in the house and it is in the middle of the living room when you walk into my house. It is a 2010 Mac Desktop and it’s where we keep everything. Now onto the story.

It was around 5pm and I had just gotten out of the shower. I got dressed and heard my parents calling for me in that “your in trouble” kind of tone. I walk over to the computer where my parents are. I look onto the screen and see my entire hentai collection along with every photo I have on my phone. I was in shock as the worst thing they could find was right in front of them. I guess my phone was making backups onto the family computer without me knowing. Every thing I ever saved onto my phone was on there. All of the hentai, memes, photos. Everything. My heart was pounding on my chest. My dad asked me if this was mine. I said yes because they could just look on my phone and see all of it. He asked me why I had it on my phone. I couldn’t give him a straight answer I was too shocked to think straight. He scrolled down for a solid 30 seconds before he told me to delete all of it. I deleted everything and made sure to turn off iCloud photos. I didn’t really get in trouble but my parents were very disappointed.

263,tifu,"Kinda long post but please bear with me.
It happened this Saturday.
So I'm studying engineering and the project for one of the subjects is to design an autonomous bot. The theme is told beforehand, and we have around 3-4 months to work on this project.
Except we didn't.
The earlier degrees had this as the project for 3 of their subjects, we had for only one. In total we had 9 projects this semester (11 if you consider those given in parts) and moreover this time there were 2 bots. We somehow assumed that we would have to submit only one of the bots considering the workload (and following the earlier degrees) but almost 3 weeks before the submission, we were told to submit both bots. The other was supposed to be controlled by using a wire so it wasn't that hard but it was time consuming considering we had to first design it, get the parts and stuff. We somehow managed to complete it.
Now this is where the TIFU begins.
For the main bot, we were planning on using an Arduino Mega. Everything apart from the sensors and the microcontroller had to be manually made. Everything is going well, the base and h bridges have been designed. The team leader saw an Arduino Pro Mega online and thought it would be an excellent option considering its using an ATMEGA2560 like the regular Mega but has a smaller size. We all agreed and ordered two of them online.
Everything is assembled, the base is looking good, everything has been tested. Except its not. The two wheels were tested separately and they both worked. They weren't tested simultaneously except for max value of the pwm. I now take the bot to arena to program it.
I upload the code, one wheels starts jerking while the other isn't working at all. We consider the h bridge being broken, which is very common for self made bridges. Change the transistors, change the gates. Nothing works. The fun part is, both wheels worked when the max value of pwm was applied. So basically nothing was working and tomorrow morning was the submission deadline. We spent hours trying to debug and at the end, arrived at this conclusion.
""THIS DAMN MICROCONTROLLER CAN'T GENERATE PWM PN MORE THAN 1 PIN EVEN THOUGH ITS USING ATMEGA2560! WHAT THE HELL???""
We somehow managed to secure an Arduino Mega and were able to verify this fact. After replacing the Pro Mega with the regular mega completely, we once again tried to program the bot. But the Mega we got, well most of its pins were unusable. So at the end we took both our bots and placed them at the starting line.
The marking criteria here all depended on the main bot working. If your main bot didn't work and the wire-controlled one did, you'll get a straight zero. Which we did. I'm just glad that it's over.

TL;DR, the microcontroller used in the project could only generate pwm for one pin and that caused the entire project to fail, earning us a zero for 3-4 months worth of effort.",TIFU by using a bad microcontroller

Well, a few years back, I was speaking to a friend and she stopped mid sentence to point out that she had never noticed I have a “little mustache”. She was so taken back she forgot what she was saying, completely. That same day, someone at work told me something along the lines of  they “respected me/I’m brave” for growing out my mustache.

The next day I had an appointment to get my hair cut, and...you guessed it; the stylist asked if I wanted to get my upper lip done. I was already convincing myself to get it, I guess I was just feeling kind of embarrassed because of recent encounters? Anyway, I have gotten waxed elsewhere, but she seemed really into some “hair remover” she had done on herself, it was less expensive and blah blah, and I was like.. ok fine, whatever let’s yeehaw this ‘stache out of this town. She put some cream on me, waited a couple minutes and when she wiped it off, my lip was hairless, and pretty red (as usual) so I didn’t think much of it at the time. 

So I got home and after a few hours I went to the bathroom...and my word, I had a comically large and dark mustache stain on my upper lip. I try washing my face, but the mustache is still there! I am a perfect mix of crying and laughing at this point, as I call the salon. The receptionist was very polite, apologizing and explaining to me that the cream *may* have some darkening effects, but it is a very rare side effect for the hair removal. Turns out, I damaged the skin on my upper lip, and now instead of a few simple hairs, I had a full blown Yosemite Sam mustache stain on my upper lip. I have had to use skin lightening lotions, vitamin C treatment masks/serums, exfoliating treatments and basically every home remedy you can think of to restore my natural color and I still have a noticeable stain. (It has been about 3 years). 


TL;DR:
I got pressured into using hair removal cream and it left a fairly large and dark mustache stain where the 8 hairs were removed.",TIFU by giving myself a mustache stain on my upper lip.

I'm not sure what I was thinking, but today my morning wake &amp; bake drifted into the afternoon, because I was enjoying being off school, until I suddenly noticed the time and hustled out the door for my eye doctor appointment. 

I had been hitting my vape pen all morning and there was no hiding how stoned I was, but I didn't reflect on this until I was in the waiting area of the optometrist office and the doctor was walking toward me. The first thing she said after greeting me was, ""Woah. Are you okay?"" She told me that I was pale and my eyes looked red. I explained that I had been sick for the past week (true) and hadn't been getting much sleep because I had exams (false). She looked concerned and warned me to get more rest. 

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. I was terrified that it would be obvious I was stoned, but I seem to have pulled it off. The eye doctor didn't seem suspicious. Also, she ended up taking a closer look at my eyes to investigate the unaccounted-for redness and in doing so found a small scratch on my cornea that we are able to attend to without much trouble since we caught it so soon, so I guess all's well that ends well?",TIFU by going to the eye doctor stoned
267,tifu,"Alright, so this didn’t really happen today but a few months ago. My girlfriend lives kinda far away 3 hours with the train) and because of my final exams I didn’t have time to visit her at all.  Resulting in her sleeping over at my place 2 months after we started dating. (We had seen eachother before tho). 

We had sent eachother plenty of nudes and had already sexted about what we wanted to do to eachother so I kinda already knew that we would have sex. 

At night in bed she grinded on my d*ck naked but we couldn’t really do anything more because my parent’s bedroom was next to ours. So we agreed on having sex the next morning when my parents were gone. 

Because we planned it like that I started to get really nervous. 

When the morning arrived and she got naked I noticed that I couldn’t get an erection.  
I thought that it would maybe come when we kissed etc. But it still didn’t want to get hard. 

After a while and trying to masturbate it started to get a bit harder but everytime I would stop masturbating it would get flaccid in a few seconds. 

Because of this it was also impossible to put on a condom. I’m a grower and I need an xl condom when it’s erect but when it’s not it’s really tiny. (It grows 4 times the length with an erection). 

Eventually i succeeded on putting on the condom and as soon as I entered her body (so my deflowering) it just shrunk to a tiny ass worm again. 

Ofcourse I felt really ashamed so instead I thought it would be a good idea to maybe eat her out (so atleast she would enjoy it) I started licking and she liked it and I wanted to finger her at the same time since I read that online. BUT I STUCK MY FINGER IN HER AN*S. 

She jumped almost a meter in the air and that was also the moment that we stopped trying at all. 

Now we’re 7 months later and still together. Sex is amazing. It really is hard but after enough practice and getting to know what the other likes it starts getting easier. 



TL;DR my p*nis wouldn’t get erect and after a lot of tries I decided to eat her out which resulted in me accidentally fingering her an*s",TIFU by losing my virginity in the worst way possible.
268,tifu,"On mobile, sorry, etc.




This has been building up for 3 weeks, but I only just realized it last night. 






I had a baby almost 4 months ago. Unlike wild animals that come out walking, human babies are born useless and you must teach them how to do basic survival tasks like eating and sleeping. 






My baby mastered eating, but especially did not like sleeping. She preferred laying there, eyes wide open, turning her head, and making ""oo"" sounds. One night as I sat in the closet, distraught over how I gave birth to an owl, I hopped on the google. I found a slightly less restrictive straitjacket for babies and a creepy hybrid baby doll/glow worm that plays music. In my exhausted state, I decided these would be the best things to use in order to terrify my infant to sleep. 





Surprisingly, they worked. She sleeps for like 7 hours now. Here is how I realized my FU. 






3 nights ago: I put my baby in her fluffy straitjacket and turned on the worm. We both drifted off to sleep. 






2 nights ago: Baby is sleeping soundly and I cannot sleep. I am staring at her thinking ""Look how cute. I miss her. She's sleeping too well. Oh no, is she breathing???"" She moves. I then think ""You better not wake the hell up monster child."" I turn on the worm. We both fall asleep. 







Last night: I sneak into the room after baby is asleep. I turn on the worm in case I make noise getting into bed. I almost fall asleep and the worm turns off. Frustrated, I no longer can sleep. I turn the worm back on when baby shifts and I fall asleep before the worm shuts off this time.







I woke up this morning and the realization hit me. *I cannot sleep without the worm.* Husband also confirmed worm controls his sleeping as well. Let's hope it never breaks. 





TL;DR: baby wouldn't sleep, bought creepy worm/baby hybrid, wormbaby now controls all our abilities to sleep





Edit: lulled to sleep, woke up to awards (exciting, thank you!) and learned that these things control us all

I recently immigrated to the UK and have been struggling to get into a healthy workout routine. A friend of mine here has been trying to convince me to play touch rugby with him and his usual group in the park.

Finally made the decision to go this week as the incredible weather was too good to sit around inside.

Upon arriving at the park, I joined everyone in a warm up and noticed they were all putting rugby boots on. I didn't actually bring mine accross with me, and for some reason didn't think I would need them for touch rugby. I walk onto the pitch in my sneakers and immediately noticed how slippery the ground was.

We start playing and the time for my debut in the game has come. The opposite player is running towards me and starts to turn to the right. I shimmy to the side and get ready to take him on. Next thing I know I am lying on the ground, covered in mud and wishing I had a pair of rugby boots.

Needless to say, I ended up giving up playing so that I wouldn't injur my pride any further.

Something to know: Our school hasn’t won a single game in any sport this school year in months

So my school has a broadcasting network, it’s a club where we help out our teacher with broadcasting games to a state school network ish website, now up until Tuesday, I only did camera work which I was pretty good at since I have some experience recording stuff, so I decided to try out commentating for the first time, our teacher was like “alright, it’s good for you to try out new things” and I was gonna be commentating along with my 2 other friends who are much more experienced than me in this

I didn’t do very well for obvious reasons but the main thing that I did wrong was how I kept on unintentionally dissing the school, the most notable example was when my school (which I’ll just refer to as the diablitos due to our school’s mascot being a devil) was really surpassing the other school’s score during the basketball game, they were behind by 1 point, so my friend is like “So Faulty, the score is pretty close, what do you think?” And I was like “Yeah the score is pretty close and considering the past few games, I do hope the diablitos finally win a game” 

Immediately after I said it, I realized how bad it sounded, my friends just looked at me while trying not to lose their shit and somewhat mad at how I accidentally dissed the school, eventually we reached the half time and our teacher was like “alright guys you have 9 minutes” and my other friend said “that’s all the time I need” as he and my other friend tried to beat my ass for dissing the school like 5 times

Yes, I would like to work on improving my relationship with my parents instead of distancing myself, I agree with you. 

What do you think the best idea is for a great **bondage** experience with them?""

I had typed in some incorrect spelling like ""bondng"" and my crappy Android phone autocorrected to ""bondage"" implying some NSFW, incestuous actions.

Worse, my counselor thought I was pranking her, worsening the fuck-up DRAMATICALLY.

""That's disgusting, and I think this goes to show how little you take this seriously. We need to work on being able to seriously consider the fact you may be able to repair your relationship with them.

I was the only one to take photos, and they meant a lot to me. I went straight into panic mode, as I didn't know what to do as my photos were there. I tried to delete them from there. PERMANENTLY.

So this happened to me yesterday. I woke up, checked my phone and got a Facebook friend request from this girl that looked like someone I really liked. I accepted it, didn't think anything of it, and went to the supermarket where I took an employment test so I can get this job I desired. Anywhoozles, back to the point.

Me, being a concerned 19 year old paid that amount. Luckily, I paid it on the weekend so the banks weren't going to be open which bought me some time. I called the customer service to cancel that transaction, but even if I do it, I'm still afraid my reputation will be destroyed.

So every Friday night our fairly large family holds a little 'Game Night' to enjoy. My parents like the idea of it so we've done it ever since, and I cant say I don't enjoy it either. But 90% percent of every game includes no thinking and all yelling, whether it be a simple game of cards or Cards Against Humanity, no one can ever agree on the rules, and everyone hates each others answers.
This will be important.

Well,Last night was a bit of a spectacle for our families to be honest. We had over 25 people playing a game meant for 12, which I cant even remember the name of the game, because we actually had our older neighbors come over to play with us and give us it. I believe it was a ""Family Fued"" spinoff though, with ranked answers based off of the question.

As it got later in the night and we were getting a bit more rowdy, instead of waiting for turns people would straight up yell their answers, to no Ill contempt of the neighbors of course. The questions were getting a bit funnier and we were all having a good time, untill the final question of the night:

""Types of Pastas""
     _8 answers_


Well, we had gotten all of them except for the last two types, and the other team was about to steal our hard worked pasta points, so in my mind it suddenly clicked, I had remembered the one pasta that no one else had said. I mean if 'Rigatoni' was one that had been said, it seemed my answer could be plausible right?

So as everyone is trying to figure out the answers I boldly proclaim:

NIGATONI


let's just say the game night ended there with yelling and embarrassment on my side, with my neighbors essentially thinking I'm a racist who said it for jokes. :l

277,tifu,"To start off, I’m on my mobile so apologies for any mistakes etc.

Basically, my friend is a hardcore fisherman, and goes out at least 3 times a week. He often asks me or anyone out of our friend group to just go for a few hours to get out, but most don’t like the smells, dark etc. 

I decided that since tonight was a quiet night, and not many people would be out due to the rain that I would head along with him. He picked me up, we bought bait, snacks and drinks than headed to the spot he chose. 

To make the imagine clearer. We’re fishing under a bridge, which is 4 lanes wide, and at least 800m long. There’s a foot path directly under the bridge near the main frame of the bridge, and next to the path is small boulders all the way around for fisherman. This was my first f*ck up. 

We got all our gear, walked down and around the footpath to find a spot. Picked one, and sat down. We set up the rods, got the bait ready, had a cigarette and beer or two than he started lure fishing while I sat on my phone on reddit. This is my second major f*ck up. 

Basically, the entire rocks that stretch for 200m is full of gigantic rats. They live off of fisherman’s bait and small insects. I’ve been there many times before and only seen a few, but this time everytime I looked up, 10 were starring back at me. 

I kept chucking cans around (which I went and picked back up, including more), and making noises until the rats finally stopped ganging up on me for a while. I decided to pull out my phone and head on reddit. I was reading a long AskReddit post, not moving, just using my finger to scroll up and down. 

Then without even seeing it out of my side vision, a giant rat with about a 15cm long body as well as a 15cm long tail, jumped up on my leg. I instantly screamed, swung my back hand at the rat and it flew into the closest fishing rod, got caught in the line and struggled its way to the floor before running for dear life back to the rocks. 

I instantly broke into tears, ripped of my pants to check for bites or scratches, and by ripped I mean broke in half. I then started packing up all the fishing gear crying about going home, then having instant relaxation and sitting back down and going back onto reddit while surveying my surroundings every minute. After around 5 minutes of relaxation I realised my cheap tights were ruined, and if anyone walked in front of me they would get a good view of my underwear, inner legs and inner calf’s. I used my ripped pants to make a skirt of sorts, and stayed for another hour before becoming anxious again and begging my friend to leave. He complied because he said it would have been terrifying and he’s been debating it the last hour. 

I love animals and felt extremely bad. I watched him scurry away and he was completely fine or I would have been even more hysterical if I hurt him. I just had to add this just in case.

My girlfriend tends to get kinda loud when we have sex. I am not super loud but I guess she’s into it so it’s whatever.

The weather today has been slightly rainy with a drizzle. We went out to eat and got brunch and sat in her car and listened to music as we watched the rain fall on the moonroof. It was pretty romantic, so we went inside and sat on the patio and drank some wine and watched the storm come in.

Things started to get hot and heavy so we went inside and started doing the deed. I remember stopping at some point wondering if anyone was by the pool and could hear because she was being EXTRA loud today and we both laughed about it and agreed to be a little quieter but not much.

We finish up and I walk into the kitchen and my jaw completely drops. We had left the door to the patio and pool WIDE OPEN. The entire complex had to have heard. There is zero chance that they didn’t. My face is completely red and I could not be more embarrassed.

So I was a student and one of my flatmates was this hippy girl called Lorna. Her boyfriend was a baker and she'd often bring cakes to the house and share them with the rest of us. Among my other flatmates was this lanky guy called Alex, and we used to prank each other all the time, hiding in cupboards to give us frights, putting spicy sauce in each other's food, etc.

One morning Lorna leaves a cake in the kitchen and Alex takes a slice without asking, assuming it would be ok. He confesses this to me, and seeing an opportunity to prank him I make a scandalised face and say ""Are you crazy? That cake was for a birthday party, she is going to be SO mad!"" And this works because he actually begins to fret about it. 

Later that day I walk in the kitchen and find an apology note on the cake-box by Alex and so of course I take a pen, call him a complete dumbass, and sign myself as Lorna. The next morning I find another apology note, and yet again I take perverse pleasure in insulting him and making him believe it's Lorna.

None of this back-and-forth would have been of any consequence if it weren't that right after leaving the cake in the house, Lorna and her boyfriend went for some hippy-trip in the woods. After spending the night shagging in the wild, they awoke to find their car wouldn't start and their cell-phones had died (this was 2004, before batteries lasted a week and portable chargers were around). On the way back they also managed to get lost. In other words they disappeared, and the worried families called the police.

So the police comes to our apartment and we all tell them that we haven't seen seen Lorna for days, except that idiot Alex who comes to the front door with a swag and laughs ""nothing to worry about officers, Lorna's been in the house, I can guarantee it!"" (This is where if I hadn't been so young and so much of an asshole I really should have said something, I know...). Since his story doesn't hold, the police come back the next morning (when I'm not there) and Alex begins to recount his version again before suddenly realising halfway that I had pranked him and switching stories in a panic, looking like some psycho. If Lorna hadn't reappeared that same morning I'm pretty sure he would have been arrested. This counts as a FU for myself because when I came home that evening Alex assaulted me. He got me in an armlock and we thrashed the kitchen and to this date that remains the only time I was laughing hysterically while being beaten up.

283,tifu,"So I'm a pretty average person all around, with the exception that I'm tall (6'4"").  I consider myself of average intelligence, average looks, average sense of humor, average dick size.

Really the only other dicks I've seen are a) in porn, and b) a couple of buddies on a skinny dipping night.  In all cases I'm smaller.  I already know some comments are gonna be all ""But what about in the locker room?"" what locker rooms are you in that everyone is running around balls out naked?  My gym has individual showers and change areas, there's very occasionally someone getting changed in the common area, but I'm not staring at their junk, and yeah, every so often I see someone smaller than me, but that reinforced my viewpoint that I'm extremely average.  Okay, back to the story.

Recently I got divorced, I had been with my ex wife for 16 years.  She was my first, and the only woman I'd ever been with.  Whenever we used condoms I'd always dread it.  I mean, all guys say the same thing about them right?  There's no feeling, difficult staying hard, everyone hates condoms.  I just assumed that was the universal truth, and it never occurred to me to investigate further.  Every time I had to put one on I'd start to go flaccid, apologize, and work really hard to perform.  Sex was bad, often way more work than it was worth.

Well, recently I met a woman on Tinder.  She has more experience than I do.  Before meeting she asked about my size and I answered honestly, I'm super average.  She said that's cool, and we went on a date.  At the end of it we hooked up, and there I am trying to put on a condom, same thing as usual happening, struggling to roll it down, starting to go flaccid, getting embarrassed, when she points out that apparently I'm incorrect, not average, and am wearing the wrong sized condoms.  I wrote it off, I thought she was just being polite and trying to give me an ego boost to help be not feel so bad.  At our next encounter she handed me a larger condom.  Holy fucking shit.  What the fuck.  I no longer feel like I'm about to be swung into battle by an enraged Gimli.

Yes, I recognize the humble brag, but what a fucking waste of 16 years.  I'm more pissed about that, then I am 'happy' about my dick size.  I'm elated about this problem being fixed, and want to jump for joy and tell my friends, but who can I possibly tell without sounding like a giant bragging douche?  Nobody, so instead I'm telling you, I'm fine with sounding like a douche to you.

TL;DR - Wasted 16 years having terrible sex cause I was wearing condoms that were too small.

&amp;#x200B;

edit - A lot of people are reading this as though I'd never had sex without a condom, which isn't the case.  My ex wife was on and off birth control for a myriad of reasons.  When she was on all was good, when she was off I was in a frequent battle with the Scranton Strangler.",TIFU by wearing the wrong size condoms for 16 years

Obligatory “this happened yesterday not today”.


So I’m a huge guitar nerd (I’ve been playing well over 3/4 of my life) and have always been really interested in guitar effects pedals and pedalboards etc but never had the money to afford to invest in any myself. 

After some hard budgeting and struggling through the last few months financially I finally had a decent chunk of cash to lay down on some gear that I’ve had my eye on for a long while. I play guitar in a band and have been looking forward to investing in my own playing for a change. I travelled up to my university city to buy a guitar pedalboard, power supply and a couple of pedals totalling in £403. In my excitement I forgot that I’d stowed away this board (it came with a soft case) in the overhead storage on the train back home. By the time I realised this I was already halfway to work with absolutely no possibility of missing it to go to the terminating station and reclaim the bag. 

Fast forward to this morning and the station does not have it, apparently they didn’t find it despite being the next station on the journey with hardly anyone left in the carriage, and the only slim possibility is if it somehow turns up in the Waterloo lost property office in the next 5 days or so...

As a perpetually poor uni student, this was an unbelievable scale FU for me considering how long I’ve wanted to own this, and I never even got to play through it.

Pay attention to what you have guys, maybe there’s at least a song in all this...

285,tifu,"This happened about 6 or 7 years ago when I was around 13/14
I’ll start with a little backstory. I went camping, ended up meeting someone who ended up being my best friend, met his family, and ended up having a massive crush on his sister. 

Fun camping trip. I saw her quite often, and as the months went on, and I was seeing my friends family more, that obviously meant I got to see her more. She’d laugh at all the silly jokes I make, touch my arm, and be generally flirty around me. 
I never noticed... 

my best friend, her brother, said she liked me, and gave me some tips on how to get her to like me more, etc. 
When I was with another friend, he called her, and she asked to speak to me, obviously because she liked me...

I never noticed... 

She’d message me during her breaks at school. It’s fair to see at this point I was infatuated with her, and couldn’t think about anything or anyone else. 

Here’s where it goes wrong... very wrong...

One day, during her break at school, we were messaging. I mentioned a piece of music I recently heard, and said “you should listen, it’s beautiful! ❤️” (the music was sleepers awake by Bach) 
She messaged back this: 
“Aww, you actually sent a love heart! ❤️💕💘💖💞💍”

Now... a normal person who is infatuated with someone who just pretty well made their feelings known, would NOT do what I did... and yes, I still regret it to this day... every day... lol

I said... 
“The love heart was actually for the music, but you can have one too ❤️”

...

...

She replied back “aww thanks mate, ur lush x”

That was it. That was my chance... gone. 

Quite a while later, I asked if she actually liked me, she said only as friends. My chance had gone. Forever. And yes, I’m still single. 


TL;DR
Girl I like pretty well expresses her feelings for me, I accidentally friend zone her, and lost my chance forever.","TIFU by accidentally friend zoning a girl I was infatuated with and ruining my chances of being with her, forever"
286,tifu,"Obligatory, this was actually a decade ago, but it still haunts me. Also, this is my first post, but long time lurker. Tl;dr below.

I had my first child very young. She was maybe 2 at the time of this FU and I would have been early 20s. Her dad and I are both nerds but on different sides of that spectrum. He loved Star Wars, so much so that we might have even been dressed as characters from the movie when she was conceived. That's probably important later.

So one day I'm driving to go visit my best friend who lives 2 hours away; all highway. I start to hear a funny noise coming from my car, and I'm like ""great of course this happens now."" I was pretty sure I knew what it was, there was a plastic piece underneath that I had knocked loose and knew that it had been randomly dragging. So I pull over like a moron on the shoulder of the interstate to look, hands and knees, underneath my car. That piece is loose but not dragging and I dont see any other issues so I get back in the car. Start to drive again, the noise comes back. 

Let me back track and say that I have worked at the same place since I graduated high school and my coworkers are literally my family. One of the older women I work with had recently been on a trip to California with her old-ladies-read-the-smut book club thing she was in and came back with gifts. So we are all crowded around and she gives another girl like a jar with some sand in it, and another person some other beach related thing. She turns to me and says ""uh, I'll give you yours later."" But why?

I like to think I'm a good girl (lol) but my kids dad ruined me and I got a little wild after I had her. I also have a very amazing ability to just pick the most horrible but hilarious people to date or sleep with. It's a gift. Like the gift she gave me...which was a gigantic pink vibrating dildo. 

This thing needed a pull start. It had rotating beads, a swiveling head, I'm pretty sure you could make it hot or cold...this thing was unreal and I was terrified of it. Also WHY THE FUCK DID YOU GO TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU BOUGHT ""LISA"" A BAG OF SAND AND YOU THOUGHT I NEEDED A GIANT DICK?!

I'm still not sure why, but I also couldnt ever use it because I'd think about her and shes not my cup of tea. So I put it in a bag and put it in my trunk never to be seen again.

Or so I thought.

I had wondered why everyone on the interstate was looking at me like I was insane. I thought it was because they could see that my car was about to explode so they were telling me with their stink eyes. No. My daughter was using the giant vibrator as a light saber in the back seat and ""slicing"" all the other cars. My car wasnt falling apart. She just had it on turbo-blaster-gut-fuck mode. 

No idea how it got out of the trunk but I made sure it found a home in a dumpster.

Today, I went to my local Frys (grocery store) with a few friends of mine and bought a few drinks, as we were biking and were pretty thirsty. We were headed to another friends house and nearly all of us were thirsty as hell. Anyways, we picked out our drinks and were headed to the register. The self-checkouts were packed for the first time, so we went into a lane with a cashier.

A few hours earlier I had sent a message to our group chat with no context that was a picture of James Charles nude. (You know the one.)

Anyways, one of my friends had gone through first and just got a message on his phone. Another friend had messaged the group chat. He opened the message to see a picture above of James Charles's rear. The cashier raised both of her eyebrows, and my friend's face went red. All of us were laughing our asses off, except for him and the cashier. He left his bottle on the conveyer belt, and left.

So, this happened a few hours ago. I'm at work and we are currently a bit busy so I'm sorta rushing around doing stuff. A couple come in asking about face masks to protect against volcanic ash. Because it's a weekend there's only me and one other guy working and he is currently busy with 2 customers and I need to help him, so I want to move these guys out as quick as possible. They hand me a box of masks (notice the ""s"" at the end of masks). I quickly scan the box and tell them its a P2 grade (no idea what that means) but the lady Google's it and it would protect against volcanic ash. Great. I look at the box and tell them its $4.80, i think to myself ""damn this box is kinda big for just one mask but okay whatever i need to hurry"". they grab a second box and I charge them and they leave. Great now I can help my co worker and get on with my day. except a few hours later I realise my fuck up, each box actually contains 10 masks, and they are $4.80 EACH, meaning I essentially gave away 18 masks for free and lost my boss about $84 dollars in profits. Now I'm home, ive messaged my boss asking him to call me and I'm dreading that conversation

289,tifu,"My husband and I went to an Anime convention in California today. We walked one way and instantly got caught up on the first booth. Free roll and $1 after got us hooked. All we needed to do was win 100 points. 

The game was easy, you use the cup attached at the end of a pole to pull out a ball with a number, and the number is associated to a chart. Simple, yeah. We used our free rolls to get 50 points. 

The guy continued to sweet talk us to keep going for $1. Even throwing in a free round. I fell for it. We were like sure. Then we won some ""bonus"" and the price went to $5, but we would win $140 in return. My husband wanted to wind the money back so he kept going. We were also at 85 out of 100 to win all our cash back.

About 20 balls later, a bunch of ""bonus"" balls and the prize money going to $1,800, the balls costs $160. We stopped. Because my pocket money for the convention was gone. 

When we paused, the guy gave us two free prices (2x Funko Pops that aren't worth how much we paid) and a ticket to ""resume"" later. Which we probably aren't. We calculated how much we spent too.

290,tifu,"This actually happened a few years ago in ninth or tenth grade, and I wanted to post this on my main but I can't bring myself to do it.

So, basically, I'm a furry, and for the past few years I was reading this comic called oversexed eeveelutions by kuroodod. the premise is about an Eevee who lives with one of each of the eeveelutions, and he has sex with all of them. When the main character, Sam the Eevee, got to the Flareon named pride, they decided to do anal sex. For some reason, I find anal sex super hot, especially when it's drawn, and drawn well, and this guy's a great artist. now, this comic was on a weekly update basis so the most recent page was basically pride displaying her asshole and telling Sam to go in it. Now, I have a friend who I am very sexually open with, and I wanted to tell her about it over Snapchat. somehow, I didn't realize who I was clicking on, because there's a girl with a different name, but at a glance it looks similar. So without thinking I type ""OSE is moving to anal, my favorite!"". this was before Snapchat allowed you to delete messages, so after about 5 minutes I realized what I did and freaked out because obviously I had to go to school with this girl. So I just say to her, ""LMAO that was a joke my friend told me to.""

Needless to say She blocked me, but I think she may have forgotten about it because even though I'm out of school now and we never talk to each other we're still quite nice when we do.

I was an avid skateboarder, never did tricks or anything but took the long way home to skate.
Anyways i got out of class and the weather was over cast with a chance of rain. 
The possibility of rain never stopped me, I had skated many times in it before without any negative consequences.
So i begin to skateboard jome and decide to stop by Jack in the Box to grab a quick bite.

As im waiting for my meal it begins to rain lightly, im unphased at this moment because whats a little rain going to do to me.

I grab my burger and i get the bright idea to skate and eat at the same time, so i could make it home before it decides to rain harder.

I get through 2 blocks without an issue but on the third block i take a bite of my burger and stepin the puddle at the same time.

Of course my right leg slips and i roll my ankle
Next thing you know im falling face first into my half eaten Chicken-n-tater melt.

As im on the floor i see my skateboard roll into the street only for it to get crushed by a big diesel truck. 

Now im laying on the side walk with a swollen ankle, with sauce all over my face and shirt laying in the rain praying nobody i know saw me.
Im laying crying in pain unable to get up because i cant walk.

Shortly after a lady comes up to me sayjng she saw the whole thing and called an ambulance for me.

At this point i decide to lay there with a sauced face to wait for the paramedics to arrive.
Sure enough they show up to a 16 year old boy with what looks like a facial soaked by the rain top to bottom.

292,tifu,"First TIFU, apologies in advance. 

Seven days ago I started IF (Intermittent Fasting). I heard most people are eating for 6-10 hours a a day and may or may not be losing weight but over the long run are seeing benefits such as reduced blood pressure and reduced chances of getting diabetes. All three of these issues are things that wouldn’t hurt me to work on and I’m a big fan of shortcuts. This is the story of how it began and where it probably ended. 

The previous Saturday I completed a “walk to see a rock” that ended up being a 7 hour, 14 km hike across cliff faces and through dense forest, I managed to see a Bronze Age stone carving, an early 20th century obelisk for setting naval compasses and a coastal battery all while on a diet that consisted of two protein bars and a bottle of water. 

On my way home I grabbed some pork and rice (char siu faan for those also in HK) which I couldn’t even finish. When out with friends later I had trouble eating again because I was so full and tired. This is when I decided if I could do all that with so little food that I could do it again. Not to mention many of my friends are already doing IF and who isn’t a fan peer pressure :) The next day I gave it a go. Made it to 2 pm before I needed to eat and had another small meal that evening around 6 pm. I thought I could replicate this at work and so I did. 

All week long I would eat between 12-1 and stop eating either with that meal or within the next few hours. In the beginning of the week it was more towards a four hour window but as the week went on I learned I didn’t even need that. One day I even tried to go no carb and my body pretty much shut down (warning signs much?). I had a painful headache all day no matter how much water I drank it didn’t improve. I couldn’t focus and couldn’t even keep my eyes open. The one salad all day was not enough for me and the next day I went back to adding in sweets (I’m a chocolate addict - yes I know it’s horrible for me and the last thing I should be eating while dieting is cake) and carbs and I was a lot better. I was losing weight each day. Not a requirement but it was nice to see. By Friday I was down 8.6 lbs but I started at 260+ lbs so percentage wise it was alright. 

I thought there was no way I could keep going out with friends without eating dinner (the five guys one was the hardest) while I sit there and either drink water or just stare and drool while I test my own willpower. I decided that the weekend will be my cheat. Right up until midnight on Friday. Friday came and went without any hiccups and Saturday I met a friend for lunch around 1 pm. Wasn’t hungry so I didn’t snack much after but come the evening I did break into a little sweets stash and filled my mouth quite promptly. Today (Sunday) I decided I’m still losing weight and closing in on an arbitrary goal of 245 lbs so I should keep going. I thought what if I can go for a jog AND hit the gym today. I tried to get some stuff done in the apartment in the AM and come lunch time I was ready to go. I had a some water in the AM but nothing drastic because if I eat or drink too much before a jog I get horrible cramps. I was out the door and attempted my “normal” route. By normal I mean I do this a few times a year and it’s about 4km. I haven’t jogged in probably three or four months (bad knees and ankles and flat footed - I know, excuses) but figured as I weighed a little less it should be easier. I started out at a slow yet maintainable pace and it was quite cool so I felt good. I tried my normal route but due to on going circumstances (cough HK police state cough) several of my paths were blocked. No big deal I’m sure I can find a way around. And around the backup route that is also blocked. Eventually my ankle begins to hurt so I sit for 30 seconds while I stretch and roll it and then I’m back at it. Jogging along the waterfront in Admiralty past all the riot gear donning police (they are actually everywhere). I push through taking some quick jog walk jog transitions when the inclines/stairs get the better of me or my ankle stops cooperating. I pass a lot of people out on Sunday with friends enjoying food in the parks. Several of the Filipino buffet spreads are catching a few of my senses. Towards the end of this jog there is an overpass that has roughly 2.5 stories of stairs on either side. I usually try to run up it at an increased pace but with version 2.0 of me I figure I mine as well sprint it at top speed. I think I did everything short of naruto running to get up there as fast as I could. I was double stepping and my fingers were locked and aligned as if I was Usain Bolt going for yet another gold. I made it to the top jogged down the opposite side and slowed coming down the stairs with my arms above my head to help with my breathing. I jogged the last one minute back to my building. As the building came within sight after turning a corner I again sprinted but this time more of a “going to miss my bus” pace than the “I stole something”  haste. I stopped the Nike Run Club app (yet another miss calculated run - thanks for nothing Nike) as I made my way into the lobby and onto a chair.

I was out of breath. I couldn’t talk. My mouth was open to facilitate the deep breaths and I was dripping sweat. After a minute I can feel a little light headed and cotton mouthed. I get to me feet and head for the elevator. I instantly notice I’m not moving like I was before. I don’t want to wait and I see the odd floor elevator door open and I take it. I figure I can just go one floor up and then take the stairs down a flight. As the elevator ascends I can feel my light headed ness increasing. I already feel my vision being distorted. I couldn’t believe how quickly this was happening. Five mins prior I was on an adrenaline high and I was fine. I’m feeling a desperate need for water. I manage to peel my shirt off before the doors open and I stumble my way down the hall. I can’t remember it clearly I just remember hurrying as my hearing also starts to go. I make it to the stair well and every noise my feet make as it touches a steep sounds like a screech to me. My eyes feel wide open but vision looks like they are closing. I make my way down the stairs in through my door. I wasn’t able to fully close it behind me but I grab a jug of water and collapse to the floor. I am lying on the ground and I immediately twist the lid of the 5L bottle open and pour the water over more than just my mouth. I gulp it down and then again. I still feel out of it. I realised I NEEDED energy. I laid out a protein bar on the couch for after my run but before the gym (no way that’s happening now) I roll towards the couch and reach for the bar on the arm of the sofa. I tore it open and managed to get a bite of it off into my mouth. I attempt to chew but then just wash it down with more water.

For the first time during this whole event I am feeling better. After a few mins I remember I have one of those Gatorade liquid energy packs somewhere in a kitchen cabinet. I rummaged through a pile of snacks with no concern whatsoever ever until I could find it. I ripped the top off and over the course of a few attempts I squeezed the contents into my mouth. I realised it was food that I really needed. I made my way to the fridge and devoured half a box of Royce Nama Chocolate - Port Charlotte Scottish Barley - my favourite flavour and a waste but delicious and required none the less. I washed it all down with a carton of soy milk and then made my way back to the floor while I fully came back to. 

I honestly didn’t know what was going to happen. In the stairwell I thought this is where they are going to find me 5 hours later and I’ll wake up in a hospital. It was one of the scariest moments of my life. If I fall and hot my head that could be it. 

I learned the hard way why runners always carb load before hand and that fasting and intense exercise don’t go well together. If you are going to try IF, do it for a reasonable number of hours in a day and never push yourself to your limits while fasting. Your body needs more than just reserves if it’s going to perform. Be responsible and you won’t be lying on the floor worrying about ever getting up again :)

294,tifu,"To give some back story, when it comes to dating I'm used to meeting someone a few times before anything even happens. I like getting to know the person before the hanky panky.

I moved to Charlotte NC a while ago and it's been difficult meeting people. I'm from NYC where I have a good group of friends and their friends and that's how I usually meet people. Being in a new city with no one I knew, I resorted to Tinder (first time ever) to finding a date and someone to talk with. Last month I matched with Katie (her tinder name, not real name). Only match that actually spoke back and felt like a real person than a bot or someone who wanted a sugar daddy.

I like the bio, had similar interests, we're both engineers, her being sort of an ex morman and me confused muslim/agnostic?, anime, etc. We chatted a bit and decided to get ramen and drinks. I was supposed to meet her at Wooden Robot for a drink first at 7:30. I texted her around 5 to confirm, she said she'll be late and if 8 is okay, I said yea and I got to the place around 7:15 and waited. Around 7:45, I get a text saying if we can reschedule as her dog is sick.

I felt like crap thinking I got baited into just wasting my time for someone who ghosted me but I was polite about it and we were both busy till after Christmas. Went home feeling like crap that day thinking this city sucks and being a brown/south asian man doesn't make it any easier.

Real story begins here. Couple days later she asks me if I'm doing anything tonight, she invites me over to her place to play board games and hang out. I drove over, contemplating if I was going to get robbed, mugged, kidneys stolen but it paid off when she opened the door and she looked great. The board game was missing pieces but she was okay with just talking (first hint?)

She ordered sushi, we talked and ate, offered a sour beer and said ""I'm usually tipsy after like one of these"" (second hint?, maybe she didn't want to drink a lot). I admired her manga collection, talking about old school consoles, the amazing art she drew and hung on the wall. My mind went from ""how does a hookup work"" to ""shit I might actually like this girl, she's cool and interesting"".

I never hooked up on the first night so it was weird to me liking someone who had similar interests and I got nervous as fuck. Where I also fucked up was suggesting we watch some anime. I asked her if she watched Shokugeki no Soma/Food Wars and chromecasted episode 1 which if you know anything about the show can make a date go either ways due to the food orgasms.

Third hint was Katie dimming/turning off? the lights and lighting some candles and talking about one of the candles that made wood crackling noises as it was lit and how romantic it seemed. At that point we've been talking for a couple hours and I wanted to sit next to her and get comfortable but she put her dog there a few minutes back so many she doesn't want to move on. After a while she said she needed to get to bed, trying to salvage things I asked her what she's looking for and she said nothing serious or anything and it led to ME friend zoning her.

I left.

Got back in my car thinking how badly I fucked that up and realizing I really wanted to kiss her. I got home and texted her. I'll only explain 3 more things.

First is I was Christmas shopping and thought of getting her this my neighbor totoro sweater I saw but the way I executed this was creepy.

Second was my lease was expiring so I can move closer to the city now. Her neighborhood was pretty safe.

Third was maybe a fucking meme to convince her to hit retry but fuck man.

These screenshots will make more sense.[https://imgur.com/a/dpXG1Pl](https://imgur.com/a/dpXG1Pl)

In the end I realized how disgustingly creepy I became and even now I'm just ashamed of myself for somehow being that way. Even now after a few week of a couple other tinder matches/dates I realized it's hard to find normal people you can actually talk to. I'd rather apologize to her in person but I feel like that would just be even more creepy showing up to her apartment to apologize.

TIFU This is really gross at certain parts. I am also grossed out by my actions almost 10 years later. It was a flight from New York to Spain. While at the New York airport, I was at a bar drinking wine. I was traveling alone, so I started talking to strangers at the bar. Time goes by and I don’t know how many glasses of wine I’ve had or how many got bought for me. 

Time to board the airplane. I sit down and things are fine. They pass out a meal since it’s an international flight. To this day, I don’t know if it was the wine or food that did it. I had the window seat and the person next to me was out cold. I started feeling very hot and sick. It gets gross here, so stop reading if you are squeamish. Suddenly, I threw up. I didn’t have a barf bag and it was in my mouth still. My cheeks were full, I didn’t have a bag, so I swallowed it. I hate myself for that. Came back up and I hardly got it into the bag. I got some on myself, but I was able to clean it up right away. I ended up having to straddle the female passenger(I’m female) next to me to get to the bathroom over and over. The flight was at 10PM, a little over 8 hours, and I didn’t sleep at all. I repeatedly kept getting sick over and over.

I finally got a chance to go to the flight attendant cabin and ask for anti nausea medication. None of the crew spoke fluent English. They didn’t know what I meant. I said I was very sick and made a hand mouth movement, so they gave me a can of Coke. I sat back down and went to the bathroom to throw that up. Another few hours pass and I need more bags, I’m in the bathroom over and over again, straddling my sleeping seat partner, and nothing is working. 

30 minutes until we land, I start feeling so incredibly hot that I realize I need to tell someone. Last thing I remember was walking up to the front of the plane towards a flight attendant, saying this plane is so hot out loud in the middle of the aisle, and then I woke up with an attendant holding my legs in the air. I passed out from being sick the entire plane ride and while I was out they did the “is there a doctor on board.” There was and he was from Maryland, so he spoke english. He said to the flight attendants that I had a vomit stain on my shirt and was likely dehydrated from being sick. I said I had been sick for the entire plane. He gave me some pepto bismo, some one got me water or juice, and I returned to my seat. I got off the plane in Madrid, got some water from the airport, caught my connecting flight, and I made it to Jerez in one piece. I think about that every time I fly on an airplane.

TL;DR - Got sick on a plane from New York to Spain, passed out, and a flight attendant held my legs up while the doctor they found on board gave me pepto bismo.",TIFU and ended up with a flight attendant holding my legs up in the air
296,tifu,"The last post someone made in here reminded me of a ridiculous time in my life a few years ago when I worked at Massage Envy. I will try and keep it short and simple and leave some of the drama out. Maybe one or two of you lurkers will get a chuckle. :)

Basically we were in the middle of a big change in bosses and the woman they brought in was legit questionable. She was a model for the majority of her life and helped run some businesses that I dont remember after that and for whatever reason wound up at my store. My coworkers were the *drama bombers* and decided that I was a bitch and would make my days difficult as all hell. They wanted me gone and it was miserable for me but I got along with everyone else and they kept me sane. 

Well one day me and the Drama Bombers were talking and somehow the topic of taco pizza came up. They said they've never heard of it and I grew up loving that pizza and wasnt going to let someone not know this pizza existed... so I googled it on the front desk computers. We arent supposed to use them for anything other than work related searches, but I figured it would take 2 seconds and was better than breaking the strict no phone at the desk policy. It was a slow day and figured itd be fine. They were enlightened and I thought that was that. 

Until a couple days later I get called into the office by the Boss exModel. She has me take a seat and is very solemn. I'm confused as all hell and at this time in my life, was very meek and the thought of getting ""in trouble"" caused anxiety so I was sweatin big time. Until she spoke.

""OP, you know why I brought you in here and what has to be done but I just have to know... *why*??""

The cluelessness sinks in deeper, ""uh, no?""

""Oh come on! You know. I just want to know why you did it.""

""I'm being honest. I have zero clue what you're talking about.""

Finally she throws out her hands toward me and heatedly whispers, ""**the taco pizza*!""

""The.. taco pizza...?"" 

""Dont play dumb, what even *is* that? The girls told me you were using the computer internet on the clock and, OP, I didnt *want* to believe them but you know how I found out?"" Yall, I'm not exaggerating, this woman had that Disney evil glint in her eye that I thought was reserved for animated characters about to reveal their big scheme, ""Every computer saves what you search and after a bit of digging...I found your search history...and there it was! Taco. Pizza.""

""Taco... pizza.""

""Yes! You have to tell me what that means.""

""....its pizza....""

She rolls her eyes, ""Yeah, sure. Okay, look. I don't know what taco pizza is---""

""*its pizza*""

""--but I'm not dumb enough to believe it's just some pizza. We both know that. I dont know what kind of weird slang you're pulling over us but that isnt acceptable here. Its frankly disgusting. THIS IS A PLACE OF WORK, not your own personal time to look up that taco nonsense.""

She waved me off and the next day the assistant manager, bless her, calls me in the office. She tells me that I'm being fired for using the computers. I like this lady, she is super nice and a great manager and she looked all sorts of annoyed at the situation. She told me I'm better off cuz they were all insane and she told me to run for the hills. I was still pretty numbed out to it all. I mean... what did she think taco pizza was? Like some weird lesbian sexual act?

 It's been years and it's one of my favorite ""you wont believe THIS happened"" stories when people share their work history. The icing on the cake was that Boss exModel called me 2 weeks later to rehire me, saying that she thinks I ""learned my lesson"" and needed me back. Schyeah. Okay. 


TLDR: coworkers didnt know what a taco pizza was, so I used the work computer to google it for them to see. They complained to the manager about me, she confirmed I searched it in google, and after I wouldnt give her ""more information"" on what taco pizza ""really"" meant, I was fired.",TIFU by showing my coworkers what taco pizza was
297,tifu,"This didn’t happen today but it did happen yesterday. Also sorry for any spelling mistakes, English is my first language but I suck at it. 

  Something u need to know is I’m known for having pretty bad emotional fits my gf has super bad anxiety. Also we are both transgender which isn’t super relevant but I thought I would mention it. 

  So my gf and I had broken up a few days before and we’re trying to be friends. We we’re at the mail with one of are mutual friend (we’ll call him joe, cuz that’s his name) we’re at the mail and I got a bit emotional. She asked if I needed space and I said yes. Her and joe went to the game shop. And wail I was crying my friend Eve just happened to come by. She sat at my side and offered to buy me something at the food court (she knows that I love food). Her and I left where I was sitting and went to get something. I was still in eye line of where I was sitting so I assumed it was ok. Now you need to understand that my gf has very bad anxiety and she gets nauseous when she’s worried. So I’m waiting for my food to be prepared I hear a frantic scream “OP!!”..... “OP?!?”. I looked over and see them I screamed “yeah?” In retrospect I should of realized they didn’t hear me. They kept looking around and I thought they saw me so when she put her head in the trash I thought it was a joke. But as I got closer I realized she was projectile vomiting. Into the trash. The woman behind her was horrified and the janitor behind her looked so fucking amazed like “shit I’m gonna haft to clean that up but still dam bra.” Anyway she pulls her head out of the trash but of the trash and saw me. She came over and hugged me saying something like “I was so worried” she was then went back and put her head in the trash and throw up again. It was the funniest thing I ever saw and immediately we we’re laughing and smiling again. 

  One more thing we saw that same janitor putting on heavy duty gloves to clean up me gfs sick. Also it broke the ice between us so hard that we’re able to talk through are problems and we’re back together again.

298,tifu,"It's a long story so if you want the TL:DR is at the bottum

So my family is moving to another house and currently we are packing everything, including our garage. In the corner of our garage is a tall metal shelf. It's wedged between the refrigerator and the wall where it is slightly elevated. The shelf is held together with bolts and nuts. So one person has to hold the nut on one side with the wrench while the other has to unscrew the bolt on the other side. My aunt was there to hold the the nut while I unscrewed it. 

     Now the normal, sane thing to do would be to be take off the inner shelves then take the whole frame apart. Me, thinking I'm a smart boi, decides why not take all the nuts out but leave the bolts in. This way it would be easier take it all apart all at once. It sounded better in my head. So we took all the nuts out on one side and had to move it to get to the other side. But it all was about to fall apart in front of my aunt. The shelf was about to fall on her but I got in front and held it. Everything on that side was coming apart so I had to hold it in the weirdest way possible. It looked like I was doing this weird ass yoga pose. Everything in my body was tense. Buns of steel. So for 10 minutes I looked like an idiot holding it while my aunt and dad undid the rest of the shelf. 

TL:DR: I took apart shelf pretty weird because I thought I was being smart. It was going to fall on my aunt out, almost taking her out but I held it in place.

299,tifu,"This happened just this morning.

My car was in tip-top shape until about a year ago I brought it into the dealership to get my tires replaced. The day I pulled off the lot my brakes started squealing like a banshee (they made zero sounds beforehand), so CLEARLY something they did at the dealership caused this problem. They said give it some time, and gave me the runaround saying it was normal and there was really no fix until I eventually gave up, but it was embarrassing pulling up to a stop and SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEAK as people turned their heads to look. As I said, I am 100% CERTAIN something they did during the tire change service caused this because it was night and day the minute I drove off the lot.

I had found the noise distracting, but I tried living with it for a year before I had enough. So I finally decided to bring the car back in and demand a fix.

So, I bring the car into the shop and the service adviser gives me the same spiel that brake squealing is normal even though I explained that it didn't start until I drove it out of service at their dealership at which point it was immediately noticeable. I had to escalate all the way to the service manager who gave me the same spiel and was not willing to acknowledge that their service department or the job they did could in any way be part of the cause - which I wasn't having.

The service manager asked how often I brake hard and early - and I told him never. He said that's what I needed to do. I got very direct with him that I expected them to fix this and so the service manager offered to personally take it out on the freeway and clear off some of the dust by going high speed and jamming on the brakes - ""that should clear out the dust and stop the squealing"" he said.

I was wiling to let him do that, so he took it out and came back around 15 minutes later. Since the brakes were warm, I won't know if it's better until tomorrow but I made the service manager promise to replace the entire brake pads and rotors if this didn't work (which he really didn't feel was necessary or would help but reluctantly agreed to because I was making such a big deal about it).

So as we say our parting words, the service manager ends the conversation by saying, ""And hey, do me a favor will ya? Try not to sweat the small stuff."" which I thought was odd until I got into the car and the CD started playing. At this point it became immediately apparent that CD player must have also been on during the service manager's drive and he heard the audio-book I was listening to which happens to be called ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff"" - a guide on how to put challenges in perspective and reduce stress and anxiety over little things.

And there I was making a huge deal by escalating a minor car issue all the way to the manager of the whole service department and demanding a fix. SMH.

TLDR: Got caught listening to an audio book designed to help me not get worked up over small things, as I escalated a minor car service issue all the way up the chain to the manager.",TIFU by leaving a self-help CD in my car when bringing it in for service
300,tifu,"Obligatory this happened last....oh wait this happened today.

So to start off I play tennis very often and take it very serious, so much as I am around my coaches more than most other people around the tennis club. This is important because most of the coaches and I make lots of inside jokes (example: whenever I see one coach, I shake his hand and we both rub each others palms with our middle fingers and then proceed to burst out laughing every time)

Everything would have been fine if the new Asian girl wouldn't have been there. I had previously known her from a Snapchat group chat with many other tennis players from around my area, mainly her other tennis club with a few exceptions besides me. This is also important because many of the guys would post memes, some being ""danker"" than others so I thought I could crack my usual jokes like no tomorrow.

So here's the FU...

It was getting near the end of our group clinic, mostly younger kids, elementary-freshman in college, and the better players got pulled aside to do something different so the younger kids had more courts for some time. So the coach, who has a cold/possibly flu, says we are playing \*certain game\* and we are going to do random teams. I pipe up and say we should do rackets, where we all put our rackets in and somebody randomly picks them up two at a time with their eyes closed after shuffling them around for a second or two. Of course, my coach picks the other Asian kid, who is a freshman in college and I have made jokes around him and he is fine with it. But the other Asian girl, who was there for the first time, was standing right next to him. So he goes in to shuffle around the rackets, and I say, ""Well how are we gonna know if his eyes are closed or not?"" My coach instantly gives me a dirty look, as he likes to make a persons first time at the club perfect. Everyone else laughs and the Asian girl just stands there, a little confused as to what I just said and thought I said something to her.

My coach ended up throwing me out of the practice fifteen minutes later after I argued with him that one new person shouldn't have to make me change my jokes, especially when she knows that I crack jokes like this due to the group chat from before. There's a weekend break before I go back on Monday, so we'll see what my coach has to say then...

TL;DR said to the tennis group how are we gonna know if it's random if we can't tell if Asian kids eyes are closed, new Asian girl gets uncomfortable and I am asked to leave by coach",TIFU by making the new Asian girl at tennis practice think I was racist

This happed about 3 years ago, I was 19 at the time and not the brightest 19 year old there was. To set the scene it was a cold cloudy Monday afternoon around 2:00. I had nothing to do so I decided to take a shower like every other day but this day I was alone in the house so I could blast my music in the shower and have a concert in there! I was so excited, the water was steamy hot and felt so good on my skin that I broke out into my greatest shower singing voice! 

I was in the shower for about 30 minutes when I decided I need to get out and maybe do something productive with my life. When I stepped out I realized I had left my towel sitting on my bed. That was the first mistake to happen! As I stand there on the cold tile floor dripping wet I look down and notice a puddle by my feet that has accumulated. Thinking it would be funny for myself I kick that puddle. The first kick didn’t satisfy me enough so I kicked it again and that’s when  it happed....my left foot went straight up in the air, completely losing my footing so I start falling and my head lands on a corner of the bathroom where that corner sticks out from the wall. I open my eyes full of adrenaline wondering how stupid I was to have fallen like this. I stand up and feel a little light headed but think everything is okay. Well I start feeling something very warm dripping down my face. It couldn’t be the shower water so I wipe the side of my face to see that it’s blood. The top of my head starts to hurt and I find out that there is a 1 inch gash on the top of my head. I immediately think I’m dying as blood is pouring out of my head. I rush to put clothes and grab my phone to call 911 when I hear a voice outside my bedroom. It’s my sister. I open my door up with just jeans on and what she saw still haunts her till this day I think. There I am shirtless soaking wet with blood all over the top half of my body. I look like I had just gotten back from a war zone. She puts the towel that I was supposed to use to dry myself off before this to stop the bleeding on my head. After about 5 minutes we get it to stop thankfully and head to urgent care. 

Turns out once I got to urgent care I had fucked my self up more than I thought. I had to get 5 staples in my head, broke my right wrist and of all things broke a toe on my right foot. I’m pretty certain I had a concussion too.

This is were the fuck up happened.

We have recently started using liquid detergent like tide pods instead of in a bottle, so naturally thinking it was a dish washer tablet I put it in and turned it on. It started to smell like laundry, but I played no atraction due to the washing machine being on.

No one notes anything except our drinks and food starting to taste like detergent, but no one thought anything of this.

Only 3 days later when we went to Tesco's I pointed out the 'dish washer tablets' I was using and my mum  whent Pail. When we got home she made me sniff all the plate, glasses, cutlery and utensils  and wash them all again with real dishwasher tablets (after all my family members had a healthy does of detergent)

303,tifu,"I'm  a happily married male security guard, working third shift at a sleepy  little hospital. Technically, it's just a stand-alone Emergency Room, and if anybody needs further  treatment, they get sent to one of two or three ""real"" hospitals.

She's a nurse that just started working here, and I've just started getting  to know. She was telling me about her upcoming wedding today, and we  chatted for a little bit about her selling her old house, my marriage  jitters five years ago, and the like. It seemed very friendly, and I  could tell how excited she was for this wedding. She had kind things to  say about me and my story, but I took it as just friendly chatter instead of flirting.

I was sitting  at my desk, browsing reddit on one screen while the cameras are on the  other, and I saw movement in the triage room, which is odd because there  aren't any patients in the building. Nobody in the lobby either. It's  the nurse who's about to get married, who slips off her shoes. And  pants. And top. I could see she shaves her bikini area, and the lacy  bits on her bra, which is all she's wearing except socks. She steps onto  the scale, fiddles with her bra a little bit, and then steps back off  and gets dressed again.

Now my  heart is racing. I'm sick to my stomach; I can't believe what I just  saw. It feels gross to have intruded on something like that. What am I  supposed to do? I decide that what I'm not going to do is tell my  supervisor. I don't think there's a way for me to delete the video  footage, and I know that if my higher-ups know what to look for, they  can find it. I don't think they just browse everything randomly, though,  so if I don't draw attention to it, chances are good no one else will  see it. Right?

None of that was my  fault. What was my fault, is that I got her attention on her way out  the door and said something really stupid.

""Hey, good luck showing the house.""  
""Thanks!"" She smiled.  
""Hey,"" I hesitated. The anxiety started to choke me.  
""I don't know how to tell you this, but there are cameras in the triage room.""  


I  watched confusion make way to realization, followed by disgust. Utter  disgust. Anger, perhaps? I was still reeling and wondering how I  expected this news to be taken. I hadn't thought that far ahead.  


""I did not know that,"" she spat out, trying to look anywhere but at me.  


""I  won't tell anyone. Umm, good luck fitting in your wedding dress? See  you later."" I still don't know where in the everlasting hell that came  from. She left without saying anything more.

TL;DR ... I should have just suffered in silence with the knowledge of  what my co-worker's naked body looked like. The look of disgust on her  face is now burned in my face more than her nudity ever was.

I don't plan on telling anyone at work what I saw, but venting to reddit may help me get these emotions in check enough to sleep before my next shift. Tylenol PM will probably help, too.  


EDIT: I mentioned a lot of details about her state of undress, trying to get across the point that the [cameras had a pretty good shot](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA). I don't think I can pan or zoom, but I didn't have to. And she wasn't wearing any panties under her scrubs, hence the ""just bra and socks.""   


My only explanation for the ""Good luck fitting in your dress"" comment is that I was desperately trying to move the conversation forward in a positive direction. And that was the best explanation in my mind for her behavior, so it was the first thing my anxious brain caught hold of. It really wasn't supposed to be a fat joke because she is absolutely slim. Yes, I know I'm clueless. Hence why I'm in /r/TIFU.  


 I really didn't want to believe that she was flirting in our conversation, and that she would do it on purpose, but I left out the fact that our conversation directly before the incident started with me saying something along the lines of ""Hey, I played back the camera footage, and that creepy guest that didn't leave when the patient they were visiting left? Yeah, I made sure they left the building. They're gone."" Thirty minutes after that conversation, she is [standing directly under a camera and demonstrating that she's been going commando all night.](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA) The timing was slightly suspicious, but I didn't want to believe it.  


Although now a third option comes to mind. Being really slim and having a compulsion to weigh yourself at work... could that possibly indicate a former or current eating disorder? Now I'm even more of a jerk.

With my girlfriend on the phone trying to direct me to certain items she wanted without success I was getting visibly frustrated. Without everything she wanted I gave up and proceeded to the self checkout surely making a spectacle of myself as I continued our loud phone conversation.

I completed scanning all my items, or so I thought, and paid only to be suddenly comforted by a security guard. Had I forgotten to pay 5 cents again for a plastic bag? No, I had a reusable bag which I left in the basket. Why was security following me?

""I can put the cheese hidden in your bag back in the refrigerator, today will just be a warning,"" where the first words from the hovering security guard. In my rush I had put the reusable bag in my basket in such a way that I tossed a large fancy block of cheese in it without realizing. If the cheese was for me I probably would have given it back and walked out in shame over my mistake just thankful I was arrested for shoplifting or something. However, this cheese was for the girlfriend and I hadn't gotten all the items on her list as it was.

I insisted I wanted the cheese, so as he watched carefully I scanned in the single item to pay for it. Of course I added the item to the already purchased groceries setting of the repeated ""to many items in the bagging area"" in the robotic ladies voice.

With some assistance re-setting the self check-out kiosk I grab my wallet to pay and get this ordeal over with. I put the credit card in the slot and proceed to enter the pin incorrectly twice. Could I be this nervous, I just used it for the other shopping? Security takes the card from me and asks ""so you are Amy sir?""

My girlfriend and I have identical credit cards, except the name of course. Earlier that day I had used her card for an online purchase and I guess put it accidentally into my own wallet.

When I was 18 me and two friends went to St Thomas USVA. Friend A’s uncle had a condo there so it was a free stay! This was my first time flying and also friend A’s first time flying. We were nervous. Friend B told us he would give us something for the plane ride and we’d be chill. 

Right as the plane was boarding Friend B gave us (me and A) both what I guess what a very generous dose of Xanax or something similar, as well as taking some himself. A and I had never done Xanax type muscle relaxer stuff before either. After half an hour we were all solidly doped and could barely peel ourselves from our seats.

306,tifu,"I'm reading this over and sorry if this seems ranty and not much like a fuck up and more of a complain/venting but I'm tired and dont want to rewrite this.

I absolutely adore this girl and love her very much and I 100% know that she feels the same way about me. 

We were just texting and she shared a post with me and I had never really seen what she posts fo I was curious about it. I managed to cross deleted relationship posts from when we started dating until now, me being the dumbass shitty person I am looked at the deleted posts.  I was panicking it was a moment of weakness. I understand I did a really shitty thing and nothing in this post is an excuse. I fucked up bad and I am telling you what I feel and what I'll do to not fuck up again.

There was one post talking about it being a mistake to date me from around when we started dating and a more recent one talking about my mental headspace and her worry for me. The first one basically mentioned that she had just gotten out of a relationship and was planning to rejecting me but in a moment of weakness she caved and decided to date me because her ex was verbally abusive and didn't give her too much affection - basically I was a rebound. She says she deleted the post because she regretted it and doesnt feel that way anymore at all, so I basically hurt my own feeling on old confused feelings. The second one talked about my change in attitude in our relationship and recently being rather distant and not myself

I have issues with self confidence and am a nervous person in general, and affection is definitely something that is very new to my. Tbh I was very freaked out with it when the relationship started and was trying to get over the fear by just forcing things left right and centre to be more comfortable myself with it and now the change up of affection is concerning to her. I do want to be affectionate but its still a little scary and makes me nervous for me to do. These issues have been causing me to overthink everything in the relationship and be really distant towards her, treating her more as a friend sometimes. It's been putting a strain on the relationship, and due to university applications and diploma exams just around the corners its been really aweful lately and has been sorta spiraling for some time.

I have been trying to get better, talking to an online councillor and journaling, but with above mentioned stress and homelife stress among other things those have fallen by the wayside. I've also gained quite abit of weight and generally been neglecting taking care of myself. I know I need to get better but getting help is scary. I live a privilaged life with parents that provide more than enough. I work, I have security, a good future ahead of me. I have friends, a wonderful girlfriend and time to do what I want. I dont want to be greedy take up the time where it could be spent helping someone more deserving of it, however I do need to make this better.

The girl that I love is amazing and really does help I feel better around her and apreicate all she does. I feel like I dont do enough for her and am not qualified to be with her, which again I know is completely false but deep down theres a part of me that just likes to make things hard for me. She tells me, and shows affection, and fucking is in a relationship with me for christ sakes. She tells me im sweet, she says she enjoys spending time with me, she fucking loves me and what I do for her in all senses but I just cant shake this feeling that she should be with someone better, The posts discussed problems she had with me but for one reason or another didnt bring up with me. From what I read and in her texts I think she thinks its hopeless and wont change. Reading the posts and talking to her about it is a wake up call for me. I can't let such a wonderful person be in love with a crackshoot. We had a disscussion and talked about it and I do need to make her see that it will get better, not just say that it will

There are no classes for the next 2 weeks because of finals and diploma exams, as well as I will be in an empty house away from stressful family and have time to help and better myself. I've made meal and exercise plans for these 2 weeks as well as plans to recontinue talking to the online councillor and writing the journal. I'm giving myself a month and if things dont buck up I will talk to an inperson professional. I want to do this for myself as well as her.

TL;DR was shitty and read deleted posts from my girlfriend about it being a mistake to date me in the beginning relationship and hurting my already hurt brain.

307,tifu,"So to get things started I simply arrived at my friend's house. I have not seen him in a while because of college reasons. We were simply gaming and having some fun. Along comes his stepdad after a day in the city and  we decided to have something to eat. All things were going good, we were talk about this and that. Things were good. The stepdad proposed we do to a pub (a bar for all ye Americans out there) for a few drinks.

We had a few drinks, myself and the stepdad had a heart to heart in how we loved poetry, enjoying the works, and showing each others work. We spoke about my friend when he was away, either when smoking or  in a call, and we were bonding. He said that he was a truck driver (something I knew before and have all the admiration in the worlds for) and he spoke about some routes he took, and some friends he has lost, with some pictures. He even made poetry about some of the now deceased friends he had down his life which was so endearing that he would go to these lengths.

A few drinks later and we were going to leave. Then my friend spoke about his work and needing to stay up (his work is at nights), then the step dad spoke about he going to sleep normally because he should learn to wake up and work at any hours (or something to that degree). This in turn revved the passion behind the truck driving and spoke about his ire of companies such as the one my friend works in that causes truck drivers to work several hours, up to a cap whereby they they MUST stop and rest (a practice the stepdad did not agree with). He continued to talk at my friend about how that line of with is tough and a lot tougher than  what he is doing. I voice my opinion (after a good 10-15 minutes of the ""talking at"" happening) on how the conversation devolved from the friend should wake up in the morning and not the afternoon regardless of what time they finished work, to talking at him about truck driver.

Eventually I just stated ""I don't care about it"" and before I can voice why (reason: I cant comprehend what it must be like to simply do the line of work), he then looked at me like i was his worst enemy. The talk the banter, everything that happened in that night was erased by me simply saying five words. I left the pub and didn't look back after he then focused his anger on me for being ""just like the rest of the people who are too snobbish around truck drivers"". While I said what I said, the result was me desecrating the lives he knew and the struggle his son (my friend's step brother) must go through.

308,tifu,"DISCLAIMER: this misadventure happened last summer.

To give a little context to this whole story: a group of friends and I were travelling from Europe to NYC  for two weeks.  As a friend of ours was studying in Montreal we decided to take a short brake from the hussle of New York and stay for a few days in Canada. So we booked our night bus tickets  a few days before the departure (I didn't know at the time that Greyhound and co. kinda suck but it was the cheapest and most time saving transportation we could find).  Everything went wonderful in Montreal (the Canadians were very friendly and the Putine was incredible). The TIFU happened on the way back to NYC to catch our flight to Europe.

As many of you probably know, Canada just legalized the use of  recreational cannabis. I occationaly smoke pot, so I decided to take my grinder and vaporizer along the trip (which I put to good use in Montreal). We had a very tight time frame between our arrival in New York during the morning and our plane departure in the afternoon, so we had to be carefull not to miss our bus. As I already said, we were taking a night bus so my best friend and I decided to use my vaporizer one last time before hopping on our 10 hour long and hopefully stressfree drive back. Oh boy was I wrong. 

After smoking up our last weed, I put away my vaporizer as well as my grinder in my backpack, and not  in my luggage (which was stored in an extra locker under the bus). This is an important detail, so keep in mind. After putting my backpack in the overhead locker and settling down on my seat I thought I could relax for the next couple of hours or so, at least until we cross the border. At around 2 am we arrived at the US border and police agents asked all the passengers to leave their belongings in the bus and procced to Passport verification. After the checkup, I decided to quickly take a leak before continuing our travel. As I was walking out, one of the police agents shouts in the room: ""Whose backpack is this"", while holding MY bag in the air. My heart drops, while making him clear it's mine. 

He then procceded to ask me if I was travelling alone, to which I replied that I was not and waved at my frind to join me (my other friends already left one day earlier, so it was just us two idiots).  The agent then escorted us to the bus and kinda rudely asked us to pack all our belongings from the bus. At that moment i still wasn't sure what this was all about.  What did all this mean? Would we be stranded in the middle of knowhere while missing our flight back home? Would we be allowed back on the bus? All  these thoughts racing through my high ass mind. 

We then had to walk with all our luggage through the room were all the other passengers were wainting to a closed searching room. It realy felt like the Walk of shame from Game of Thrones ,where everyone was judging you by  their looks and wondering what bad thing I could have possibly done. A second agent then joined us for interrogation/body and luggage check. As I wasn't lucky enough the border agent who was assigned to me was very rude and agressive,  while my friend was casualy chatting with his police agent about NBA and other casual stuff. 

The police agent then shouted at me I should put my hands on the counter towards him, ""Just as a security precaution!"" and started to ask personal questions about my life etc. Finaly after half an hour of searching and interrogating he found my used but empty grinder and vaporizer and asked what this was all about. I explaned him as calmly as I could what it was and why I had it (cause of the legalisation in Canada). After a few minutes discussing with his partner he came back and said in his pseudo intimidating voice:"" Ok guys we have two good and a bad news. The good one, we wont have to put you in handcuffs and call the state police, but we will have to confiscate and DESTROY your toys. And the bus driver accepted to take you to NYC"". Man I was soo releaved. But I just couln't believe what had just happened.  Neadless to say I didn't sleep a bit that night. 

Fortnulately we only had an hour delay and didn't even have to rush to get our flight back home. I guess I won't do this mistake a second time in the future.

309,tifu,"On my phone obligatory

So I am a part of a robotics team at my high school and we go to competitions.

These tournaments/competitions last forever, and I mean FOREVER. Near the end of the competition I’m exhausted. I had drank a ton of water and needed to go to the bathroom. I walked into the bathroom and realized it was mirrored of the bathroom I went in earlier (I was going to the same BR). I see two girls from the only team at the competition from Mexico (I live in the US), who look up from their phones and stare right into my f*ing soul. I realize I’m in the wrong bathroom. Frantic, I yell “OH SHIT!” and run out faster than I ever have in my life. I had to stay at the competition for another hour and was so embarrassed trying to hide myself because I didn’t know what to do. Their team walked by like three times and apparently they looked at me. My teammates made fun of me the whole time too...

This happened a couple hours and I’m still contemplating killing myself lmao

So my parents had just gone out for the night and since I was home alone I did what any other normal guy would do and started slappin’ the salami. Halfway through for no apparent reason I got curious about how my dick looks to other people, so I got on Snapchat and took a bunch of pictures from every angle I could think of till I was satisfied lol. I thought I discarded the last picture I took so I carried on with my day... you can already see where this is going. 

About 10 minutes later my phone started BLOWING UP with messages from at least 20-30 people my mates included and even some people i haven’t spoke to in years, as soon as I opened one of their messages and realised what happened I swear I felt my stomach sink to the other side of the galaxy. I deleted it off my story straight away and thought that would be the end of it, just a few messages from mates questioning my mental state. 

But luckily for me that wasn’t the end of it, the girl that I’ve been talking to for the past few weeks and was supposed to take out for a date in a week apparently saw it aswell, because I sent her a message and saw that she had un-friended me. This completely crushed every bit of me because she’s the first girl I’ve spoken to that a felt a genuine connection with in a long time and just because of one stupid mistake now she’s gone :(  

I guess looking back on the whole situation now it’s pretty funny how fucking stupid I am, but I also wish I could go back in time to stop it from happening coz I ended up liking that girl a lot more than I thought I would . Whatever you win some you lose some 🤷🏼‍♂️ gg

Edit: Got her to add me back so I could explain what happened, she said it’s fine but I’m only getting really short dry responses now..oof

311,tifu,"This happened around 15 minutes ago, and I have to say, I do feel kinda dumb right now.

I just got out of school and my parents usually don't arrive until 5 or 6, so as always, I was waiting for them to come back. I was listening to some music when I decided to go get a drink. There were 2 boxes of Kool-aid Jammers in the fridge, one of which was open, but almost empty. Seeing as it was almost empty, I decided attempt to open the second one, which would lead to the creation of this post. 

On the Kool-aid box, it has that part of the box that tells you where to open it(idk if y'all know what I'm talking about, but Imma just continue). So anyways, when I tried to open it, In failed to open it, so what I did, being the genius I am, was grab the closest thing to me that I know could've got the job done, which was some scissors. So I go back to the box, and apparently I must've not considered the fact that scissors would also go through the pouches as well. So I went on to stab the area of the box that I failed to open it with a force that:

1) Got the box open.

2) Went through 4 of the pouches inside.

I opened the box fully and the next thing I know, the kitchen floor around me was covered in Watermelon Kool-aid. I was wearing socks too, so the feel of the Kool-aid was damp to me. Also, I was originally going to clean my room after getting a drink, but after that, I decided to clean up the kitchen first. That's all from me. 

TL;DR: I got thirsty and couldn't open a box of Kool-aid Jammers, resulting in me having to use scissors and created a huge mess while getting my socks wet in the proccess",TIFU by trying to open a box of kool-aid jammers with scissors
312,tifu,"Ok so this actually happed when I was like 7 or 8 but my dad just reminded me of it. One day me and my dad were watching TV in the living room. And something we always did when I was little was I would lay on top of my dad's stomach and we would have a blanket over us and sometimes we would fall asleep. 

One day I fell asleep and he fell asleep. I woke up and then for some reason when I woke up I decided to get up. Now I minus well describe the position we were in so basically my dad in his sleep drifted to the side and his upper torso was leaning to the side.and my head is resting over his left shoulder. 

I looked to my left and started to move my arm but it wouldn't move. I start making it go in circles it wouldn't move I start frantically shaking my arm. IT WOULDNT MOVE. At this point I'm practically crying thinking I lost my arm. Until I feel something on the back of my hand! Less then a second later I hear ow shit! I look to my left and see my hand which I'm still waving in the air. So basically what happend is I was moving the wrong arm and was flailing around my right arm in the air. But what's even funnier is that the arm I was look at wasn't even my arm it was my dad's arm on top I guess my arm slid under his or something. But how I got my skinny white ass arm with my dad big hairy tan arm I will never know. 

Oh yeah and dad was mad I hit him with the back knuckles of my hand pretty hard. TL:DR I was looking at my left arm thinking it was my right and moving mr right arm into my dad's face.",TIFU by giving my dad a nosebleed

As a valet between the hospitals in my local area I have entrances where I'm the only person on duty, but for a busier entrance there will be others working with me.

Before I forget, this incident took place when it was pretty cold outside - snowy cold. This is important.

At this one entrance, there was a group of us, and the cabinet where we keep the keys has a key to its lock hanging out of it...

At least it used to.

Lunchtime rolled around, and I take off to get a bite, only to return to find my colleagues in a frenzy. The key to the cabinet had disappeared!

Everyone's looking for the key: moving the cabinet, checking pockets, and so on, but there's still no sign of the key.

This is bad as this opens up an opportunity for theft!

Eventually one of the guys goes out and brings in his copy of the key, but the day passes and the original key.

Time goes by, and my boss has had the security guard check cameras for any sign of someone stealing the key, but security guard tells boss that he didn't see anything. Boss doesn't like security guard - apparently a condescending jerk - and must've chewed him out. Boss also goes around giving all of us our own copy of spare keys.

More time goes by, and it's still cold out but I've nearly forgotten about the key incident. Now I wear these big and heavy boots for snowy and cold weather, I call them my leg weights and my clompers, and one morning - at this same entrance - I just can't get one foot comfortable in one boot - big and heavy as they are they're actually pretty cozy. This boot... I'm checking inside it and fixing my sock, and it still feels wrong.

One last effort to make my boot feel right. I take out the inside liner and look in the boot...

... I was quite surprised to find a key in it! I take a closer look at it and think: Wait a minute, the teeth on this key look very familiar.

I put the key in the cabinet lock and it works!

What I think happened was at one point there was more than one of us at the cabinet and the key got jostled out of the lock and fell into the side of my boot where I did not feel it for WEEKS!

TL:DR Key went missing, turns out I walked off with it in my boot where it remained for weeks before I noticed something off with my footwear, and Boss gave a security guard an unfair earful because of my 'theft'.",TIFU By Committing Accidental Workplace Theft

End of the work day I was the last of my depart and so had the responsibility to make sure all the lights were off and doors locked in the warehouse, once I had locked up I made my way to my car. Now the front door to the building is one of those gates that gets locked when it’s closed and is opened with the push a button on a remote which only the front desk guys (who have all left by this time (there is one on the wall for the end of the day when everyone leaves)), then there’s a person size gap and then a glass door to the reception, this is important for later. 

So I am in my car, getting podcasts ready for the journey home, I glance over to the passengers seat and see the warehouse keys sitting there ,”Shit, I must have forgot to put the keys on the hook when I left” I thought to myself “No biggie I’ll just reach through the gate open the door and toss them on the desk”. So I get out my car reach through, toss the keys in and close the door.

Then I look in my left hand.

And there are sitting in the palm of my hand are the warehouse keys mocking me for my stupidity.

If you haven’t guessed, what I had just done was toss my car keys into the reception which I have no way of getting into.

I had never felt such willingness to want to drop down dead.

Luckily I noticed a colleges car still in the parking lot and gave them a call and asked to let me back in and after laughing at my stupidity helped me search for my car keys which we eventually found and I could go on my humiliated way.

315,tifu,"This happened start of November. Aka Failure day. I get to the airport in Ha Noi, Vietnam. I get off at arrivals (because I can't read Vietnamese)... Thought it was weird only I disembarked, and then realised my fail. When I get to departures, I've still got two hours. I go to check in, and give them my bag. They ask for my exit ticket from Indonesia, and I explain that I was going to buy a ticket there once I've decided where to go from there.  She reminds me of the visa ruling stating the need for a departure ticket. 

This should simply be fixed with a quick bit of smartphone shopping. Except my bank is infuriating with online payments always requiring a confirmation text message, and my number has changed with each country I've traveled to. After constantly failing to get the tickets, I call a friend in Australia who buys them with few minutes to spare before check in shuts. Soon as she sees my purchase, I have my tickets and get to the first screening. But I'm told to go back to luggage checks. My anxiety for timing and flights is really gripping me now. 

Security officer inside this small room asks which bag is mine, and I point it out. He shows the scan of the bag and points out 12 bullet shells highlighted on his screen and I realise my big fuck up. Whilst in Cambodia, I found a load of empty 9mm shells in a dried out lake, and for some reason bagged them thinking I'd make some shitty bracelet or something stupid. I'd forgotten them completely. So I plow through my bag and find the little plastic bag I'd put them in. The plastic bag had split, 9 shells still inside, which I hand over. 3 left to go. 

He picks up the tray and scans the bag again, pointing them out on the screen. He picks my bag out of the tray and hands it back to me. I'm now throwing socks and shorts everywhere till I've found 2 more in the creases. But fuck, I just can't find the last shell, I'm searching inside socks and pockets, but nothing! He grabs the bag back from me and throws it through the scanner without the tray, only this time it comes back clear, no shells! I feel a sigh of relief and say cool, we must've miscounted. But he's adement there was still one more and starts accusing me of pocketing it. I'm sweating bricks and pleading I'm not that stupid, whilst he gets angrier and louder, I'm looking around everywhere, scared and confused af. When finally I see it sat in the tray he had scanned the bag in before, well out of reach. I point it out and he sort of chuckles and lets me go.

I ran to security screening with my carry-on bag, I  take off all my metal stuff... And then get stopped because I left a cockscrew in my carry-on bag. Ffs

316,tifu,"Some context. My boyfriend is not a degenerate, but he was a fucking cringey preteen. This happened about a week ago while sleeping over at my boyfriends (M18) house. His family has a pretty shitty house in a rough neighborhood, so obvs it's not going to be big enough for a large family like his. He has to share a room with his brother in a bunkbed, bf being on the top. Luckily his brother was out at the time so we got the room all the ourselves.

Skip a few hours and we are just cuddling in his bed.I have this weird quirk that while cuddling, my face has to be in smushed between the mattress and the wall (or in this case the little wooden railings to keep the occupant from yeeting themselves off in the middle of the night) if I wanna fall asleep. 

We continue cuddling for a while longer before he starts acting a bit weird. Like. ""I know something you dont"" kinda weird. I ask him whats up and he continues avoiding the question. Being an annoying shit, I bug him until he tells me what's been on his mind. 

He admittedly tells me that he would prefer if I *didnt* sleep with my face so close to the railings. 

Ok. Odd request because I sleep like this all the time at my dorm room. I press him a bit further.

My bf confesses that as a horny 13 year old, he jerked it alot. We all went through that phase so I thought I could prepare myself for what cringe he was about to bless me with.

I was wrong. 

Apparently when he ""finished"", my boyfriend would dispose of the mess by just smearing it on his bunkbed railings. However, this wasnt just a one time incident. He eventually started to purposely aim his cum at the bed so he could build up a wall of his own cum to admire. 

I take a closer look and to my absolute horror there is 6 year old dried cum dripping from the sides of his bed. It looked like sap droplets from maple trees, threathing to spill onto the unfortunate occupant bellow. It wascaked on thick enough that there is a noticable color variation from the wood that's been jizzed on, and the normal fucking bed frame he hasnt tainted. 

Oh but that's not the worst. Oh no. The worst is that realization that I have been pressing my face into my boyfriend's crusty man seed. His cum, aged like a fine wine for 6 fucking years, has been encasing me for the entire duration of our stay together in that goddamn bunkbed.

Fucking horny preteens man. Absolutely disgusting.

317,tifu,"A little context: I work in the conformal coating department at my job. We basically spray silicone snot onto circuit boards and it stains and tends to get everywhere.


So this started when I was having a conversation between me, my supervisor and two coworkers. I'm well acquainted with my sv and one coworker but not so much the other. The one I'm unfamiliar with is in charge of all of the needs of the employees material needs. (Work smocks, tools, etc). I asked her at one point if she could put me down for needing another smock as it looks like I've been wiping my nose with the sleeves, it looks gross and wont come out. That or jazzing on my elbows ""Yeah sure but you're gonna have to wait like three months"". Recently the coworker that I'm more familiar with recieved a new smock IN BLACK. (We have a variety of colors). She then asked her why she chose a black smock instead of a white one because stains dont show up as easy on white. This is when I jokingly ""Ah yes. The same reason that I wear tightywhites"". This was followed with a facial expression of that resembling smelling the farts of someone who  ate a $2 gas station burrito a a half hour ago. She then walks away my SV following closely behind and he calls me disturbing. Meanwhile my other coworker is laughing hysterically. 

Tl:DR I made a self deprecating joke a about yeehawing my tightywhites, and I dont know whether to be ashamed or amused with my own wit.

318,tifu,"Well, this didn't actually happen today, but a few weeks ago right before Christmas. 

My wife and I have been married for 15 years, and we live with my 19 year old step-daughter and our two boys, age 14 and 10. We often work alternating schedules (me day shift, she works 12 hours shift, usually 7pm to 7am) so we hardly get any time to spend with each other. She took off the week before Christmas because her parents were coming into town to spend the holidays with us. They were going to take my step-daughter's room and she was going to use the spare, as her bed is bigger than the twin in the spare room. They came early in the morning on the Friday before Christmas and this takes place on that day. 

I got off work a little early that day, and the kids were all home so it was a packed house most of the day. My wife took my in-laws and the 19 year old out for some shopping/lunch and left the boys at home because Fortnite was more fun than hanging with Grandpa, but whatever. I got home about 30 minutes after they left. My wife texted me ""Be careful when you into the bedroom, I may have left one of your gifts out..."" with some emojis that could have been taken as suggestive. This is where the FU begins.

I go into the bedroom and see some wrapping paper and stuff out and just kind of not look at much as I am actively not looking for a present, I just want to change out of work clothes and use the bathroom. I get to the bathroom, and I see what my wife must have meant by ""present"" and all those winky emojis: her vibrator, left in the shower. Since we don't spend too much time together, she would occasionally send me naughty pics or tell me that she used her vibrator, just to make me want it more. I would reciprocate and it made things fun. She has left it out before, so it wasn't shocking that she did, I just didn't think she would with her parents in town and the kids off of school. Well, I didn't think that at the time, because I wasn't thinking rationally. I locked the door, turned on some light music in the room (not unusual for us, we have Google Home in each room with Spotify, someone is usually listening to something) and decided to be a little perverted.

I took the vibrator and turned it on, I wanted to feel what made my wife get off. To answer everyone's question: yes, it was used very recently, as it was still very wet and not from the shower. My wife does get very wet, very easily. She says it's normal in her family. So, I did what any sex deprived horny husband would do after finding his wife's wet vibrator: I licked that fucker clean. I let it vibe in my mouth, I put it against my non-vibrating member and really just had a great few minutes. I finished very well, so well it shot out like a damn protein cannon, going god-knows where in the bathroom. But, that's not the FU.

After I was done with my shameful deed, I decided to clean it up (always take care of your toys) and put it back. After I dried it off, I texted my wife ""I found your gift"" with a heart eyes emoji. Her reply wasn't one that was happy, but rather said that she wished I didn't, now she'll have to get me something else. Well, at the time all I could think was ""YES PLEASE"" but I didn't respond right away. I took the vibrator out of the bathroom, made sure the coast was clear and proceeded to the drawer were my wife puts it. I open the drawer, move the shirt out of the way that it's usually wrapped in to see...

My wife's vibrator.

The one in my hand did not belong to her.

It either belonged to my step-daughter, or my mother-in-law. I freaked the fuck out. I ran back to the shower and put it back first off, then I went through the house, trying to find out what just happened. I found my in-laws bags in my step-daughter's room still unpacked. They still were locked with the little travel locks that some people use on airplanes. So, I sighed with relief, knowing that it wasn't my MIL's. 

But then, I got equally horrified that it was my step-daughters. Why the hell was she in our bathroom? Well, the in-laws took over her bedroom, and the spare room has the Xbox in it so the boys were playing games on that one and in the living room. I can only imagine that someone was in the hall bathroom so that makes the only private area in the house left was in my and my wife's bedroom/bathroom. She has used the bathroom before to shower or what have you when the boys are using the hallway one. She must have forgotten to put it away. Dear God why did she forget to put it away? I am ashamed to know that not only was my wife right about her family wetness, that she has the same taste in toys as her daughter.

They got home about an hour afterwards, or was it five minutes? Who the fuck knew at that point, time was meaningless as I was in a stupor of shame and guilt. My wife asked me if I was alright when she saw me, she could see I was visibly shaken. I told her that the vibrator was left out, but I couldn't bring myself to say what I did with it. She saw it, laughed and told my daughter that she ruined me by leaving it out. She patted me on the back and said ""well, I guess I'm not a little girl anymore"" and giggled as she went to put it away. Thank God they also share a good sense of humor. But they don't have to live with this shame. It's better they don't know at this point, right? Saying a month later ""Hey honey, your daughter's vibrator tastes just like yours"" would just be too much to deal with..

After trying to go back to sleep for about 30 minutes, I thought what the hell I might as well rough up the suspect this morning. I go to our bathroom, look at all her lotion options in her basket,grabbed one that says:  ultra moisturizing, shea butter, and thought this is my safest bet and go back to bed and click on the ole pornhub bookmark and watch CoyWilder, not realizing  my fuckup, finished the drill yada yada. I get up get ready for work, noticing a little discomfort and burning on my scrotum, however I powered through the work day. I get home and tell my girlfriend, whose a nurse, about my discomfort throughout the day and the last intercourse was my man to hand relationship. She told me go get the bottle I used. I go get the bottle... as I pick it up I realize my fuckup. I masturbated with body wash, rubbing my shaft raw, blistering it. Girlfriend makes fun of me as I throw her bottle in the trash, and make a vow to never masterbate again. Moral of the story fellas, if your gonna beat your willy, don’t use the body wash or anything silly. 

TL;DR: mistake girlfriends body wash for lotion on the bathroom counter, masterbated with it causing my dick to blister  and burn at work all day.",TIFU by master-bating with my girlfriends “lotion”
321,tifu,"Obligatory: this wasn’t today, but it was just last night. 

My (F) FWB (M) and I were hanging out, planning on a fun night. We had a few drinks and a few laughs, then it came time for the real fun.

Context: we’re both into kinky type things. Sex toys, role playing, etc. We decided to try a butt plug for the first time because we both wanted to know what it felt like to have sex while I had one in. 

So we get down to it. This thing is a pretty good size, made of silicone. We lube it up, get it in, spend a little time admiring the cute gem on the outside, then get down to business. We’re laughing, moaning, really getting down and dirty, and it was fantastic! When it came down to the finish line, I was on my back, so he couldn’t really see the plug anymore. You know where this is headed. 

We finish up and catch our breath for a few minutes, then start to move to clean up, get a drink, etc. I reach around to remove the plug. My fingers get between my cheeks, and... nothing but starfish. No plug. We started looking around, thinking it had come out. It’s not in the bed, it’s not on the floor, nowhere to be found. My stomach sinks. 

So apparently there aren’t a lot of nerve endings farther up in your colon. I’m sitting there with wide eyes, clenching my ass and trying to feel it, but I can’t feel a thing. At this point, we’re both laughing from a mixture of humor and sheer terror. I stuck a finger up there and lo and behold, there it was! It was only a couple of inches in, but my fingers are short and the angle was weird and I couldn’t grasp it. 

At this point I’m panicking. I work in the medical field, I’ve seen this happen. The ass is a vacuum. It sucks things upward and the harder you push to try to get it out, the farther up it goes. I’m trying to relax, but my mind is already racing, preparing myself for a horribly mortifying emergency room visit, at the hospital I work at no less. 

Quick thinking and level headed as always, FWB says, “let me try”. I’m panicking and mortified, but thank god I had the alcohol buzz going on. It helped tremendously in this situation. I rolled over onto my stomach, did my best to relax my muscles, and I let him get to work.

This guy and I have been friends for years, but NEVER have we gotten this close. He was knuckles deep with two fingers in my ass, digging and probing and swirling. After an excruciatingly long minute, he yells, “GOT IT!” and pulls the plug out. I have never been so mortified and relieved at the same time. 

We laid there for a good minute or so, breathing hard and laughing, well, I was laughing and crying at the same time! We eventually got up, washed our hands, and immediately went downstairs for another drink. I think we both needed it. 

It’s a rough situation to be in, ZERO STARS! DO NOT RECOMMEND! However, I think it has made our friendship stronger. He was a true gem in this situation! I now know that if I ever need somebody to dig around in my ass and pull something out, he’s my guy! 

TL;DR: TIFU by having sex with a butt plug in. That thing got sucked alllll the way up in there. FWB had to dig it out for me. He got it, and it saved us a trip to the ER! I think he’s earned best friend status! We will not be doing this again, lesson learned! 😂",TIFU by doing butt stuff...

So I'm visiting my boyfriend while he works out of town. He's staying in this little picturesque town. My brilliant mind thought it might be fun to see some of the views while he was at work. 

The first issue is that it's winter up north where we are. Now I'm more then used to driving in the snow and my Jeep has 4WD so of course in my mind I'm invincisible (LOL). 

Now my second fuck up of the day came when I decided to trust Google Maps to get me to the nearest State Park. Of course it conveniently took me to some back road to cut across PRIVTE PROPERTY to get me there. 

 Now I know you're thinking right now ""you dumb bitch just turn around now no damage done.""  Alas my fuck ups don't end there. No I flip the 4WD on and try it thinking it can't be that bad... Spoiler it is...

Finally my common sense kicks in (Where was that bitch 20 min ago?) about the time I can't see the road anymore. I try to salvage and turn around and of course my Jeep decides this is now its forever home.


Currently waiting for the tow truck hoping he gets here in time to save my ass. So I can then beat my boyfriend back to the cabin &amp; not have to hear about my brilliance today for the next 10 yrs.

We had people coming and going since we were the only relatives living in Arkansas.Things were so crazy until eventually most relatives went away until Aunt Patricia and her family was left.Now I hate her more than anything but thank god she takes naps in the evening. 

 Now I felt horny as fuck(you can’t jerk off in a house filled with people) I watched porn in the living room when nobody was around. I was wearing headphones and couldn’t hear anything. Now I had a boner and I saw the porn actress in cowgirl first then anal. I heard a voice behind me 

“Hey what are those funny holes? ” I looked behind me and froze solid. It was aunt Patricia’s son watching from behind .”I have that thing on me too” he said pointing to the pornstar’s penis. “Oh and mom also has those hanging bags” he said happily pointing at the pornstars tits.He saw the pornstars kissing and said”You’re not supposed to watch that” aunt Patricia always told him that kissing was wrong.i ran away in an instant. I’m not sure what I’m gonna do now, I just pray that that little bitch won’t snitch on me.

324,tifu,"This happened around Christmas time.


As it goes, my wife and I have been together for 12 years. My wife is from a super conservative Christian household. 

Currently at our home we are having our bathroom renovated. It’s going to take about a week and in the mean time we asked my wife’s parents if we would be able to come over to their house to shower. So just like the day before we packed up and headed over to the in-laws to take a shower, when we arrived at their place there was construction happening that was blocking their drive way so we had to park about 100 ft up and walk up their drive way. When we opened the door nobody else was home, my father in law was at work and my mother in law was just out. 

Since nobody else was home we decided to just quickly shower together, sounds weird but even after being married for 12 years her parents like to think of their daughter as somebody whom I have never touched before lol. So we hop in the shower and as usual I start soaking up my wife’s ass n titties, she still does it for me after all these years. Rubbing up against her etc. I asked my wife to quickly let me bang one out. She said she would but her stomach was hurting so she asked if she could just suck me off, which I was happy to agree.

So there’s my wife on her knees blowing me like a champ. I guess between the noise of the shower, her gagging on my cock and maybe the construction outside we didn’t hear my mother in law get home. And she didn’t know we where there as the car was parked farther down the street!

So my wife’s sucking me off like a pro, in inching closer about to bust a huge fat nut all over her pretty face when all of a sudden the shower curtain swings open and there is my mother in law standing naked!!! My wife released my cock from her hand and mouth and instantly curls up on the shower floor. But my orgasm has already started! In the chaos of things I kind of turn to the side and now my pulsing throbbing cock is facing her and if spews out two thick sticky ropes of cum and splash on to my mother in laws belly! My wife looks at me in shock and yells “YOU EJECULATED ON MY MOTHER!”. My mother in law standing there in shock, me in shock still quivering from pleasuring and my wife gets up quickly and ushers my mother in law out of the room. 

All I know is that my mother in law thought it was my father in law in the shower and she was coming in to join him when she got a hot sticky surprise.

That night I slept on the couch as my wife was still pissed off I came on her mom, even though it was technically not my fault. I’m not sure what my wife and mother in law spoke of it, because it has never been brought up. I’m sure my super conservative father in law doesn’t know or he would have said something to me for sure because I put my white seed all over his wife’s belly. But it’s been a month and my wife brings it up less and less so I guess we are passed it.

 So this whole shit Show begins when my best friend invites me for drinks and to chill out at her house. I say: okay, why the hell not, even though  I had been crying the whole day just because of dysphoria.(anyone not aware dysphoria basically means hate torwards your body) Things go fine at first, as they always do, but then I get just this massive urge to do something bad to my body because of dysphoria. So I start drinking, and drinking and drinking. Eventually i find myself in her bathroom puking. I think I fell asleep in there too. After some time passess, my friend starts to get worried. She basically forces the door open and runs to my side. I think I puked for about an hour until my friend calls me an ambulance. Drinking is not safe for me not only because im underage but im also extremely underweight. This is the part where my memory gets quite cloudy. They took me into the ambulance, and took me to the hospital with my friend also onboard. I was cracking jokes at this point with the paramedic. So eventually he asks for my Social security number and my name. I haven't changed my name legally yet,(I'm trans btw) so I just had to say my deadname. He mocked me for not saying I was trans and that violet ""wasn't my real name"". Holy shit that felt bad... So we arrive at the hospital and I say to the laughing hospital staff something along the Lines of ""if nothing else I'm quite good entertainment for you guys"". Then they asked me exactly what we had been drinking. I think I said liquor, liquor and more liquor. (Very traditional to drink a shit ton in finland on the weekends) Then the doctor said that they will have to report this to the authorities who decided I was to be contacted by a Social worker soon because I'm underage. (I don't know the name for them in english) After a while I start to drift asleep. I remember waking up to Someone literally screaming in pain right next to me. The next thing I remember was waking up about an hour ago and grabbing my phone just to see my friends voice messagess in which she said that the hospital  staff kicked her out and she had been freezing outside for and hour, her dad nor my mom could could come pick her up and she couldn't just walk since we live 20 km away from the hospital.
I have no idea where the hell she is right now...
Currently I'm sitting on a hospital bed shaking so fucking much waiting to hear from my friend and for my mom to come pick me up. 

Tl;dr: I drank so much that I had to get picked up by an ambulance and rushed to the hospital just to wake up to the even more bad news.

326,tifu,"When I was younger, I used to be absent minded, was a nightmare for not paying attention to what I was doing, and as a result breaking things. I feel like I’ve learnt to think about what I’m doing. 

A few months ago I left my hometown to move to where my girlfriend (who has a gas hob and kettle, this is relevant.) lives, occasionally, but not frequently enough, I come back to see friends and family. My sister also recently bought her own house, with a gas hob. 

So this weekend I came home to meet up with friends, last night I went into town, this afternoon I came to visit my sister and her boyfriend. The visit is drawing to a close and I said “can I have another coffee then? I’ll have a coffee and fuck off”. Took the electric kettle off the base, topped it up with water, placed it on the gas burner, and lit the stove.... took a minute or so for her bf to be like “Wolfman, that’s an electric kettle....”

So I’d been at my new job at the time for around 4 weeks and we had a toilet in the back of the workshop, you open the door and the toilet is straight ahead. 

So I am standing up peeing and happen to have been picking my nose at the same time. Two birds one stone kinda situation.  Yeah I’m holding my dick in one hand and the other has a finger in my nose. 

The area manager opens the door that I forgot to lock &amp; in a brief moment of panic, I turn around whilst startled to look whose there. Now rather than my reflexes taking my finger out of my nose, I automatically put my dick away full stream and face him with my finger still firmly in my nose.. 

It was a confusing split second realisation as I felt my shorts get wet before I took the finger out and he shut the door.

328,tifu,"Obligatory “it didn’t happen today, happened over the last few weeks.” 

TL;DR at bottom

So, a few weeks ago, I saw an interview on ESPN about Kevin Love’s diet. And he mentioned that he tried to drink his weight in fluid ounces / day of water. I play basketball with my university and immediately thought “wow! What a fantastic idea! I should try that!” So I invested in a 52 oz water bottle and tried to drink it 4x daily. 

What followed was the worst month of my life so far as GI issues.

I felt like shit all the time. I lost a ton of weight because my appetite was totally gone. I had awful cramps almost nightly. I’d spend several hours on the toilet every day either peeing or trying to shit out my cramps. I couldn’t drink any alcohol without throwing up, so going out with friends was totally out of the question. Practice became unbearable. I’d sweat bullets anytime I was slightly warm (really grossing out my teammates). I couldn’t sleep well because i always woke up in pools of sweat. I always felt full, my eyes felt like they were about to pop out of my head. Shit was awful. 

I had heard of water intoxication, but I assumed that took like, gallons a day. So, I kept up my routine for the entire month. 

Finally I go to the doctor. I explain what’s going on and my doc immediately starts ordering all kinds of tests. Bloodwork, X-ray, colonoscopy, all of it. Very worried about some kind of stomach cancer, Crohn’s, ulcers—you name it. I’m freaking out at this point, calling my mom, thinking about taking a semester off college, you name it. 

Doc notices my water bottle and makes a joke about how big it is to try to cheer me up. I laugh and proudly tell him I drink it 4 times a day. He laughs at first, then looks at me:

“Wait are you serious?”

“Yup.”

“For how long?”

“Ohhh a few weeks.”

“When was the last time you drank Gatorade or ate something salty?”

“Oh I don’t know. A while I guess.”

Doctor looks at me and just bursts out laughing.

“Fireblade09 you flushed out your sodium dumbass. Go drink some Gatorade and eat some salty popcorn.”

So a 6 pack of Gatorade and a few days of only a few glasses of water a day, I’m back to new. 

TL;DR: had the bright idea to drink a grotesque amount of water daily. Flushed all the sodium out of my system and had a miserable month of GI issues.",TIFU by flushing my kidneys
329,tifu,"Happened last night. Still in a bit of shock over it. Sorry if this is long. Writing this was a bit therapeutic for me so I included lots of contributing points to the story.  Throw away account.

When to start...OMG. You need some background to understand the depth of my F up.

I'm separated from my husband. When we had finally just broken up (took us a long time to finally make the decision) I went on a work trip to China for a conference. I met a guy there who was from a city close to mine back in Canada. We're the only two non-asian speaking Canadians at this international conference, so we become friends (limited options on who to talk to)..Call him John. He is 15 years older than me and works in the same industry. He is a VP in a prestigious company and is well known in our industry. He was also attending the same conference. We both got really drunk and I ended up in his hotel room (he is married, but relationship is ending, I know not an excuse, but he was coming on to me and he said he had cheated before. I was sad and felt nice to be appreciated after being in a bad relationship). Nothing really happened between us, but it was clear that we both wanted something to happen. I was newly separated and wasn't ready to have relations with another person. We communicate through linkedin because he doesn't want to get caught.

Fast forward a month, he is visiting my city. We meet up and have sex. It was amazing. But me, having only ever been in long term relationships and just ended an approx 15 year relationship, mistakenly thought that maybe a relationship was going to come out of this fling. I was all of a sudden very infatuated with this guy, but to him it was obviously just a casual thing that happened. I was totally into him, but he wasn't into having a relationship. We lived in different cities and it was hard for me to find a reason to txt him, even though I wanted to all the time. So pretty much we had sex that then he was totally cold towards me, kind of a dick. I have a meeting near his office, so I plan to go in to visit other work friends in his office while I'm there. I 'run into him.' He tells me he has officially separated from his wife. Now I start regular texting him (very rarely). English is not his first language so sometimes he wording is wrong and he almost never txts me. I also think he is 15 yrs older and maybe not as proficient a txter.

There were 3 or 4 future events where our work schedules overlapped or we were in each others city and we would get together, i.e. have sex. Always in a hotel room. Always kind of secretive because we knew each others work colleagues. It was super hot, and this guy is amazing in bed. But always the same thing, he wouldn't give me much notice or would send very few messages. Then after we met cold shoulder.

This went on over about the course of a year. I realized after probably the second/third time that I shouldn't waste my time sitting around waiting for him. I got into online dating and learned about what casual dating is, and how adults tend to date in their 30s now. So I was less hooked on him, but still kept him in the back of my mind because he is so hot and so good in bed. I realized he wasn't good for me and there was no future there, but we saw each other a few more times.

I was going to attend a big conference in another city (John's hometown). Any big event like that I always wonder if he will be attending. Sometimes I will know about an event weeks or months in advance and I always start wondering/hoping if he will be there. I also wonder if I should txt him to ask, but I don't want to look too eager, and he rarely responds and is kind of a dick to me. Anyway, my company happened to be organizing this conference and I was asked to go through the list of attendees. Of course I look for his name...and it's there. I'm far more excited than I should be. I've known about the conference for about 3 months, I see his name like 2 weeks before. I decide to not text him, I'm strong (but really very weak I'm thinking about him a lot). See him at the conference and bump into him, we have to be very non nonchalant about our relationship in the work environment. I say to him 'want to hang out later,' which means 'do you want to have sex later.' He's in. We both have separate networking dinners then plan to meet later. He sends me a linkedin message about meeting out at a bar later. I txt him back trying to find out where he is. He says he's 'at Munich having beers, I should join him.' I looked up this I place and it's hard to find, but I find it but think it's too far to walk there now. I'll just wait until he is back. He doesn't txt me back so I eventually LinkedIn message him. He responds and we meet up. It's great.

The next day we spent some time together just chatting. Then he asks me if I want to have lunch with him, so we do. Which was crazy in front of my colleagues, but we pretended like it was just a work relationship. It may look weird to some onlookers because he is 15 years older than me. After lunch I had two separate colleagues ask me about eating lunch with John and I just said we were friends back from when we were at a conference together in China. I'm kind of proud to be seen with him and it feels like a real date compared to other stuff we've done.

This story is getting too long. 3 months later I'm at a meeting in his city. I book the tickets a month in advance and I think all along if I will get to see him. I even booked a hotel that wasn't the one my colleagues were staying at in anticipation that I might get to have sex with him, so we don't have to be so secretive. I'm on the fence about txting him. I'm kind of dating someone else now but think it might not be working out. Should I end this relationship so that I can see John? But I don't even know if John would see me. So I wait it out. In my mind I come to the conclusion that if I'm thinking about him so much I want to txt him, so I'm going to do it. On Tuesday this week I txt him and say 'hey I'm going to be in your city Wed/Thurs' night let me know if you are free and want to get together.' I play it cool and appear like it's no big deal to me. He responds and he is free and wants to see me. I'm instantly far more excited than I should be. I can't wait. I pack a date outfit and my sex things so that we will have a great time. I get my body all prepped for a date night (shave legs, makeup, etc.). So we make plans to meet after my work dinner at 9 pm. He is even txting me suggesting we go to a nice restaurant/bar (like a real date) . He lives in the suburbs so he has to go home first. Because I want to have fun with him I suggest he can sleep over in my hotel room (I'm thinking we are going to have sex anyway), that way he doesn't have such a long drive in the morning. Hotel is downtown and parking is tough, I tell him he can leave his car at my hotel over night. I say that I was expecting he was going to come to my room at some point (being pretty direct about wanting to have sex). He seems a little reluctant, but I push it a bit more. He seems to agree. I wait in the lobby for him because he needs a hotel key to get into the garage.

I see someone walk in and it's not John. He comes right up to me and says ""hey Sarah"". I know this person, but not that well. I'm bad with names on the spot.

Me:Hi what are you doing here?

John: I'm meeting you.

Me: What do you mean?

John: we're meeting at 9 and he shows me his phone.

I'm confused.

Me: ?

John: It's John, we're meeting at 9.

We hold our phones beside eachother and I see the identical chat conversation with John.

Me: (wide eyed, jaw open) What? OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I was texting the wrong John I know 2 Johns in the same city).

Super embarrassing moment where we are just staring at eachother deer in headlights. I'm still so confused, at what point did I accidentally text him. Is John (the right one) still showing up?

We get it all cleared up and I say to him, 'hey let's still go out for a drink'. So we do, but holy fuck that was awkward. He thought I wanted to have sex with him and I didn't. I feel terrible and I look slutty. He directly knows I was trying to have sex with someone that night. He also didn't know I had separated from my husband (I cleared that up), so when we were txting he thought I was even sluttier.

The worst part to me, was that I got so excited about seeing John (1). I was thinking about him all day, dreaming about all the sex things we were going to do. I was so turned on and happy he had been txting me. Then I was crushed because I wasn't going to have amazing sex and John (1) hadn't actually been giving me more attention. I was so sad.

In writing this story, I've determined when the real fuck ups happened over many months:

1. I think I deleted John (1) out of my phone after realizing he is shitty to me. But I have a busy life. I forgot this. (this was a win for me though, I was being strong). Or maybe I just combined the contacts inadvertently at some point?
2. I never should have become involved with someone who was married at the time.
3. At the big conference in his city, when he LinkedIn messaged me and I txted back. I searched for John in my phone and it came up with the correct area code (different from mine), so I txted that number. This was John (2) who actually was in Munich having beers. I must have added John (1)'s last name to John (2)'s contact at that point. I know John(2) as a friend from a yearly work event that I attend and get very drunk at. We were probably coordinating for dinner or drinks one year so I got his number but didn't know his last name).
4. I mistook weird points of information in our texts as poor language translations and sloppy texting, but now they make sense. There were details that didn't add up.
5. So turns out the entire conversation I thought I was having with John (1) is actually John (2), and John (1) has no idea I'm even in his city. I deep search through my phone and find John (1)s number and text him to tell him about this crazy mix up (that he knows nothing about).
6. John (2) now thinks I'm a skank.
7. The real fuck up took place over a year and a half, when I cared too much for someone who didn't care for me and treated me like shit. I realize this part of the story now. I even left some bad things he did to me out. Why am I still attracted to this person? Terrible. I think I need to take a break from dating.

TL;DR: I fell too hard for a guy that just wanted to have casual sex with me. We lived in different cities and had different first languages. We saw each other occasionally. I must have realized he (John) is bad for me and I delete him from my phone. We are at a conference together, I look John up in my phone and txt him (correct first name and area code, no last name). I update his contact info to include last name. I'm at another work event visiting his city and decide to txt him. We text far more than normal, some odd things I don't get but assume its due to language barrier. I'm just exctied by how interested he is in me. Turns out I had another John (work acquaintance) from the same city in my phone. I mistakenly text this guy (John(2)) to come meet me and say he can stay over in my hotel (i.e. have sex). John (2) shows up at my hotel. I am completely dumbfounded and confused. I'm so embarrassed. I have to tell him I'm not interested..but now he knows I'm skanky. We still go out for a drink. I'm disappointed because I don't get to have sex and turns out this guy I like still hasn't shown any real interest in me. Biggest mistake was caring too much for a guy who is shitty to me.

TL:DR: Shorter version: Mixed up phone numbers in my phone.  Started txting a guy for a casual sex meet up in my hotel.  Turns out I txted the wrong guy (with same name and from same city) and guy #2 showed up thinking I wanted to have sex with him, I did not.",TIFU when I was txting my casual sex partner
330,tifu,"A couple years ago, I had a nightmare. A real bad one. One of the kind that sticks in your mind for quite some time after you've woken up. It was some time after Casino Royale came out. You know, the one with the torture scene in which Daniel Craig is tied to a chair while naked. My nightmare was more ore less this exact situation.

So there I was, naked and tied with arms and legs to a char. My torturer was using all kinds of methods to make me tell him some secret. Heat, cold, beating me, electric shocks, you name it! But nothing worked. I didn't break! I could see the frustration in the man's eyes and then the little sparkle when you know somebody has had a sinister idea. With great speed, he grabs hold of my balls, and with a vice-like grip starts to squeeze. I panic!

This shock is enough to push me over the edge to being awake. The last fragment I remember from the dream is that with a great effort of strength I manage to break loose with one arm from the ropes holding me to the chair. Unfortunately I haven't yet registered it is a dream, and in my newly awoken state I have a bit of a hard time realising what is real and what is not. The only thing I know is that somebody has my balls in their hand, crushing them, and that hand has got to go away, right now!

Sadly, The fine motor skills after a rough wake-up is not entirely up to par. Also the fact that there is nothing to slow down my hand racing towards my scrotum makes the impact even worse. I smack myself, right in the balls, with quite some force. As I lie there groaning from the impact the realisation dawns on me, It was just a dream. I lie a little while in the bed, too hurt to move, feeling stupid and embarrassed. After some time I get out of bed. There's just no way to go back to sleep after this.

so I've had a crush on this guy for about 5 years now and last year I made up this plan to confess to him, indirectly....

so I decided to text him with like a crap load of emoji's (cause back then I ***NEVER*** used emojis), to make it seem like I wasn't talking to him... so I go like: ""😜😜😜so uhm 😝 I kinda like you ❤️ 💕 💝""  and he left me on read for a solid 34 minutes, so about 7 minutes after that I say ""Omg im like super sorry my friend took my phone and texted you omg this is so embarrassing blablabla"" so then he's like ""k""

and now we barely talk anymore, but he did show up to my 13th birthday which was nice, but It was really awkward and It still is since that incident... sometimes I can't help but think he knew what I was doing 💀 he probably did too...... but it kind of screwed our relationship up a CRAPLOAD.. 

he's got a girlfriend now and I still got feelings for the guy... F for me ya'll....

TL;DR: I pretended to be my friend to tell my crush I like him and it messed up our relationship

so remember kids, don't confess to ur crush over text and go like ""omg my cousin took my phone"" or something like that",TIFU: by confessing to my crush... kind of...

Since my grandpa was home today, I decided to wear my headphones in my room. It had been a stressful day at the office. I go on youtube and play ""Train- Drops of Jupiter""

My mind becomes like a movie with music in the background as I imagine thrusting a woman's ass more and more. As I got close my toe arched up and I literally slid back from my computer chair, yanking my headphones out as i climaxed. Cum poured on my shirtless body.

333,tifu,"So last night my girlfriend and I went with a friend to go see the fan pre-release of Weathering With You. We hadn’t eaten all day and by the end of the movie we were starving. Now I love tacos, my girlfriend loves tacos, who doesn’t love tacos? We went to a hole in the wall taco place with $1.10 tacos and ordered a ton of tacos, and a quesadilla. The quesadilla. My girlfriend couldn’t finish the quesadilla so I wrapped the last slice in one of those little thin sandwich bags that people usually put stuff like radish or cilantro in and stuffed it in my sweatshirt pocket. It was a rainy night so when we got home I hung my sweatshirt up to dry and went to bed. 

Now to the TIFU. The next day I was getting ready for work and asked my girlfriend if she could throw a load of laundry in so I could have some fresh clothes for work the next day. My girlfriend is an amazing person and asked me if I wanted her to throw in my clothes that I had hung to dry. Why not I said, I mean who knows what’s in rain water nowadays? My clothes would’ve been soaked in that! Of course I would rather smell like Hawaiian breeze than acid rainwater. Welllllll, when I got back home that night she asked me if I saw her texts. I had not. She told me to look in the washing machine. Meat. Cheese. Tortilla. Everywhere. Stuck to the sides of the washer, stuck in my clothes, stuck to the ceiling, the walls, the cat, just everywhere.  

“My night was going so well” my girlfriend says with a sigh as we spend an hour picking out the deconstructed pieces of quesadilla from every article of clothing that ran through that greasy monsoon. Now my clothes are soaking in a combination of detergent and dish soap and I’m sat here hoping I don’t need to buy a new wardrobe in the morning.

This story takes place on a millitary shooting range, whilst i was in army basic. During a shooting session called ""Close range shooting 2""   


Storytime!  
In my basic platoon, we were roughly 50 people, for 10 shooting lanes, so people get put up into shooting teams. I hadn't been there for ""Close range shooting 1"" becouse i had assisted our sister company with their first aid exams. Instead of going in team 3 or 4 and talking with the others about what is about to happen, my dumb ass goes into team one. Our sergeants told us to load 3 mags with 5 rounds in each, easy peasy.

So i go up to the shooting line (15 meters from the A5 piece of papir), the  Sg (sergeant) in charge of the shooting line itself calls out to load 5, so i take a mag, put it in the rifle and pull the charge-handle. Sg then calls out ""You all know the drill, 5 shots 2 seconds"" Now this is the part where i fucked up, since what he ment was ""My machine will give a beep, then you have to seconds to pull your rilfe up, aim, and shoot, this will be done 5 times"". Where as my dumb ass brain thought i had to put out all 5 shots, on target, in 2 seconds. And instead of doing the sensible thing and asking if i had misunderstood anything, i just thought ""Nah, it'll be fine""

So i got ready, the machine beeped and i pulled up my rifle, removed the safety, found the target and send off all 5 shots. As i did i noticed the other shooters had made significantly less noise than i had, and thus realised my fuck-up. I very carefully looked over at Sg, who just looked at me whilst taking a sip of his cofee ""Op, what went wrong?"" And i had to admit i had misunderstood the instruction. 

My 2 saving graces here: 1) i had managed to hit with all 5 shots (some of us had only hit 3 out of 5 dispite having the full 2 seconds each time) and 2) I was a damned good soldier, so i was in Sg's good graces. All this happened on Tuesday, and i figured to myself that something -realy- bad is gonna happen. (This kind of fuck-up is basis for revoking my rifle license) But when we came back, nothing happened. Then wednesday...again nothing, thursday, i was getting ready to crap my pants with nerves but again, nothing happened.

Then it became friday, and i figured they were gonna hold us after hours. But as we were about to be discharged, our lieutenant recieved a phone call that the intire company were being assembled.

First thought: Fuck fuck fuck.  
Second thought: The captain wouldn't assemble 150+ people just becouse of this. 

So we meet up, three whole platoons in a horseshoe formation, the captain standing somewhat in the middle and talking.   
Cpt: Today i get a special joy, something i rarely get to do as a captain of a basic company. I get to issue a diploma!   
The captain then begins explaining how a private had decided to show off, by fucking up. and explained what i had done, and asked for me to approach, i did, and was handed my diploma ""Companys best close quaters shooter, demonstrated by collosal fuckup"" 

The week after i was ""randomly selected"" to help sweep the courtyard in the morning, so yea, a bit of punishment i suppose?

TL:DR:  
I misunderstood a shooting instruction, shot 5 times when i should've shot once, was given a diploma and a 5 days of sweeping detail.",TIFU by misunderstanding shooting instructions
335,tifu,"Oh my... Very long. Concise tldr at bottom~

I was 18 or so when I was dating this guy who was into sci-fi and otherwise ""nerdy"" things. I had not watched a single Star Wars movie in my life, had never been into watching tv, watching movies, or really anything that wasn't non-fiction. I also have a hard time remembering what anything is called. I can sometimes remember the shape of the word but not the actual word even if I can define it or give you examples. I have been told that it could be because of my adhd. ANYWAYS!

So, I am very into this guy and he seems very into me. I was and still am painfully awkward and not a social person at all so I am struggling to not make things awkward. 

At this point we had probably been seeing one another for a month or so and I am getting a bit more comfortable. We had been hanging out at his place watching something (either star trek or star wars, I can't remember... Don't hurt me) and then had gone for a walk to the corner store. He was saying something about the show and he used the word ""absolutes"".

 Now... My tiny disorganized mind thought back to hearing a conversation 2 people on the train were having some time ago. They were joking back and forth when one said ""only seeth's speak in absolutes"" which made them both laugh so hard that they cried. Being totally unkeen on what the hell that meant but feeling left out on a great joke I decided to make a note on my phone to Google it later. I typed in the exact phrase I wrote just now and it was autocorrected to do you mean ""why do *Sikhs* talk in absolutes?"". I think you can see where this is going. When I googled it there were no results that looked quick and easy to get the low down from but I did remember seeing something about Star Wars.

I guess in my mind the word sith is too similar to sikh because I have actually messed them up another time since then but anyways: so that flashback runs thru my mind in a split second and I am so impressed with myself that I know some cool joke about Star Wars that I can slide in so smoothly, and I say 

""You know what they say... Only Sikhs talk in absolutes.""

He stops walking. I look back and he is just staring. He says ""What?"" I am a little nervous but maybe he is just impressed, ""You know.. Sikhs talk in absolutes"" ... Right???? He starts laughing so hard he is nearly collapsing. Tears are streaming down his face. He can barely breathe. Oh fuck... I actually did it. I actually stole an amazing joke and he really thinks I'm funny :')

What is great about this is that he didn't tell me I was wrong. He also has me tell this one liner to some of his friends who also seemed to love it. So fast forward to last weekend. I volunteer in a great group at a foodbank every weekend. We have had a few Star Wars discussions recently and I usually just tune them out cuz I have no idea what anyone is talking about except... Last weekend. 

We are finished and are cleaning up when one of my fellow volunteers says ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes"". A few people laugh. I see an oppurtunity to steal the show with my classic line, so I reply ""yeah but only Sikhs talk in absolutes"". This time there is no laughter. I am scared to look at anyone's face but then someone asks what I mean and I say ""you know... That quote"". They inform me that is not a well known quote and actually they feel it has a racist tone. I try to explain the history behind me saying the quote and one guy starts laughing but a few people look confused. 

TL:DR I said ""You know what they say... Only Sikhs talk in absolutes."" to a bunch of very compassionate people. Volunteer is tomorrow morning so wish me even a few seconds of not fretting about it so I can sleep tonight :')","TIFU by wildly and offensively misquoting ""Only a Sith deals in absolutes"""
336,tifu,"TIFU. Well, this is more of a double whammy. I work at a state owned University/College. We have IM's we can send to other employees. I'm friends with someone in security/cameras. We were chatting about Roller Coaster Tycoon the other day and how to raise your park rating. If you are the un-initiated, in order to have a successful park you need a good park rating. My way was to find all the people with a ""poor"" attitude, place them on a piece of sidewalk above water and delete the sidewalk - causing them to drown. This in turn causes your park rating to rise (no more naysayers).

Well, I said something like ""I would have to straight up murder a bunch of people"" .... You can see where this is going. I then asked this co-worker a question about work. They copied my question and sent it to their superiors. What the person then came back and told me was, ""Oh my bad, the cops are coming - I sent your message PLUS the murder message to my bosses in security and they called the cops. Don't worry it'll be fine""

I felt like the biggest idiot ever. Eventually an officer and detective show up. Get my statement, name and identification numbers and tell me ""Ya know, we have to investigate everything"" and ""We know this is a big misunderstanding cause we understand the context"". But I still felt dumb. T-I-F-U

My co-worker apologized, but I think I'll make sure I only send them questions via email from now on.

TL;DR - My coworker accidentally copied a statement about murder talking about a video game, sent it to his bosses who had no context of the situation, cops were called, I felt dumb.

I think you can tell where this might be going. 

I have this crush on a guy from my class. Let's call him... L. And the classmate whom I'm following from Twitter, knows him too. (They're pretty close friends.) 

So my friend had sent a screenshot, talking about how she likes the name [the same name as L]
And so, I couldn't stop myself from saying, ""That is also my crush's name! I love that name!"" And that's where my fuck up begins. Now, initially I don't know if my classmate saw it or not, because I had the option where it showed who saw your message turned off. And I'm not sure if he had notifications turned on or not. (Assumably off though. We spam a lot.)

I hear nothing from him for,,, about an hour or so? Until he messages me on Discord. We chat for a few minutes, and then I bring the subject up.

Me: You saw NOTHING in that groupchat. OKAY?

my classmate: I saw it.

Me: WHAT. NO. NO. NO U DIDN'T SEE IT. WHAT DID YOU SEE?

my classmate: I'm glad you have one. (a crush.)

Me: so you know I have a crush on *?

my classmate: Yea

So, this happened right after I started my job (about 2.5 years ago)

It was maybe my 3rd or 4th day, and I was just getting let off of the leash with my trainer. My job was to drive a tugger around the plant and pick up empty carts, return them to the kitting areas, and take full carts to the assembly lines. Easy. Like stupid easy. So, I had down time in spite of being so new. 

Now. I’m not a people person, but being that i was new and wanted to make a good impression on my boss and new coworkers, I was making efforts to be more friendly and helpful than I normally would be; we all know how that is, right? 

Well, I’m driving along with nothing to do for a few minutes  and I see this guy that has dropped a big pile of parts and is having trouble getting them picked up. This is important: I had never seen this guy, and I was coming up from behind him when I made this offer.  I say “hey, do you need a hand with those?” Dude just stopped, and oh so slowly stood from his bent over position, holding both his hands out in front of him, bent at the elbow so his hands are clearly visible, and starts turning around to face me. It is at this moment that I realize that this man is, in fact. Missing his left hand. 

I will be honest, I don’t remember if I said anything, but let me tell you I have never ran from anything that fast in my entire life.

339,tifu,"I'd say before Christmas I was fairly vanilla with masturbation until a friend bought me a bullet which helped rekindle my excitement and made the experience much more enjoyable, and because of this I thought to myself - why not buy more toys? The first one spiced things up more surely one more count hurt right?

This morning I said my goodbyes to my Dad &amp; step mum and they said they would be spending the weekend at my step grandparents which meant I had the whole flat to myself, not only that, but today was the day that the new toy arrived (the toy being a pocket pussy or something similar to that).

So heres me walking around the flat fully naked getting everything prepared for the new toy to be used, lube, tissues, you name it. The full enchilada. I start watching porn as per and am having a great time - the box it came in says ""blow your mind &amp; your load"" and its done exactly that.

After the business had been done the dreaded clean up stage is here and I'm waddling to the bathroom like a penguin holding in a dodgy shit, pants round the ankles and a smell of shame wafting through the air. I clean myself up and then the toy, but didn't have a towel to dry the toy off so decided it would be a good idea to leave it on the kitchen counter and I'd sort it out in the morning.

Now this is where the fuck up happened, after that I continued my business as usual, back to my computer to browse reddit and listen to some tunes, next thing I know I hear a loud shout from the kitchen

""What the fuck is that?!!""

""Ewwwwwww""

Then it hit me, because of my loud music I wasn't able to hear anyone coming into the flat and my dad must have decided not to go back to see my grandparents.

He was now staring at this tainted fake pussy that I've left to dry on the kitchen counter where food is regularly prepared. That feeling of dread came over me in a second and I ran out to the kitchen to grab it thinking that the damage wouldn't be that bad, oh boy was I wrong, the look of disgust on that mans face was horrifying.

How can I look this man in the eyes ever again?

I'm currently beginning my search for moving out as I'm writing this post. Wish me luck.

I was changing them during an after school club so nobody was in the bathroom while I was changing them. There were a bunch of bands in the sink so obviously I assumed they were mine. The 1st one I threw away because that’s kinda gross. Then the second one I saw I said to myself “I don’t wanna waste them” so I rinsed it and put it in my mouth. After about 15 minutes one side of my mouth was hurting so much more than the other one and I had no idea why. That same one was a lot thicker too and I just thought the other one was stretched out. 

I then realized the rubber band I put it from the bathroom sink was not my rubber band. Writing this, I realize it’s so much grosser than I originally thought. Who knows how long they were in there? There could’ve been dozens of people who washed they hands over it AND I PUT IT IN MY MOUTH.

341,tifu,"Hello there, this happened this morning and I'm definitely too scared of saying it to my dad because he'll laugh at me until he dies.

So last September I moved out to my first apartment with my friend. We live in a region that is pretty dry and open. The winters here are crazy cold. You know Alaska or Nunavut ? Well, that's our spring weather.

Starting in November I started plugging my car's block heater. A simple outlet in front of my parking.

Time was going on and I realized that my car had some difficulties to start. It was weird cause I bought my car battery last January. So I kept on plugging it. At one point we had a week we're it was -40°c ( -51°c with the wind ) and my car sounded like it was choking himself with a big fist. It didn't want to start.

This morning I installed a brand new battery blanket on my car because I thought my block heater was broken. 

The battery blanket didn't work. Wasn't helping. So I was about to call my dad when I thought to test the outlet with my phone charger. Just in case.

Well, the outlet wasn't working. I then texted my landlord and she told me that it isn't normal and to try the switch in the closet of the appartment. 

The. Switch. That. I. Never. Knew. The. Utility.

We only ever met on smoke breaks, but we got into mailing lots, because lately there has been nothing to do and I wanted to prove (no idea to whom) that I can converse in a language I do not know. How could that go wrong? 

I kinda mentioned I had Spanish during my first couple semesters of Uni, however I neglected to mention that I barely passed A2. And it was five years ago.  So I don’t speak Spanish, as you may have gathered... but I learned some words so I can make some pointed jokes. And we have been messaging a lot. Like a LOT. He in his native tongue and me abusing the poor language by chasing all I need through google translate and skipping the parts I thought I got. 

This is where it all went downhill. 

Our conversations went everywhere and I skimmed over it and thought I got it all figured out. Pedro seemed really ok with my answers too. 

Anyhoo he asked me out in Spanish, which is his native language in which he is fluent and eloquent, and I said yes and now I feel weird and I only got it a week later because he ONLY writes in Spanish and google translate screwed me over and now I feel too weird to chicken out.

It’s been a long week, y’all feel me? So, being the natural 17 year old that I am, I decided to do my norms routine: jack off, take a shower.


See, my dad doesn’t like this routine. I doubt he know about the jack off part, but mostly because I’m running up the water bill(yeah my fault, but who doesn’t like hot showers?) 

Anyway, here I am, going to town. Headphones in, going at it. Normally I only lock one door, the one to my room. Tonight though, I locked both, which is where i fucked up. 

See my dad knocks on the door, and ofc, I can’t hear him. So, he unlocks it. He comes in. He doesn’t knock again on my bathroom door, thinking I’m the shower. He came to ask what I wanted for dinner.


He opens the door andddd


Yeah.

346,tifu,"Ok so, like the title, there’s no details going to be posted here. Mainly because has nothing to do with this post.

So I obtained my pilots license a while back and today I just felt like a good day to go for a fun scenic flight with my best mate. Just enjoying the view and do the same thing we always do in the cockpit, and that’s just talk a bunch of nonsense (of course not while I have concentrate). Anyways so we get into a airspace that’s completely unmanned, we broadcast our positions every few or so minutes, etc.

So there’s me and my mate, having a fat conversation over a girl I had sex with the night earlier. And being mates we discussed most of what happened (she was rather a freak on the sheets) anyways, I told him to keep quite while I do a radio call to broadcast our position, altitude etc. I finished the broadcast and began rambling on about the previous night’s adventure. 

We went on about what happened in rather good detail and after about 3 or so minutes we were coming up a mandatory reporting point and I was about to broadcast again, my finger clicked the PTT button again but this time there was not click, nothing, just a hard stuck button... A cold chill ran up my spine as if someone just poured ice water all over it lol. What my sweet little dumbass did not realise is that the PTT button occasionally would “get stuck”. 

I disengaged the PTT, and within a matter of seconds pilots from all over the airspace were climbing down my neck like nobody’s business. I had pilots swearing at me, calling me unprofessional, threatening to report our registration...all shit and sweet however there were the select few who thought the whole shit show was just a comedic moment. Some were congratulating me and even a bloke offered to buy me a drink.

Probably not one of my brightest moments, however definitely one not to forget and hopefully be able to share with others later in the years.

347,tifu,"Hello! This is a bit of a choosing beggar story too, but since, IFU, it goes here.

 This happent about a couple of years ago. I have blocked the guy numerous times, his real and all his new accounts he later made, in an attempt to contact me and had been free of him till recently, minus the occasional awkward meeting in our small town where I ignore his presence and he seems guilty about it. Recently IFU again, by trying to be polite and civil with him since we met and I was forced to acknowledge his presence and made the mistake of telling him Good morning. He stalked me for an hour after in the market and sure enough, new msg in Facebook from his new unblocked profile appeared (which led me to post the story here).I have to beg my husband again to intervene.

 The story :

 He is a dorky m, late 20s, still virgin, 2m tall, 130kg, I am a married f, late 30s, 1,67m, 140kg. He messaged me in Facebook one day to ask for a favour. Until that day we had a polite how are you, how's it going from time to time, but didn't keep much contact since I stopped working with him. I was the motherly type with him while we worked together because he reminded me (and acted a lot like) my nerdy, dorky teen son (so I never lead him any other way). 

  I had recently started training as a beauty and nails technician, going to a local community college, (a dream I had since teen) a fact that I had shared with him in a previous contact. So he messages me one day to ask for a favour. He confides in me that he is still virgin and has a foot fetish, and begs me to ask around my co-students for a girl willing to have foot fetish sex with him for 50 euros. I tell him that I can't do that and advise him to try his luck with the professional sex-workers in the city, or with a call girl. He tells me he can't go to the city, no transportation or day off, plus it would be too expensive and he really needs it, that he is desperate and that's why he was bold enough to ask me about it. I JOKINGLY reply, that I wouldn't have done it for less than 100euros, let alone more kinky stuff for less than 150euros and that he has to up his sum, if he wants to have any hope, no normal girl would prostitute for that cheap. Long pause. After a couple of minutes I get a message that's something like "" you know what, you're right, you'll have to do"" and asked for a place and time.

 I didn't get it at first, but after it clicked, I was furious!

  I don't know what was more insulting, the ""you'll have to do"", the thought that I was offering to prostitute myself for money, or that he thought me cheaper than a prostitute but I WAS PISSED! I told him to fuck off, blocked and unfriended him. He made a few new accounts and tried messaging me, to tell me how sorry he was that he insulted me and how much money do I want. I kept blocking him. 

 He started stalking me around town, was suddenly at every market I was, trying to talk to me and I know it's not a coincidence because he stayed outside the butcher's for 15 minutes, while I small talked to him ( butcher and husband same soccer team fans, he offered a free ticket for the next match), waiting for me to come out. At some point he tried to ""talk to me"", while stalking me, while I was shopping with my teen girl, in which I had enough of it and mustered the courage to talk to my husband about it and show him the logs. He was furious with me, but messaged him to inform him what he'll do to him if he dares to bother me again and that we'll tell everyone what he's been up to. 

 Thankfully, that worked for a couple of years, he didn't bother me again and apart from a few awkward meetings in town, where I ignored him, he left me alone.... 

TL;DR Untill the stupid, polite me decided it should be ok now, he clearly got the message and to offer a pleasant hello two days ago....Oh how to tell my husband to intervene again... 

 What still frustrates me is that he would not accept any negative reply from me, but a male, telling him to not bother his female property, and threaten bodily harm is apparently enough!",TIFU by making an ex co-worker think that I'll have sex for money!
348,tifu,"This happened just a few minutes ago. I am now unable to sleep.


So to preface, I live in a frat house, and every semester we switch rooms. I arrived on campus a few days earlier than most people usually do, and the person who previously lived in my room hadn't moved out at all yet but he was out of town.


I was really excited about this new room, so I asked him if I could move out most of his stuff for him, and he reluctantly said yes. So I spend hours moving his shit out, and here is where the fuck up is revealed. After moving his shit out, I decide to call it a day and start to put the sheets on his bed, which he said he would leave.

As I'm putting on the sheets, on the side of his bed against the wall I find a roll of toilet paper. Then I find a dried up wad of what I assume is his cum in toilet paper. I don't find this too alarming, as I suppose we all forget to dispose of our late fun once in a while. And then I look further down the side of the bed. I find dozens, upon dozens of dried up cum wads. All along the side. All the way underneath the bed. Possibly over a hundred. 


I had just found myself upon an entire semester worth of this guys cum, and I am now typing this freaked out and unable to go to sleep in the cum graveyard.


TLDR: Moved into a room. Found dozens, if not over a hundred dried up cum wads and now I can't sleep in my new room.",TIFU by moving into my new room early [NSFW]
349,tifu,"This just happened this morning. So here I am, butt ass naked in the shower, already dreading my 25 minute drive to work while weaving in and out of traffic and sucking down cheap Keurig coffee. I’m not sure about you, but when I’m showering early in the morning before work, I try to get everything done in about 4-5 minutes. That’s where the fuck up happened.

As I’m vigorously shampooing my big egg-shaped head, I make my way towards the front of my hairline. All is well. Suds are good. Head feel nice. Then, all of a sudden, in comes my finger. Right in my eye. Past my eye. Into the nether realm that is uncharted territory that is my eye socket. Just as quickly as my soapy, wet finger went in, it came out with a gloriously disgusting *pop*. Did I just finger my own face? Yes. Now everything is sore and things are fuzzy in my right eye. Happy Friday.

350,tifu,"So this happened only a few hours ago but I don’t think I’ll ever have the courage to venture out of my apartment again.

So idk why or where I came up with this but me and my dog have been doing this weird thing that we call the Gooba Gooba since she was a pup. Basically, whenever we are walking and I have her on her leash, we do this really weird thing where I stop, put my hands in front of my body, look at my dog, and say GOOBA GOOBA. What occurs next is hard to explain after these events and makes me want to curl up into a ball, but here it goes:

As soon as I say those words, my dog gets super excited and starts almost like hopping back and forth super fast. And while she does that, I start taking these giant, Frankenstein like steps, bouncing my hands up and down, while bobbing my head all around. It sounds absolutely psychotic and makes no sense but hey, my dog freakin loves it and she looks so happy every single time we do it. Mind you, we only do it when we know there are no witnesses around for obvious reasons. Until, of course, a few hours ago. 

So Reddit, of course, I go to take my dog out since I got to work from home today. After she does her business, I bring her back inside the apartment complex, and the coast looks clear. I see my dog getting kind of excited as she knows what’s coming next. So I stop suddenly, my dog does too, and I say GOOBA GOOBA!

Cue my dog hopping back and forth with what looks like a demon like laughter, followed by a grinch like creature taking these wild lounges and shaking uncontrollably. All is going dandy and well, until we are cut short but the sudden scream of “OH DEAR LORD!”

Turns out one of my neighbors was in the process of leaving her apartment when I entered the complex and had just opened her door. I’m guessing she was either talking to her husband or waiting on something cause everything looked closed for a solid 5 seconds when we scoped the hallway. 

The pure terror and confusion on this 70 year old woman’s face is something I will never forget for the rest of my life. My brain only allowed me to mutter the word “STOPPING” in my panicked state, which seemed to cause even further confusion and fear in my neighbor. I immediately ran back outside with my dog, who also seemed equally embarrassed and followed my lead without hesitation.

I walked around the building a few times, avoiding making contact with her until I could get back inside. And here I am now, unable to ever show my face in fear of having to explain something that is pretty unexplainable. Today, I fucked up.

For the longest time I had just set my phone down in my cup holder and would glance down at it occasionally to make sure I was still on course but this started to become annoying the more I had to do it (plus in the cupholder I can't plug in my phone).


So I got one of those magnetic phone mounts with the little metal disk you stick to the back of the phone. I have been using it for a few days now and love it, its a neat little thing. 


So tonight, I decided to throw my phone onto my wireless charger while I was in the shower. After I got out of my shower and dried off, I go to pick up my phone and nearly burnt the fucking shit out of the palm of my hand. 


It turns out with the metal plate on the back of my phone on the wireless charger, I was basically microwaving my phone while I took my shower.


I ran outside and pulled the box from the mount out of my recycle bin and looked over it and nowhere is there any kind of warnings about use with wireless chargers. Hopefully they add one now... god damn

It's a powdered kind and all the others I have tried were liquid flavors. I make up a fresh bottle of fizzy water and dumped the new flavor in. It immediately starts foaming up and over flowing so I puts my mouth over it to try to catch the foam. Turn out it is a super strong reaction similar to coke and mentos.

353,tifu,"This happened tonight, but it needs a little backstory:  
   
&amp;nbsp;


In case you didn’t know, Redbox is getting rid of their game rentals, so you can buy them for cheap. Last weekend, I saw three games I wanted for cheap, so I tried to buy them. The box wouldn’t take my card so I called their support and waited. When I finally got through, they said the bank was declining my cards (the box was charging them from Illinois or something so it was flagged for fraud). So, I left a little bummed but no worries.  
 
&amp;nbsp;


Now, here’s were the I fucked up:  
  
&amp;nbsp;


I’m a teacher of 7th and 8th graders. I really like the kids, but I am an introvert so being around so many high energy people all day is very draining for me; Fridays are especially draining. (It should be noted that I teach at a charter school in one of the lowest-paying states for teachers, with a degree in electrical engineering and no former teaching experience, so teaching is pretty rough right now). I’m exhausted and my girlfriend yelled at me for something out of my control (we’re working on that lol). I'm ready to relax, so I ordered myself a pizza around 4 pm (I usually skip lunch so I was pretty damn hungry) and when I pick it up, I realized I had a visa gift card from a student with me and figured I’d go try buying the games from Redbox with that.  
  &amp;nbsp;

I get there to find out one of the games is gone. I was again a little bummed, but there was nothing I could do about that. I tried to get the other two with the gift card, but it kept asking for a zip code. I realized I didn’t register the card online, so it wouldn’t work yet. I registered and tried again, but still had no luck. I called the phone number on the card and they said I had to wait for at most one hour.  I decided to eat my pizza in my car and wait for a little bit.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


Twenty minutes later, I was done eating and decided to try again.  I get to the box and there is a Redbox employee there restocking it (it was really cool to see inside, to be honest).  I start making conversation and make sure she wasn’t taking the games out (she wasn’t) and we talked for about five minutes about how Redbox was discontinuing their game renting program because people kept stealing them and it wasn’t economical. She was super nice and friendly.  She finished, but the machine had to load everything, so I stand there for another five minutes waiting. I finally get to try again and it’s still not working (I figured I hadn’t waited long enough).  The lady comes back because she forgot to put a few disks in. I let her do her thing and tell her I was bummed because it wasn’t working for me. She said the machine didn’t take visa gift cards because people would rent DVDs then claim fraud. She suggested I try a Redbox gift card online. I went to the Redbox website and used my visa gift card to buy a Redbox gift card. When I try to use it to check out, I am notified by a lovely error message that said gift cards could only be used for DVDs and Blu-rays. Now I was more than a little bummed.  
  
&amp;nbsp;


I called Redbox and waited and waited. When I finally got through, I explained my issue and they said there was nothing they could do: gift cards couldn’t be used for games and all sales are final. I asked to speak to the manager to see if they could help me. I sit in Safeway for about an hour, on hold, just waiting for a manager. My phone is going to die, so I decide to go home. I spent two hours there trying to make this work.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

I am still on hold and I have currently been on this call for almost two and a half hours. I am so exhausted and I was just looking forward to relaxing tonight, but instead spent the majority of the night trying to make this right.  
  &amp;nbsp;

On the bright side, I now have a $25 gift card to Redbox (even though I don’t even rent movies because I have ADHD and forget to return them). So, I got that going for me, which is nice.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR : I tried to keep working at something instead of cutting my losses and just wasted my night.
  
E: After 3 calls and a total of 3.5 hours on hold, I got a refund :) (hopefully the refund actually comes haha) still exhausted but I little less bummed :)",TIFU by trying to buy a game at Redbox

For Christmas, I had asked my family for an electric beard trimmer, as I have to keep my facial hair neat for work. All I have is a razor, and I don't want to be clean shaven. 


I am a happy guy because this beard trimmer I received works wonders. It easily glides, and is almost effortless to use. With such efficiency, I figure it must also be just as good at keeping the man bits nice and tidy. Oh how foolish was I. 


Not even 10 seconds into hedge trimming, I nicked my balls with the trimmer, it didn't hurt too bad, and I don't see any blood, so I continue, this process happens a couple more times until finally-AHH FUCK! MY TAINT!


I'm glad I was home alone because I don't want to have to explain my shrieks to my family. I manage to undo God's work where he stitched me up, gouging open part of my taint. And here comes the blood... Good thing I was doing this in the shower, I turn the showerhead on to clean myself up.


Cleaning myself up was almost worse than the initial accident. It stings and burns like a motherfucker. After having gotten dressed, I find myself walking around with my legs spread like I got soaked at a water park, trying to avoid my bits all rubbing together. The feeling is comparable to dumping a colony of pissed off fire ants down my gitch.


I think I'll stick to the razor from now on.

355,tifu,"This happened today, about an hour ago and I’m cringing with regret and feel incredibly bad. My girlfriend and I had planned to have a sleepover at my house, without her parents knowing. 

A little backstory: we’ve known eachother for about 4 months but only decided to be exclusive ever since 2 weeks ago. Since then we’ve hung out at her place 4 times. 2 of those her mom caught us fucking,(yeah, this wasn’t the only fuck up.) but hey, she’s a cool mom that’s understanding and just doesn’t want to see a granddaughter anytime soon. 

Here was the plan (that we couldn’t even complete 25% of): 
Step 1: Pick her up and have her come to my house, while her parents think she’s sleeping over somebody else’s house. 
Step 2: Have her meet my mom (She hasn’t even met my mom yet, lol.) and then chill out till my mom leaves for work at 6:30.
Step 3: Have her “get picked up by her mom” (AKA hideout until my mom leaves and then have her come back.
Step 4: Vibe.

Well, not so much, I reach her house and lo and behold both her mom and her dad are walking with her to ensure she’s actually going to the place she says she’s going to, which she decides to rush to the car, and I do a really shit turn into a driveway, and accelerate in reverse horribly, and drive away knowing I’ll definitely have to turn the car around. Mom calls, yep, it happened, and so we go back and drop her off near her house, and I go home, knowing that she is going to get the Jesus treatment, and be verbally crucified. Me and my brother tell my mom that her parents didn’t like the fact that 2 guys were in the car, just to make up some bullshit lie so that I don’t get in trouble either. Now I’m sitting here, knowing that her parents are going to DESPISE me, and that I will probably not see her for the longest time. We both genuinely love each other but I’m sure that can be written off as just something adolescents say when they’re horny. I just feel so bad but the worst has blown by for now and she’s calmed down a bit after losing a huge chunk of her parents trust. I’m definitely going over and apologizing to her parents for making them have to worry about their child’s safety. Time heals everything is what I tell her, and for now, it’s all we can do.

I’m in a postgrad program in college where all of my peers are 3-9 years older than me, so I try to seem like I’m not a tiny baby whenever possible. In this scenario, I was late for my Marketing class after sleeping through my alarm and rushed to get to school. I grabbed my laptop off my nightstand and didn’t think to check it first. I’ve often brought it to class after watching netflix or youtube and open it to the video still in full screen, so you’d think I would have learned my lesson by now. 

I got to class and left my laptop shut for the first little bit to take lecture notes. On a class break, my group members for a project came up to me and started chatting about said project. I figured I would open my laptop and show them the part I had been working on. Here comes the fuckup. 

I open my laptop, type in my password, and 12-inches of HD lesbian porn pops up on the screen. In particular, this was a raunchy looking ass-eating frame (which I’m not super into, hence why I paused the video on that screen). I also want to mention that the title was something along the lines of “Hot lesbian babes hardcore scissoring”, which also made an appearance on screen. 

I immediately shut my laptop and looked to see if anyone had noticed. Two of the girls didn’t, but one of them did and she gave me the most sympathetic smile while also clearly trying to hold back laughter. I shot her a “did you see that” look and she said “Don’t worry, you closed it pretty fast.” Thankfully she was bi and didn’t seem too disgusted by my late night internet adventures. 

Have I learned my lesson yet? No. Since then I’ve also opened my phone browser at a Best Buy to show an employee the product I was looking for and instead opened up good ol’ PornHub, and I’ve opened my laptop while a nude thumbnail of myself kept jumping up from the downloads folder. 

Will I ever learn? Probably not. 

However, I don’t think this holds a candle to the time my ex opened her google drive on a projector screen in class and broadcasted a full frontal crotch nude for a good three seconds. I still feel so bad for her. Will any of us ever truly learn to protect our NSFW content?

One day my friend Martin, was going to treat me to the whirlyest of whirls, and he started to turn me around in the swing. After a couple of minutes I was close to a meter higher of ground, than when we started. The rope was creaking and cracking, and letting of little dusty poofs.
Sure enough, when the torsion overcame the rope, it collapsed on itself, tightly gripping my balls in the knot.

This particular morning I decided it was probably a good time to shave my armpits (something I've done for the greater part of the last 13 years). First armpit done, onto the next, also successfully done.

And then... As I was moving my hand that was holding the razor away from my pit, it glided past my happy little nipple and suddenly this crazy stinging pain hit me. I looked down and saw blood starting to drip down my body. It was literally one of those slow motion moments where you see what's happening and realize ""I'm an idiot...""

Mum: What happened?

Me: I can't tell you... (Still giggling)

Setting the scene, I (36M at the time) and my older sibling (41F) were working through our recently-deceased mother's (74F) possessions in order to clear her house.  We stumbled upon her Kindle during our room cleanups, and my sister came out with the fatal line:


 ""Awww, she used to love reading.  I know she's bought tonnes of books from Amazon over the years.  I wonder what she's read recently?""

 
Blithely, I opened up my mother's Kindle library and, well...

For those who can't be bothered to open the photos, they are a small sample of the titles she had purchased.  I snapped these photos in a moment of insanity but felt the need to keep some sort of evidence.

""Diapered for Pay"" and ""Breeding my Sleeping Wife"" are particular gems, however ""Hot Cooking Spanker"" takes on a new dimension when you consider her former occupation as a chef.

Suffice to say, the expression on my face made my sister grab it out of my hands.  Turning bright red, she muttered ""I knew I shouldn't have introduced her to 50 Shades"".

TLDR:  Found deceased mother's Kindle.  Discovered her late-life sexual awakening.  Not enough mental and eye bleach in the world sufficient.

Edited to add a couple of points:  Thank you for the awards, and thank you also for those pointing out the This American Life piece on https://www.thisamericanlife.org/689/digging-up-the-bones/act-two-4.  I'm thinking of tracking this guy down and starting a support group.

363,tifu,"This was a huge fuckup and something I can never discuss with anyone so I'm sharing it here.

I was chatting with my friends this morning when the topic of illegal file sharing came up and my one friend mentioned that they still use the file sharing platform Soulseek. Soulseek is a program that was popular in the late 90s and early 2000s that still exists and works now. It has much smaller user base today than it did then but is still somewhat active. To share files you designate a file directory that you want shared and everything in it becomes available for download. In around 2010, I was a big collector of music and at one point I had hosted my entire music library on the platform to be shared. About 800 GB of content. I didn't really think much of this at the time and had pretty much forgotten about it until now.

I still have the same computer and hard drive that it was shared with, and it's been online this entire time. I checked Soulseek this morning for the first time in years to see if it was still active and look at how my files were doing. When you look at your files you have the option of sorting by your most downloaded. I did this and saw that the most downloaded files were all jpgs and videos. The file path was My Name &gt; My Music &gt; Albums &gt; The Cure - Pornography. In college, I thought it was funny to put all of my saved porn in the same folder as the Cure's album Pornography. This was mainly made up of professional videos that I had saved. When I saw the jpgs, I realized that I had put nudes I'd received from my ex there with them. They had been individually downloaded over a thousand times each. The file names were number strings but some of the videos had names of porn stars in them, so I assumed people searched for those and then looked at the containing folder and found the photos. They showed her face, identifying tattoos and the inside of her bedroom. All I could do was look in shock and disbelief and disable everything so they couldn't be shared anymore. I'm not in contact with my ex anymore but would obviously be beyond mortified and betrayed in her place if I had found out about this.

Back in August 2016, I was going into my third year of uni and I had gotten a job as a campus representative of an Israel Advocacy group called StandWithUs (I'm pretty involved with Israel Advocacy if you have a different political view just keep it to yourself this isn't the time/place) and the first thing you had to do for this job is attend a week long training conference in California (I'm from Toronto).

So I attend the training course in Oxnard, CA and on the last day of the trip everyone has to go back to LA to catch their flights back home. But all our flights were way later in the day so everyone had the day to kill pretty much. So one of the guys on the trip said he was going to a dispensary and was basically going around and taking orders from everyone to see if people wanted stuff. Well, I made a friend on the trip, let's call him Ben, and he wanted to split an edible. Since I'm all about peer pressure I agreed.

But we didn't wind up getting the edible until right before we had to go into the airport to start going through security (like 2h before flight) so on our way to the terminal we just split that fucking edible and downed it. It was kinda like a tootsie roll and it tasted awful.

Anyway, 20 minutes later we're getting through the giant line for checking bags and shit at the airport and they're making everyone go through that giant full body scanner where you have to put your arms up and that thing spins around you. Well, the second I step in there that edible hits me full force. And I'm immediately at my usual high that I'm used to.

And I'm like yeah, this is nice, I can do this. Then we finish up with security and we basically have 90 minutes to kill before the flight. And then I just kept getting higher and higher and higher and it was legit one of the worst physical experiences of my life. I felt paranoid, I couldn't listen to music because it made me anxious, and to try and calm myself down I bought a giant bag of those kit kat chocolate bite sized candies and just started fucking inhaling them.

Usually like 4 bites of chocolate makes me nauseous, but not this time (or so I thought) and I downed that whole bag. Cut to a few minutes later and its closer to our flight time and we're just waiting in that area while they start calling people to board. I promptly lean over and fucking vomit all over myself and the floor. And then we're called to board the flight.

I run over to the bathroom and do my best to clean myself up and then run back to the plane only to be greeted by two security guards and some paramedics. Someone from the trip who didn't know I was high called them and these guys were NOT fucking down to let me on the plane. They were convinced I was gonna get sick and cause the thing to land or something and they thought I should go to a hospital. So, while still VERY high mind you, I had to convince them that I was fine and just had a stomach ache and threw up but now I'm all good. After like 15 minutes of talking to them they DID let me on the flight and I immediately passed out and I felt high for like the next 2 days and hated it.

TL;DR: had an edible at LAX, greened out, threw up, and almost got kicked off my flight.",TIFU by greening out at the LAX airport

 Both me and my partner work a lot, so it's not uncommon for us to ask each other what our plans are for the weekend. It is also rare that we are off together on the weekend at the same time like a Doomsday Prophecy. So this weekend I made the joke that I dont have to share they were all mine for the weekend since neither of us had errands to run etc. 

Cue misconception 

I get a text message a few minutes ago asking where we were going on our date and what kinda clothes would work... I have no date planned.

Anyways, the Internet was a very strange beast back in the ancient times. Most websites were white with black text, blue links &amp; little scrolling messages under everything. So many flashing lights. No safe-search, so bad for kids.

There was an auction site... possibly owned by Yahoo but I’m not sure... that let you sign up for an account and bid on things. When it asked for a credit card I just put in random numbers and it  was accepted as valid. Can you even imagine..?

This was at the height of the Furby craze, when rare or elite models were auctioned off for fortunes. So I went and found the rarest Furby I could; striped or only pink dots or cashmere or something, &amp; places a ridiculous number in the bid. Something like $206810582058205672976. And as the highest bid it won!

I was quite alarmed, so I msged the guy &amp; explained I was a kid &amp; didn’t actually have any money, &amp; he kindly withdrew my bid. I don’t remember him even being mad.

Somehow I was never caught, by the teacher or nearby classmates. In a Roman Catholic school, where punishment was implied damnation and self-shame for the rest of my life. It all feels like a fever dream these many years later. I also stole a trackball from one of the mice.

TIFU. It has been. A whild ride. Let me exaplain! 
Last nite I took too much ambiens because I have not been getting sleeps well in the last week due to long standing anxiety and worry about life. I had to be at work at 8 am this morning so I set my alarms before bedtime last night but despite this and because of the ambient I was unable to awaken during alarms so I overslept. Woke up at 830, threw some cloths on and ran out the door and zoomed to work without shower or deo. I work long hard days in a factory and it was hot today no ac. Just fans. So I got a write up for be late. Fine. I deserve that. So I get off work and stop by gym to hopefully sleep better tonite. I do my workouts and go home. When I got home I wanted to be naked to relieve of the day. So I took my cloths off with intention of playing with ms kitty. But the stench overcame me, smelled like combo of  peasant farmers after a day in the fields and cheap tuna factory. It was so bad I passed out hitting my head on my night table as I rolled off the bed. When I woke up on floor giant not on head so I call 999 and go to A&amp;E where they tell me I have a serious concushion and that mean I can not work for 2 weeks when I have to get re evaluate. So what am I going to do. I have ruined my life as I will not have income and am late already on rents. I will be evicted beginning of feb I am afraid plus might starve. I ruined my life all bc I overslept skipping basic hi gene principals and got too ripe in my kitty.

369,tifu,"Obligatory, this happened a few weeks ago when it was a lot colder where I live. And I know this is probably pretty mild compared to other posts on here but I figured I'd share anyways.

So, some backstory: 

I 23(M), due to circumstances out of my control, am temporarily without a vehicle. Currently pinching my pennies as much as possible, and it's been a bit of an adjustment but I've been making it work. I get rides to work in the morning from my roommate, and I am able to get rides home from a few generous co-workers. Far from ideal, but it works, and I'm not complaining at all. Another thing to note, is my phone is an old, POS, Galaxy s8, which had been giving me issues with the battery, it won't charge through a cord, only wireless charging from an old pad thing my roommate gave me. Anywhoo, on to the story.

Well, the day in question was a Friday back in December, the crazy busy day was wrapping up and the snow was coming down. Because the day was so busy, and I'm an incredibly antisocial introvert who hates asking ANYONE for ANYTHING, I was putting off asking my one coworker for a ride home. 

I was busy pretty much up until closing, and I was starting to head to my coworker to ask for a ride. However, my boss intercepted me and asked if something on our back lot was taken care of. I wasn't sure so I slipped back there to take a look. By the time I was coming back to the front of the building.... All the cars were gone. Everyone had left. 

To be honest, I wasn't too surprised, as I hadn't actually asked anyone for a ride, they probably assumed that I had gotten a ride from someone else (or just didn't care, they ain't my babysitter lol). And I was just standing there, holding my lunchbox with 2 options. First, I could text my co-workers and ask them to turn around and get me (and I'd sooner sit there till the next day than inconvenience someone like that. Self esteem issues, woo). Second, I could get a Lyft/Uber.

So, I went with the second option. I ordered the Lyft (phone at 32%). And was standing there in the cold, looking like a dunce because my coat got locked inside the building. And this is where my fresh hell started. I don't know if it was the cold, or if the universe decided to take a shit on me that day, but when I checked the status of the Lyft, my phone was at 15%. That was when I started to worry, my phone battery never dropped that fast. By the time the Lyft was 10 minutes away, my phone was hovering at 3%, and I refused to open it unless it was to check that my ride was coming. Eventually it inevitably died. And I was standing there, with no way to contact anyone, or even see the status of my ride. 

After waiting for 20 minutes (I could see a clock through a window of my work) and no Lyft in sight, I figured that my dead phone must have somehow cancelled my Lyft, or they just didn't show. 

Now, I'm starting to get concerned. I don't have any numbers memorized, so I couldn't ask to borrow a phone because it wouldn't help me anyways, and I tried the nearby gas station to see if they had a charger, but they didn't have a wireless one so I was out of luck. 

And that is when I psyched myself up and was like ""WHELP, guess we're walking!""

Cut to two hours later, when I finally arrived back home, I walk in the door, right past my confused roommate, wondering why I was covered in snow and home so late. All I said was ""For future reference, it takes me almost exactly two hours to walk home from work"" and went straight to bed.

PooPoo phone died, leaving me stranded in a snowstorm.",TIFU by walking home for 2 hours in the snow

""Ya know what? I'm gonna treat myself to a comfier toilet seat and some real estate out in the front office latrine instead of the one in the back thats all cramed and smelly!""

My boss is ok with this considering the other one is usually taken so we can come and go as we please back and forth.

So I pull up to the curb and drop the browns off at the super bowl.

371,tifu,"This happened over time but concluded yesterday. I'm a college kid who doesn't have too much luck with the ladies. Met an awesome girl last summer who happened to go to my school and had one semester left. We were just friends and saw each other a couple times at school. I'm terrible at reading signals when they might be aimed at me but I never thought she was into me. I always kinda liked her and had begrudgingly accepted my fate in the friend zone. Over winter break she messaged me kind of out of the blue and after chatting I suggest we meet up. Later I realize it's just the two of us at a club and that it might be a date. I figured screw it and eventually made a move and we hooked up.

A couple days later I suggest going on another date. I knew it would never work out because she had graduated and was travelling but figured why not have more fun. Fuck up is that we clicked and I caught feelings. Night ended with us just embracing each other for two hours in my car outside her parents house. She didn't ant me to come inside because that would have made it harder to finally say good bye but not wanting to let go because then the moment would be over. Finally she left and I had the drive home for some self pity.

372,tifu,"My memory of this event is not entirely trustworthy, because it happened so long ago, but I think I remembered it well enough due to the memory being ingrained in my mind due to my fear at the time.

So, a bit of backstory: my parents owned a small pool while I was a kid, but it would always attract these weird-looking black wasps. They were a little bit shiny, but that doesn't matter. I have always been a bit scared of bugs, especially ones that can bite or sting me, so I tried to steer clear of them, and will still FREAK THE HELL OUT if one lands on me.

So I (7-8 years old at the time) was outside, just sitting down near the pool in the summer, when I realized that there was a small black object on my leg. At that point, I started to flail around trying to get it off of me, and I walked a good few feet away before calming down. But then, I looked down, and the black object was on my leg again. So, I flailed around some more. Rinse and repeat for about 5-10 minutes, with me getting progressively more panicked and desperate, until I had the bright idea to just go into my house. So I ran inside, slammed the door, and sat down on a chair. I had escaped death itself. But then I realized that the black thing was still on my leg, and I swear I jumped a foot into the air, at least. But then I realized that it wasn't even a wasp. It was a loose string from my track pants that had somehow gotten balled up at the end. I felt both happy that there was no wasp, but embarrassed that I had, you know, ran away from a string for the last five minutes.

TL;DR: 7yo me mistook a loose thread on my pants for a wasp and ran from it in extreme fear for the next five minutes, before realizing otherwise. I nearly had a mental breakdown at that point, and I still HATE bugs to this day.",TIFU by freaking out about a wasp
373,tifu,"So, this actually happened about 4 hours ago and the inferno has subsided but good God... the only thing I can compare it too is, well, dipping my junk in molten lava seemed like it would feel better.


Now, this is mildly NSFW because sex and human anatomy will be involved.


So, awhile back I had planned to go home for a couple weeks to see the family and attend my parents retirement party. I get time off from work approved and figure it where I am going to store my car for the time. She offers for it to stay at her place. I agree and start setting up the plan to keep it there and have her drop me off at the airport. Being the humans that we are we start talking about how terrible that drive would be and having to deal with traffic like it was satan's gift on earth. We both decide it would be a smart idea to book a hotel room, since the drive with mild traffic was about 3 hours. The room is booked and now we both feel a lot better because we dont have to deal with traffic and it's only a 12 minute drive from the hotel to the airport. Fast forward to last week.


Being the normal humans we are, our primal nature takes over and we start talking about all of the dirty deeds that we want to do to each other once we get to the room. Of course this gets both of us hot and bothered, especially since our schedules havent been able to match up well enough for us to have the time to get down and dirty. For those of you that regularly keep your manhood/womanhood trimmed or shaved on a regular basis, even when you aren't gettin any, good on ya. For those that are like me and get lazy with it from time to time... here comes the FU.......


So, I leave Sunday morning to go back home. Our blissful night at the hotel is taking place Saturday. I start thinking of what I need to do/bring to make the night so much more enjoyable for her. End up thinking to myself that it's been a month or so, I need to clean up and manscape a little bit. I get in the shower and proceed to lather up with the shaving cream and CAREFULLY go to town shaving. Making sure I get everything. It all goes well and I'm thinking to myself, internal high fives all around cause I didnt cut myself. Clean the shower floor up and all that jazz. Ya cant prepare yourself for doing the hanky spanky and not clean up your mess.. After that's done I grabby body wash, not even thinking about it... MY BODY WASH IS INFUSED WITH MENTHOL. It took less than 2 seconds and I felt like the fiery sensation of 13,000 suns was upon me. I quickly rinse every bit of it of. Step out of the shower and the cool air MAKES IT WORSE! I'm standing there, grabbing my junk like a 4 year old standing in the dairy aisle saying ""mommy I have to pee!"". I know no matter what I do, I just have to ride it out and itll eventually subside and go away. I continue to dry off and its slowly getting worse and I'm having a hard time focusing. All I can think about is that the fires in Australia are probably ice cold compared to the burning going on down south.. Trying not to cry like a just had my favorite stuffed animal get thrown in the trash, I crawl into my bed. Curl up into a ball and start praying like I was about to die. Cause it sure felt like my soul was burning from the inside, out.

The burning sensation has finally subsided and I feel normal again. I message the girlfriend and inform her of what happened...needless to say, she ends up on the floor literally laughing her ass off. She got enjoyment out of my pain, so now reddit can too!

374,tifu,"
UPDATE: I went back to work today, everybody just seemed happy I was okay. Managed to crack a few jokes. Wiped out all of my sick time. I'd say it's a decent trade-off.

Obligatory not today, but yesterday.
Also, apologies for formatting -- I'm on mobile.

The story starts Sunday, when I'm told I have a norovirus from my local express clinic. I was incredibly nauseous, so I left with a script for an anti-emetic and a note excusing me from work for 2 days. 

I took the anti-emetic Monday and Tuesday, sat back, and binge watched Netflix. I had food delivered and I barely had to think, move, talk, or anything. 

Wednesday morning, I get ready for work and head out. On my way out the door, I took one of the pills to ease my already uneasy stomach. My doctor told me that if within a half hour my nausea doesn't ease up, to take another, so at my desk I down another.

Within an hour, the drowsiness was overwhelming. I was cramming work in because I knew I would be too tired to do it later in the day, and I might go home an hour or two early to rest. Within two hours, multiple coworkers were telling me they wouldn't blame me if I headed out early. I assured them I was fine, bought an energy drink from the vending machine, and chugged back along. I noticed that I wasn't able to speak professionally and I kept forgetting things in the split second it took between reading it and writing it. I blamed it on the brain fog that comes with fevers, despite my fever breaking the day before.

At some point, the nause was hitting me hard again. I figured a third pill would be too much, and sitting wasn't helping, so I decided to walk around the building and get some air. By this point, everything felt ""hazy"". Or, at least that's the best way I can put it. 

I walked down the halls and rather than look ""crazy"" by turning around and pacing, I decided to go downstairs and make a loop around the building. I made it down one flight successfully, and then proceeded to walk straight ahead despite processing that there was another flight. I slid down, said ""oh shit"", saw a student (I work at a university), said ""oh shit"" again, got up and tried to walk away. The student stopped me, asked if I was okay. I tried to brush it off as nothing, but I think she saw something was off, and asked if my blood pressure was low, if I needed to eat, if I should go home. I brushed her off and kept walking. A  coworker made me sit down when I told her I fell, asked if I was hurt (I very proudly said I could feel the pain, but didn't care), then had me take the elevator back to my desk.

I recounted my plight to another coworker who very gently insisted that I let her take me home. I somewhat fought her, but I am so glad she managed to get me in her car to go home.

I called my boyfriend once I got home, tried to explain what happened, and he kept complaining that I was speaking gibberish. I got frustrated, called my doctor, and they quickly told me to go to the ER. I had my mom take me.

Once I got there, everyone kept asking if I had hit my head, if I had taken any illicit drugs, and asking the standard questions to test memory. They held me for a few hours and I slowly felt more aware of what was happening. As I did, my ankle and ass hurt more and more. 

The ER doctor explained that I had a very rare reaction to my nausea meds that caused me to be confused, disoriented, dizzy, essentially high. He also told me that I bruised my lower back and sprained my ankle in my fall. And that I tried to flash him when I first came in.

I spent today dreading explaining this to my coworkers tomorrow, and dreading them telling me anything I might have forgotten that I did. FML.

Important note: I cannot cope with stressful situations and get extremely nervous easily

We get in the car (my bf, his brother, his other grandma and I), my boyfriend drives and I play navigation device and tell him where to go.

Anyway, my sister was saying her goodbyes before leaving tonight, and I was busy getting my chores done before staying up so I can sleep before my shift tomorrow. I was keeping an eye on the door, so when my sister's boyfriend (SBF) came back in my dog wouldn't run out.

In comes SBF.

SBF: ""Oh man, it is raining a lot harder than I thought it was.""

Me: ""Yeah it has been picking up the last hour or so... by the way, you weren't planning on taking a shower tonight, were you?""

SBF: ""No, wasn't planning on it.""

Me: ""Good, if you were you'd have company.""

We both stared at each other for a full 5 seconds processing what I just said.

SBF: Wat.

For context, the chores I was doing was watering my many houseplants. I would put the larger ones in the bathtub for a few hours during this process. That is what I was referring to as ""company"". I was making sure I did not have to move my soggy ferns so he could take a shower.

Me: ""Uh. Just go look in the bathtub.""

He ran from me like Joseph from Potifar's wife. After looking in the bathtub to ensure there was company there besides me, he peeked back in through the doorway.

SBF: ""Ah. I see. On that note, I'm going to bed.""

Me (half joking, half not): ""Yeah, get out of here.""

378,tifu,"I will start this off by saying I am a high school teacher. I’ve been a high school teacher for the past five years since I graduated college. I love my job and my students, but there are A LOT of them. Every teacher has had to act like they remember a student they’ve totally forgotten about when that student sees them in public. I probably have to do that more often than most people. Alright, on to the actual story. 

Over the past couple of months, me and a man who rides the same bus to work as me have been making eye contact and smiling at each other every morning. At first, I tried to make small talk, but he always seemed nervous. I just assumed he was shy, so I backed off. Eventually, it seemed like he had warmed up to me. He began talking to me everyday and ultimately asked for my number. I happily obliged. As he got off the bus after this interaction, he told me he was “looking forward to catching up.”

Obviously, I hadn’t recognized him at all. I thought back to every job I ever had, every person I had ever met through mutual friends. I couldn’t quite place him. Naturally, not wanting to admit to this guy I had no idea who he was, I started trying to provoke him to bring up how we knew each other. I would purposefully bring up how it’s been a long time since we saw each other in hopes he’d reply with more information. Eventually, he said something about how he used to have a crush on me and would “always look at me during class.” Reading this message, I come to the obvious conclusion we went to high school together. This made total sense to me. It’s been a decade since I graduated, so I definitely don’t remember every guy I had a few classes with. Plus, this guy seemed a couple of years younger than me. He wouldn’t be the first underclassmen ignored by a senior he had a crush on. 

In any case, I decide to play along, replying that he’s sweet and I’m glad we’re talking now. At this point, he asks me out on a date. I agree, and I’m actually very excited. 

Fast forward to the date, and things don’t exactly go as I expected. We don’t have a lot to talk about, and he’s a lot more awkward and immature than I could have possibly anticipated. He fumbles around his sentences and sweats profusely. It’s a nightmare. I considered making an excuse to leave several times, but I decided to stick it out. It was just dinner, after all. 

When my sweet, sweet savior (the check) finally arrives at our table, he’s quick to put his card down. Knowing this will be our final date, I decide I should cover my half of the check. I grab the book to look at the cost and slide my card inside, too. As I’m placing my card next to his, I read his last name, and it all starts coming back to me. I can remember his braces. I can remember where he sat in my classroom. I can remember scolding him for being late to class and not turning assignments in. I can remember it all. And suddenly everything about this guy made a lot more sense.

To get started on our project, I needed to start by making a few docs for different aspects of the project. I was also assigned the task of delegating tasks to my team members. Once I had everything set up, I told my team member:


""Okay, slide into my doc and I'll show you what I want you to do."" 


I said this innocently, I did not mean to make a docking joke. Seconds after I said this, our teacher said:


""beansprout2001, you're treading right on the line there.""


I'm now wondering what I did. Then it hits me. I made a docking joke by accident. In order to remedy this situation, I determined it would be good to say:

382,tifu,"TIFU Walmart and Edibles are not a good combo...

So, I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this story but oh well. So, this happened this past summer but I’m still embarrassed about it. Btw this is gonna be a long story so just prepare yourselves. 

So a little about me, I’m not a lightweight when it comes to Weed and Alcohol. I’ve been drinking since I was 13 and I’m the type of person where I can do like 5 shots and barely be tipsy and same goes with Weed. So basically, I don’t hold back on those because I know it usually takes *a lot* to get me High/Drunk. Also, very important you know before this incident I had never tried edibles. 

So this past July, my friend whom I’ll call S and I decided to take a road trip from Southern California all the way to Mountain View for the 25th anniversary of Warped Tour. So I pick her up and on the way we end up picking up a shit ton of weed and my friend gets a small pack of gummy edibles for herself. 

So we drive up and we get to Mountain View early afternoon. We check into the hotel and we decide to share a blunt and my friend offers me 2 gummy edibles which I accept but I think I only ate one(?). Eventually, we decide to go to the Walmart 3 blocks away to pick up some groceries with plans to go up to San Francisco for the rest of the day just to hang out. 

So we drive to the Walmart and literally the second we walk through the doors, I get higher then I’ve ever been in my entire life. So this is where the story kinda goes haywire. So we grab a cart and go to the chip aisle and the last thing I remember was my friend trying to figure out what we should get and me holding onto the cart for dear life. Then after that, I don’t know how else to explain it besides I blacked out. I just remember one second being in the chips aisle, blinking and the next second being on the complete other end of the store with my friend talking about something else. I don’t really remember what she was talking about but I remember just being like, 

“Holy shit how’d we get here?” 

Then, I black out again and this time we’re in the dairy aisle. And this time when I “came to” I remember standing there even more confused then the first time I came to. And at this point, I started to feel like my entire body was vibrating and no matter what I did I tried I couldn’t stop shaking. For some reason too in my ‘higher then giraffe pussy brain’ thought that I was just a lot higher then i’d ever been and was like, “Damn girl this feels sick! “ all this time, I was still holding onto the cart for dear life and my friend had no clue what was going on. 

Then I started to feel like I couldn’t breathe and no matter how hard I tried I literally could not get a breath in. That my friends was the moment I realized, I’m having a panic attack in the middle of Walmart. And to this day, I’ve never had a panic attack that severe ever again in my life. Somehow during this entire situation my friend was completely oblivious to the entire thing so i turned to her, grabbed her shoulder and said to her. 

Me: “ I need to leave *now* “ 

S: “ Why what’s up? “

Me: “ I really need to leave *now*!“ 

Eventually I think she realized what was happening so she takes some cash to pay for the shit that I picked out and I literally booked it out of that Walmart, went into my car and cried hysterically until my friend came back and drove us back to the hotel. We didn’t end up going to San Francisco and I ended up crying my eyes out in bed for the rest of the day until I fell asleep. 

I apologized to my friend the next morning for causing a scene and ruining our plans and she said it was fine but I still feel really guilty about it. So, yeah that’s my story.

TL;DR: I got too high and freaked out in Walmart.",TIFU and got high at Walmart...
383,tifu,"I had come home from work to sheets in the washer from this morning and wanted to put them in the dryer before they got mildewy. 

My two year old (human) was with me and was bouncing around her play area calling for me to open something for her so I had been slightly distracted. 

Turns out, during this time, our part Siamese and mostly all white cat had hopped in and camouflaged herself with the sheets. 

For my sheets, I like to use the anti bacterial (extra hot) setting to make them feel extra fresh. I configure this setting and press “start”

Before I walk away, I hear a “thunk!” .... “thunk!”  ....“thunk!” ... “thunk!”...  “thunk!” As if I put a pair of shoes on the tumble cycle. 

Considering it’s sheets, a thunk was unexpected. I thought maybe something was off balance and to investigate i paused the cycle to adjust the dryer but then I hear the “MEEEEOOOWLLL”

However, we have been eating pretty healthy for the last few months so I decided to keep it going. So I grilled up some steaks, yellow peppers, onions and green beans. Afterwards, I began clean up work and started doing the dishes. While drying off the Tongs, the cheap piece of crap decided to spring open and the metal ring that keeps it clamped together sprung out and bounced all over the kitchen. I kept looking and couldn't find that tiny thing. So I called her over and told her ""If you find this little ring before I do, you can order all the Doordash you want this weekend."" Naturally, she got to the Kitchen using Instant Transmission, like seriously, I've never seen her move so fast. So she starts looking up and down the place and also cannot find that little metal ring. Finally we get to the garbage disposal... I did not see her put her hand down the disposal and I went to go turn the light on above the sink. Well, the switch for the light and the Disposal are right next to each other. My dumbass accidentally hit BOTH switches when I went in for the light switch. The disposal turned on while her hand was almost all the way in. Luckily she pulled her hand out fast enough before any real damage happened. Needless to say, I have never heard my GF curse at me so much in my life, but it was well deserved. Afterwards, she found the little ring, so we are having a Doordash meal this weekend. I am still Shook about what happened.

So over the weekend, I decided to make a smoothie in the morning with some vegetables and fruits. I never had made this particular smoothie before, but let's just say it tasted like shit. So I left my nasty ass smoothie in my blender bottle on my desk and just went about my day.

Completely forgot about this thing on my desk the entire day and went to bed with it still there, closed inside my blender bottle. Woke up the next day, had to leave early, rushed out of my house still forgetting the putrid smoothie on my desk. Same as before, I come home that night and just knock out.

In the middle of the night I hear a loud *POP*, shit sounded like a gunshot, so I woke up. It's dark as hell and I see that I'm still alive, so I just shrug it off and go back to sleep. Once I woke up in the morning though.... Jesus... It looked like someone planted a bomb inside a cabbage and just set it off in the middle of my room. Fucking green plasma *EVERYWHERE*... All over the ceiling, on the walls, on my bed, just... Everywhere. 

I just stood there in shock, like how the hell did this happen? Then I saw the bottle on my desk.... The cap wasn't on the bottle anymore. Whatever evil juice was fermenting in that bottle made its escape. Science is crazy. I spent 3 hours cleaning that crap. It's Friday now and I'm still finding random blotches of green goo in corners of my room.

Throwaway because of the shame lol

So. My husband and I live with my family (parents and grandparents). The hubby and I live in a separate apartment on the ground floor, while everyone else is upstairs. The house has only one washer and one dryer upstairs. As you might imagine 6 adults living their lives in hot and sticky FL creates a lot of laundry, and with only one set of machines the load gets backed up once in a while; no biggie, we push each other's laundry through all the time not problem.

Well, I have some skin issues that make sexytime painful sometimes, so my hubby and I use a few toys when we're feelin' frisky. I'm really paranoid and usually make sure myself that all the evidence is put away since we have family/friends coming over often unannounced and I would be mortified if they saw Big Sexy or Ashley the Pocket P\*\*\*y sitting out on the nightstand. Well, after one night of fun the husband said he had cleaned and put **everything** away and I was tired so I thought nothing of it... The next morning I stripped the bed and started the laundry. Little did I know Ashley had gotten caught up in the sheets and was being washed with the bedding..

I got busy with work so my mom finished pushing the laundry through and put it in my basket for me..

I brought the laundry in and found Ashley in a **ziplock** bag at the bottom of the basket.

She hasn't mentioned it and I can't look at my mom for the next week I'm so embarrassed.

Info: My parents are very open and sex has never been a taboo subject in the family, I'm just mortified that my mom had to see that, and while I'm embarrassed I'm sure in a few ~~decades~~ days  it will be a hilarious family joke.

Okay so this didn’t happen today but a couple days ago. So I went over to this girls house that I met on bumble. And she’s a stripper if that means anything. So I went to her place and before I go on a date or anything like that I always chew minty gum. So I show up and we’re watching Disney plus and I’m thinking about kissing her so I swallow my gum cause why not. So we start kissing and all that and one thing leads to another and she’s giving me oral. It’s really sloppy so yenno a lot of saliva is everywhere and we have sex (used a condom) then I stay for a little bit longer because I have work the next morning. Well at work the next day I use the restroom and go #2 and as soon as I finish I feel this icy hot burning sensation between my cheeks and I instantly thought STD. So I’m freaking out all day thinking I contracted something. Well I go home and go straight to the bathroom and spread cheeks in the mirror. I don’t see any redness or anything but I do see a bluish brown chunk stuck in my ass hair. Guess what it is? A fucking piece of peppermint gum. So that’s what was freaking me out all day, making me think I have an STD. Took a shower and felt fine.

A bit of background for why I can tell that this happened: I've been taking a new medication which has been making me a very heavy sleeper, opposite of what I usually am. I usually sleep with my phone next to me to watch YouTube while I fall asleep. I also use my phone as my alarm.

So last night I get done studying for the last final that I was supposed to take today and it's about 11:00 so I get in bed. Set my alarm for 6:15, put on a youtube video, and drift off. 

I was in such a heavy sleep that in the morning when my alarm went off, I turned it off in my sleep since it was right next to me. 

I turned off my alarm in my sleep *on the day of finals.*

So usually if I misses the bus or woke up late, I'd get a ride from someone. Well, no one at my house has a car right now, and everyone else is at work or taking finals...so I'm fucked.

391,tifu,"Obligatory - this happened few years ago, but to this day there are scars on my soul. It all started when I was bored as hell (that time I was low on cash, but whole days were spent on searching for a job).

  


There is this radio station with alternative music, like rock or metal and they are often giving away tickets to concerts, you just need to answer some questions on their site online. So when I was bored I surely tried to win something, this time it was a ticket for a Motorhead concert in my city. Days passed and I had no response so I just forgot about it. But suddenly I got an email - ""Congratulations! You have won ticket to a Motorhead concert!"". Whoa. It was a shock for me, cause I don't remember last time when I had won something. Of course I was happy as hell. When is this concert? The exact same day that I got e-mail with tickets. Fuck me, but really? Next day I have a job interview. And it's a good looking job. I was really looking forward to it, so I wanted to be extremely prepared. Scrooge mode went on and I decided to sell that ticket (so I would have some money *just in case*) and go to the interview accordingly prepared.

  


In case you were wondering - I fucking love Motorhead. But at that time in my life I had no money, no job, and only opportunity to change that fact (as I then though) was this particular interview. In my defense I should mention that there were pretty legit rumors about Motorhead concert next year. I figured out, that I would have money then, so I'll buy a ticket and have some fun without concerning about which kind of cardboard I'll have for dinner.

  


No.

  


Lemmy (frontman) passed away about a month after their concert in my city...

  


... and I didn't get the job.

  


I know that maybe it's not big tifu, but I lost an opportunity to watch live one of my favorite bands because of a job that I should foresee I won't get (it's a whole different story, next time maybe). There is one bright side to this whole situation - now, when my life is a little bit more stabilized, I just know that I should really enjoy things I love, especially when that ~~thing~~ band did a ton of speed in the past and now all are in my grandfathers age.

392,tifu,"So this actually happened last night, but anyways

I was hanging out with my brother and we were drinking a lot. I think I had at least 15 shots of vodka. We were really hungry and decided to make some curry and rice. 

We were boiling some water for the rice on the stove. I stumbled and fell over, and I accidently grabbed the handle of the pot (always point the handle away from the edge, folks) and dumped the entire pot of boiling water on my arm. At first I didn't feel anything, but a few moments later I felt an ungodly amount of pain on my arm. I immediately started to rinse it under cold water. At this point I almost passed out from the pain, on a scale of 1 to 10 it was 50. I've had some bad injuries before like slipping a disk in my back, but this was on another level. 

The skin was very red and leathery. I sat down and watched some TV to distract myself from the pain. I stupidly sprayed fucking icy hot on it, which made the pain even worse.

I eventually fell asleep after talking a few more shots. I had a hard time sleeping because of the pain, but I did. I woke up around noon and noticed my arm was completely blistered, peeling, and scalded. That's when I took the pictures.

I don't have my car right now since it's in the shop, and I live in the boonies so no Uber or even a bus. So I couldn't go to urgent care. I'm still waiting for a friend to read their damn messages so I can get a ride, but unfortunately I don't think I can until tomorrow morning.

I was being a asshole to everyone and everything that crossed my mind for no good reason. Lie's, insults, and stupidity made up the mass of this recording. An occasional good idea for movies, video games, and rap songs came out of this dumpster fire of word salad. 

It's now Jan 2020. Anything salvageable from that tape seems to have been used. The movies I watch have the actor I desired for the role I wanted them in, the games I play use the mechanics I envisioned for the genre, and what little grasp of English I had at the time seems to have inspired better artists than myself to make something worth listening to. 

I dreamed of working in the entertainment industry in my youth and now, in middle age, I find myself walking around in a world filled with joy that I had no direct control in creating.

Being (M19) a young and broke college student, a good 3-in-1 shower gel is great. Last night after getting back from a workout, I  needed a nice long hot shower. With nothing to do the rest of the night, and a girlfriend 300 miles away, (Long Distance) I decided that it wouldn’t be a bad time to crank one out. For some reason, my brain thought that maybe, just maybe, the 3-in-1 would be a great change from the dry or spit method. “It’s meant to clean your body and hydrate your hair, how bad could it be?” I thought. And as it turns out, it does make great lube. Slick and bubbly, it was not to shabby if I should say so myself.  With everything washed off and squeaky clean, I dry up and head to bed.

I look to find that my once freshly shaven coin purse has now dried up so much it resembles an actual leather coin purse more than a scrotum.

The day started out well. I woke up deciding that today was the day that I would dye my hair. 

I walked into the beauty store with the color green in mind. After standing and staring at the 500 choices, I decided on a forest green from a popular, Demi-permanent vegan brand.

I get home thinking all would be well and this would be an easy process. I was wrong.

Now, I have a LOT of hair. It’s down to my waist and is dark brown. It takes a lot of work to even wash it, and so I prepared myself for battle by squirting half a cup of conditioner into a bowl. When I open the hair dye, it’s actually a dark blueish green. Not what I wanted, but I’m hoping for the best so I begin to lather it into my hair. This was my first  mistake.

This stuff was uncontrollably runny, and with it being so dark, everywhere it went on my skin was stained. i was slowly being transformed into a smurf. Deciding I’m too far to give up now and figuring that it will come off of my skin later, I continue. Second mistake.

I leave it on for the recommended time, blah blah blah. Then it comes time to wash it out. 

I get in the shower and spend about 45 minutes trying to rinse out the pigment. By then, my hands and wrists are as blue as sonic the hedgehog, and I am already reaping the consequences of this horrible decision. Little did I know I was in for much more than I had imagined. 

I get out of the shower and wrap myself in a towel. I leave the bathroom, but on my way out I catch a glimpse of blue streaks running down my back. My asshole begins to burn. I remove my towel and do the proper inspection anyone would do when their anus feels like a furnace only to discover that it is dark blue. Not only that, but I have a streak running from my neck, down my back, and ending right where the sun doesn’t shine. 

I rinsed off, and I have been sitting here for about an hour, hoping that I won’t be stained forever.

398,tifu,"This happened a month ago and I still have very weird feelings about it.

If it matters, I am also a girl.

So I have a short midday flight to the beach to visit a friend at the beginning of December last year. I’m waiting to board and see an attractive girl sitting with another girl a few seats away. I’m not the most social person in the world, so I don’t try and interact that much. I’m wearing my ‘leave me alone’ oversized hoody. It has ripped holes I use for thumbs holes and looks grungey; probably making me come across as a drug addict or at least someone of questionable life decisions.

I board, then notice that these two girls are sitting across the aisle from me, one row back. I work up the courage to say something along the lines of “if no one’s told you today, you are stunning” which starts a very short conversation about where she’s going and that the girl with her was her cousin. Again: not often very social, so I kinda leave it at that.

As we’re about to take off, I again muster up a little more confidence to ask for her number. Relatively newly single and not uncomfortable with the concept of mingling. She gives me her number. Score! We’re gonna be in the same place for like a week! I immediately text her and she responds! Double score!!! Exchange a few awkwardly flirtatious texts then try and not bug her the rest of the flight. Get off the flight. Say our goodbyes.

Continue texting off and on. I’m an awkward flirter with girls because I really like giving compliments, but I feel it necessary to ensure that I’m not trying to objectify them because for some reason I always feel like I’m ‘the boy’ in the courtship game. Looking back, it’s a tough read, but I’m referencing the texts to give an accurate accounting.

Anyway, this goes on for two days until she asks how old I am. Me, being the oh so super coy person I am, tell her to guess! Because I do look pretty young for my age and always get flattered when people say early twenties.

She guesses 17...

Uhhhhhh wait, hol up...

How the fuck old is she, if she thinks I’m 17 and was down with the flirting? Like...20? 19? Maybe she was in her early 20’s like I thought and just kinda an ephebophiliac... I ask.

She’s 15 fucking years old.

I was 29 at the time. I am now 30 writing this. I realized I was dressed like a total street rat teenager when we met tho, so the confusion was warranted on her part. Apparently I’m just a creep.

I noped the fuck out of that communication as fast and respectfully as I could. I still feel super fucking cringey about it to this day, especially because of all the flirting (though thankfully it was pretty tame), but hopefully time will allow me to forgive myself.

PSA: I am writing this out because of all the news of adults hitting up teenagers and seeking inappropriate communication and contact with them. It’s gross and it’s NOT ok. As soon as I found out how old this girl was, she went from being attractive to being a child. It wasn’t ‘kinda hot’. It made me feel fucking gross. Yes, 15-19 year olds are fully capable of making their own decisions about whatever they want to, and that can arguably mean they are ‘adult adjacent’, but they’re still way too impressionable and immature to be attractive to someone my age. If you find their ‘innocence’ and ‘inexperience’ and ‘willingness to please’ attractive, it’s because you are controlling and manipulative. And if you’re hanging around until they’re ‘legal age’ and aren’t doing anything sexual with them until that age, you’re still a fucking creep. You’re fostering an emotional dependence that you eventually plan to exploit. Drake is a creep. Onision is a creep. Anyone else that does this is a fucking creep. End of rant.


TLDR: gave my number to a cute girl that I thought was in her early twenties. She was 15. I was 29 at the time, but dressed like a teenager, so she thought I was ~17. I corrupted a poor innocent teenaged girl with my creepiness.

399,tifu,"So about 4 days ago I uploaded a picture with three pages filled with fat yoshis - which I then proceeded to cut into individual yoshis.

I was planning to put them in my friends' bags/lockers etc, and just have some laughs.

About 2 hours deep into the school-day, we had an earthquake drill. My grade went to the soccer field. I thought this was the perfect opportunity to hand-out fat Yoshis, as they could be spread around the whole school.

So I started by giving my friends fat Yoshis. We then went around spreading fat Yoshis. Soon people were spreading then around. 

At this point, I had about 15 fat Yoshis left, and was on a bit of a high.

I saw this person which I recognized, partly because he was popular, but mainly because one time I accidentally threw an apple at him and he chased me around the school (I have good endurance so I was fine). Let me describe him for you:

He's tall, very muscular, has light blue eyes, brown hair that goes to the side and is overall a super-chad.


For some utterly unknown reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to give him a fat Yoshi. Suddenly my friends backed-off quite a bit.

Him: ""what's this?..""

*me, smiling:* ""that's fat Yoshi hehe""

He looked at me confused, and because English isn't our main language, he said (translated): ""huh - what's Patitoshi?!""

I giggled a bit, and said that that's the thing on the note. 

Before I knew it, his friends came by (my friends were still kind of around, looking) and asked what was happening. I explained the situation and they said ""what's Patitoshi?!"".

Now picture the situation. About 5 tall Chads surrounding this short, skinny boy who plays the Pokémon card game and watches YouTube all day. 

Basically they did their chad things (""yOu wAnT sOmE?"", ""dO yOu kNoW wHaT I tHiNk oF PaTiToShI?""), then one of them asked for a fat Yoshi. 


At this point my friends were already whispering to me that those guys are dangerous and that I should back off. But as they were surrounding me I kinda had to do it. So I took off my phone case (the notes were under there), and one of them grabbed all the fat Yoshis. He said ""do you know what I think of Patitoshi?!!"" and ripped them all up.

At this point I was trying to get away and drift into my group of friends. It took some time but we got away. They (my friends) then told me that I was lucky I didn't get my absolute ass kicked and got punched to death, and that you can't do that to that group of people. After the drill ended it was recess and a good amount of people were asking what happened, apparently it kinda spread around a bit. I honestly didn't know what I was doing.

I specifically asked my friend to walk with me home that day (he does most of the time anyway - I just wanted to make sure), as I didn't wanna encounter those guys alone.

TL;DR - gave the school chat a Fat Yoshi note and almost got my ass beaten. 

(also I now call fat Yoshi Patitoshi)",TIFU By Giving The School Chad a Fat Yoshi Note
400,tifu,"I’ve spent quite a while writing out my fiancé and I’s wedding gift list. We found an app online that allows you group a lot of stuff from different websites all together to send to your guests. It’s a browser add on so you can just add any item whilst you’re shopping and it automatically adds it to your list. 

We popped on the usual little gadgets, coffee machine, cutlery, dinner plates etc and were ready to send. 

Now here’s where the FU happened.  My fiancé thought it would be funny to put a few weird items onto the list for me to spot later. I’m a good checker so he knew I’d see it. 

I did not. 

I sent the list to over 200 members of mine &amp; his family, friends, work colleagues, grandparents and parents. 

Alongside the plates and coffee machine was a latex advanced kink set with handcuffs, ball gags, full body suit and whips, a 12 inch black dildo and a butt plug with a tail attached to it. 

It wasn’t until 2 days later when my soon to be mother in law rang asking why those items were on our wedding list that I realised what had happened. 

It was opened by 127 of our guests before I swiftly removed them in horror and told my fiancé that we must’ve been hacked. 

He then admitted what he did almost crying with laughter. Not sure whether I should contact my guests explaining the situation or just leave it for him to explain in the wedding speech.

401,tifu,"To start, this happened about 5 years ago now, but I just remembered it and figured I would share.

I was dating this girl for about 2 months at this point and I was at her house for her graduation party (from high school, if it matters). Naturally, I was there the whole day, helping to set up before people got there and after they left I stayed to help break down.

The expected grad party crowd comes and goes, but something is a little off the whole day, she's checking her phone and doesn't look super happy throughout the day, she keeps telling me everything is fine and she seems normal enough in conversation. I stay through the evening and into the night, everyone leaves and it's just her and I in the kitchen at her parents' house. I bring up to her that she looked upset during the day and if something was wrong?

This is where the FU truly begins because she immediately starts bawling her eyes out to me that none of her friends showed up to her grad party and how she and I had only been dating a few months and more of my friends showed up and stayed longer than hers did! (I had cleared with her if I could invite some of my friends beforehand, so that wasn't an issue) 

But like I said she was intensely crying her eyes out, and not quietly. I'm trying to console her by saying all the cliches, you know, ""Maybe they were busy"", ""\*Insert name here\* doesn't seem like a very good friend anyway"", ""You'll figure out what happened"". and things like that, but nothing seemed to help.

ENTER HER DAD: Yes, her dad hears her crying from the bedroom where he was and immediately springing up to help. So here's the scene, he comes out of his bedroom, still slightly drunk in his TIGHTY WHITEYS, and sees me consoling his crying daughter, saying things like ""I'm sorry, I wish I could help, You'll figure out what happened"" and whatnot at like 1:30 AM in their house. So he starts losing it on me, asking what the hell I did and what was wrong with me and what did I do to his daughter and whatnot. 

This was followed up by profuse apologizing and overall embarrassment for him because on top of this whole outburst he was still in his delicates.  We got a good laugh out of the whole thing and would joke about it until about 3 and a half years later when his daughter cheated on me. 

Tl:dr - Stayed after a grad party to console my crying girlfriend about her friends who didn't show up, her dad heard me consoling her super late at night and thought I was the cause of the crying. He stormed out of his bedroom and berated me while wearing tighty whiteys and the whole thing was hilariously awkward.",TIFU by staying at my girlfriend's house after a party and trying to be a good boyfriend

So this story starts a ways back when I set up my Google account. I rarely use my real name online, and most of the time I enjoy using immature names like 'Berry McCockinner' or 'Howie Fildersnatch'. I decided to go with 'Dixie Normus', and never thought twice about it. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, my wife says I should start using the chick file a app since I eat there so often. So I sign up, and use my Google account to log in. Easy. 

So over the last few weeks I cruise through the drive thru and scan my app and start accumulating points. Cool I guess. Never had an issue.

Today I went in for lunch and the line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, so I said fuck this imma go in and eat.

The line inside is long to 6, so I utilize the order online feature, and wait.

Naturally, I was concerned, and about to call the cops. So I roll down my window right as she’s walking by and say “Are you okay? Do you need help?” She approaches my window and it becomes apparent that she is not a small child, but a little person. 



She said “Yes, can you help me with a ride?” I told her “sorry but I have to go back to work.” She then said “do you have any spare change? I’m really hungry” Out of sheer awkwardness for the entire situation, I gave her all the cash I had ($2) and my breakfast burrito from Jack. 



She didn’t actually look homeless at all. Very put together and with clean clothes. Even if she wasn’t, she did seem like she needed the burrito more than me. She was walking in 3 inches of snow and 25 degree weather after all. But damn did I want that burrito.

405,tifu,"About five years ago I took a solo trip to Myanmar for four weeks. It was a last minute decision and I had just a short list of ideas and places to see. Spent a few days in Yangon (Shwedagon Pagoda is absolutely stunning). Took a night bus to Mandalay during which I endured the Burmese water torture. The AC vent above my seat leaked water onto my head for all 12 hours (tried sealing it with chewed gum, bits of paper, parraffin for my boots- no luck).

On my short list of must-dos was taking the train to the town of Hsipaw in Shan State. The appeal of the ride is that it is conducted on a 19th century line (that pitches, rolls, and yaws as much as any boat I've ever been on) and that it crosses the Goteik Viaduct (a wooden trestle spanning a river canyon at a height of 100+ meters).

To take this ride, most travelers board in the town of Pyin Oo Lwin about 50km outside of Mandalay. I planned to take the train on a Monday morning and hitchhike from Mandalay to Pyin on Sunday. I started early around 7:00 am and managed to flag the first passing truck. The driver seemed happy for the company (even though we couldn't communicate much) and I found myself in Pyin Oo Lwin at about 8:30 in the morning and much earlier than I'd expected.

I found a guesthouse in short order. The young man working reception had studied English in Hong Kong so I decided to pick his brain about what to do with my day. He told that there was an impressive waterfall near town and that all I needed to do was find the market at the top of road leading into town and look for a path behind it. I suppose it's my fault for not asking but his description suggested to me that it wasn't particularly far.

Quickly located the market and the path. Proceeded down the extremely declinated path. For some considerable time. It's also May, in Myanmar so it's 40+ and humid. After I while I contemplated turning around but decided I must be closer to the bottom than the top and that if this place was worth seeing there would likely be someone posted up nearby selling goods that might include water.

After what I reckon to be close to 10km, I reached the bottom. And lo, there was a tent. And a man and a woman cooking food and selling drinks. As I approached to buy water I noticed a wooden table near the river accommodating half a dozen Burmese soldiers and adjacent to them a small pile of empty whiskey bottles accumulating on the ground. My instinct was to give them a wide berth as I speak neither Burmese nor whiskey-fucked Burmese and wasn't really interested in drinking at noon in 40 degree weather with a long uphill hike ahead of me. But as I was paying for my bottle of water, I felt a hand enthusiastically clap my shoulder. I turned and found myself being heartily greeted by a thin Burmese man whose uniform indicated he was likely a lieutenant and whose eyes were redder than the Devil's dick. I didn't need an interpreter to know that the spittle laden nonsense pouring from his mouth was my invitation to join them for a drink. I don't like to decline hospitality and didn't want to seem rude. So I thought: I'll join them for a single slug of cauterizing Burmese whiskey and give them a hearty 'cha kwa' (something like cheers) and move on to the genuinely beautiful waterfall just beyond the river bend (for anyone who's interested it's Anisakan Falls on the upper Irrawaddy River).

My plan did not work. After being escorted to the table, I was presented with a fucking pint glass of neat, shitty Burmese whiskey. Then introductions were made and each of my seven companions seemed to require an individual toast with me so I found myself draining nearly half the glass in the first three minutes. The latter half got drained some 20 minutes later when apparently we all needed to toast something else. As I sat there in dread of what I knew was coming, the lieutenant's phone rang. He answered and after a brief exchange, made the rally gesture and whistled. At which point my companions stood up, shouldered their rifles, and briskly fucked off into the jungle (apparently whatever they were off to do could be handily accomplished blind drunk).

So there I sat, alone, sweaty and dehydrated as well absolutely fucking gorked at 1:00 pm at the bottom of a canyon somewhere in northern Myanmar. I resolved to at least enjoy the waterfall and after briefly terrorizing a local picnicking family managed to communicate my request that they photograph me on an outcropping of rock just beneath the falls. I fell in the river only twice making the transition and owing to the distance I look halfway civilized in the picture. And the wet clothes proved fortuitous on the utterly fucking miserable return hike.

My SIL is from Germany, and I am from Catalonia (Spain) where it's common to hug and kiss people hello. I was invited to my SIL's place back when she and my sister were still dating (not yet married) so that I could meet her family and spend Christmas with them.

Recently my girlfriend and I have decided to order a few more toys for the bedroom and we've been excited for them to be delivered. I got them sent to my own place since I live with family and someone is always in and no one would be at my girlfriends place. This was the first fuck up that started this rude goldberg of events that past me could not see happening. 

So as I do with any delivery, I ring home and let them know I have a delivery arriving, just to confirm someone would be there to collect them, however no one thought it'd be a good idea to tell my dad (who would be in), that my package would be coming. 

Now in my house I order pretty much everything and always put them in either of my parents names and never in my own. However this time I don't risk it and put the toys in my own. 

That night my mum decided she wanted me to order some candles that had gone on sale on amazon. So I agree to order them and I think nothing of it as they never open things with my name on it.

The next day comes around and I'm tracking both deliveries through my phone. I arrive at work and I get the first notification letting me know the box of toys had arrived, unbeknownst to me that my dad has no idea that there are more than just candles arriving. 

Now in my head, I imagine this box to be somewhat substantial in size, due to ordering a variety of items. Certainly alot bigger than one a large Yankee candle one arrive in. My dad however, decides to ignore what would be  ridiculous packaging for one candle and the fact my name is on it. I can only imagine the disgust and confusion on his face when instead of a candle, he's greeted with a butt plug, rope and vibrators. 

Meanwhile I'm still tracking the candle, perfectly happy that my things had arrived and were safe in my room. I decide to ring my dad to let him know it was just around the corner and to listen out. Needless to say this conversation seemed a bit off, especially when he said, with all the subtlety and deception of an off brand James bond, ""One arrived for you too, I didn't open it"". I didn't open it? Why would he say that? I knew there and then, but just ended the conversation normally. 

No less than 10 minutes later I get a message from my mum saying that my dad opened the box and was gob smacked. He saw things . My mum was seeing the funny side of it while I'm currently sat in work wishing I didn't exist anymore.

I've told my girlfriend who has said she is never coming over mine again out of embarrassment. I really don't blame her, if only I could do the same.

I go to this local diner relatively often. I've been going there for years and get a burger with fries. Really small and not a lot of workers. Maybe 15. I went after work the a few weeks ago and noticed a new face. She seemed nice and we had a pretty short conversation. Keep in mind this diner is kind of a do-it-yourself type thing. Refill your own drinks, etc. So the 'waitresses/waiters' really only serve your food and that's about it. So there's no real reason to tip them personally. They do have a tip jar where you order your food, but that's it. So I know she wasn't just trying to get a tip out of me. We met eyes a few times and she seemed to always fix up tables near me, often checked up on me. At first I thought it was just something she did, but I noticed she hardly gave anyone else as much attention. Maybe it's just my hopeless romantic talking.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to tonight and I decide to head over after a 12 hour shift, I was craving a burger and getting to see that waitress was a plus. Blah blah blah, I order my food, eat, finish up. But after talking to her briefly from time to time, I left her a $5 tip and on the receipt, I left my phone number. Felt a little bold. Figured the feelings were mutual. So a few hours went by, and I got a text! I was so surprised and happy. I texted her for a little bit, to later realize...it wasn't the same waitress. It was a completely different girl. Little had I known, this different waitress was giving me a few stares too from what she told me. How she always looked forward to seeing me, all the stuff you wanted to hear. Well my entire soul crushed when I found out it wasn't the one I had hoped for. And I still need to explain that there was a misunderstanding. Now I can probably never go back to that place again and not feel awkward.

tl;dr: I'm a longtime regular at a diner. Saw a cute waitress, talked to her whenever I go there, decided to leave my number on a receipt, completely different waitress whom I'm \*not\* interested in, in the slightest, texted me instead. Soul? Crushed. Awkwardness? All time high. Hotel? Trivago.

Edit: For those saying she probably gave the receipt to the other waitress, you're probably right. I have no idea how the restuarant scene works, so it's plausible. I'm assuming the other waitress just bussed my table and probably thought it was for her? Again, not sure how that whole thing works.

Well, I've been calling the building across the street from us West 6th the whole 1.5 years I've worked here. Turns out we have a second building on 6th that is further west - hence West 6th. I panic and send her an email telling her my mistake. So I leave my office again and rush to the correct building this time. Its about 1:10 pm at this point. Enter the lobby, giant fish tank, breathe a sigh of relief. Oh wait - there is no one waiting by the fish tank. I begin to start sweating again realizing I've missed her and don't know where her office is located in the building. This building is shared with another corporation so I take the elevator up to my company's reception desk figuring they can either direct me to her office or call her for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I get to reception and the desk is empty. Doesn't look like anyone has been there all day. It's 1:15pm at this point and I'm already assuming I've bombed the interview right out of the gate by being this late. I look in the first few offices to see if I can find someone to direct me to her office. Well turns out in I needed to log into an ipad kiosk they had hidden against a back wall and that would send her an email notifying her of my arrival. It's about 1:20pm by they time it gets sent off. I'm just praying for a swift death at this point and hope my nervous sweats won't be noticeable.

&amp;#x200B;

1:35pm rolls around. No one has come to collect me from the kiosk and my nervous hand sweat is starting to smudge my resumes. I figured its time to call her again as a last resort hoping I can some how salvage this shit show of an interview. I find the number for our companies operator and eventually get hooked up to her office phone number. No answer. Sweating intensifies. I leave a quick message explaining that I'm waiting in the reception area and apologizing for my lateness causing me to miss her at the fish tank. 1:45pm rolls around and I decided its time to start my slow walk of shame back to my office.

&amp;#x200B;

I get to my desk sit down and throw my hail mary email apologizing and explaining the circumstance of how this came about. I end the email with:

\&gt;I'm terribly embarrassed by my own oversight and lack of diligence to  double check the address.  I understand if you do not want to reschedule and I would like to apologize for the time that I have wasted on your's and anyone else's end.

As I'm sitting there, I open up my work calendar to see what else I need to attend/finish today and I realize my interview is actually scheduled tomorrow. I scramble through my email to see if I can redact the apology email I just sent but there is no going back. So now I have to find it within myself to hold my head up high and go to the interview tomorrow after she's received several panicked emails and 1 voicemail from me because I didn't pay close enough attention to the schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

Great news - technically I still haven't been late to an interview.

Worse news - the person who gets this position is going to be in charge of scheduling for a large research lab and the families participating in the study.

TL;DR: Thought I was late, turns out I was incredibly early. Sent out panicked emails and a voicemail before realizing my fuck up.",TIFU by not carefully reading the schedule for my interview.
413,tifu,"This really fucking sucks and I'm considering skiving the 25 minutes before break that I have with these people every day.

These people are in different year groups and I usually sit in the corner with my two year 10 friends. It was Friday and the teacher had this ""LGBT History Month (Feb 2020)"" thing up, I read it and said ""a whole other month? jeez do they need the whole year?"". This was my fuck up.

I went quiet and just let the teacher carry on and just didn't pay attention, did my homework.

I told my friend if she could move her head, because her hair was in my way. Next second, the teacher tells everyone to be quiet, and goes on about respect and stuff, I didn't listen much but I just know it was aimed at me, he pretty much hates me atm because I don't really do what I need to do in these sessions so.. yeah.

After school on my bus, my friend told me that I really upset one girl who is in the 25 minute sessions... fuck. I'm pretty sure I upset my teacher too, double fuck.

I can't take back my words and I really wish I didn't do this, I'm considering not showing up to these sessions anymore, even though I have no choice, I might as well skip it and just get detentions for not showing up. I'm afraid that they'll all be against me, I want to say sorry for what I did, it was not acceptable at all, I am a horrible person. Hate me if you want, I understand that.

414,tifu,"Obligatory this happened a few years ago, but I've been thinking about it recently and decided to share.

A few years ago I worked for a drive thru gas station named after the ever so popular felony, Hit-N-Run. It's a pretty normal convenience store but with the added benefit of a drive thru that you can utilize to get anything in the store, except for gas, brought to your car by an attendant. At the time of working there I owned an 89' Chevy S10. It was matte red, with a lovely black and red interior that had the words ""TRUCK TRUCK TRUCK TRUCK"" down the seats in a red gradient. I bought it this way and never replaced it, because I thought it was funny.

The truck itself wasn't in great condition, but the 500$ price tag and hilarious interior won me over. One particular issue I noticed with the truck was the squishy brakes. I was not a mechanically inclined person at the time, and being the procrastinator I was I allowed it to worsen, thinking i'd eventually get to it.

One day I leave work to grab some Subway(eat fresh) from down the road on break. After grabbing myself my favorite extra toasty pizza sub on italian herbs and cheese I hopped into my truck and started to return to work to eat in the annoyingly cold break room. I'm getting ready to come to a stop at the light next to our local Hardee's and my foot just slams down into the floorboard, my brake pedal offering no resistance. It finally happened. Thinking fast I swerve my truck into the grassy patch next to the Hardee's, barely missing the motorist in front of me and the fire hydrant on the curb. I fly through the grass and drop back onto the road, headed directly to the parking lot of my place of employment. The grass did a great job of slowing me down and I rolled into the parking lot expecting a parking block to be sufficient in finally bringing my truck to a stop. I was wrong. I bounced right over the little yellow thing and slammed into the back of Hit-N-Run. More specifically, the door to the car wash maintenance room.

At this point, I started panicking trying to reverse the truck over the block without going too fast. I came to the conclusion that I wasn't going to be able to move this truck without help, so I went inside and told my manager what just happened. Luckily, she wasn't mad at me, and was more so just happy I even made it back with my brakes failing. A few co workers came out and helped me stop the truck after backing out over the parking block.

tl;dr - My brakes failed because I was too lazy to get them repaired and I almost hit a car and then drove into the back of my place of work.

edit: The handbrake did not work whenever I originally bought the truck.",TIFU by ignoring my squishy brakes
415,tifu,"It was not today but on Valentine's day weekend a few years prior. I (F35) arranged a baby sitter and invited my girlfriend who lived out of town to visit for the weekend.
My gf who we'll call Jade, for ease and anonymity, has been in my life for as long as I've known my husband. He introduced us and has always accepted whatever our relationship was. Jade and I cared deeply for each other but we knew we couldn't be together full time. 
So I get fancy with this Valentine's thing and book a private booth at this swanky new night club downtown. We get there listen to some awesome Brazilian funk and drink from our bottle of Vodka that was included in the reservation I made.
Now here is where I fuck up, we were having a wonderful time and looking to Uber home and continue the party. But I didn't want to let all that ""good vodka go to waste"". I started slamming vodka and water in attempts to ""break even"" on this date's expenditures.
It didn't hit me right away. But I definitely don't remember getting into the Uber and walking into our house. I do remember coming round enough to intiate something between all parties involved before having to excuse my self to the toilet while waving them on with my hand saying, ""You two keep going, I'll be right back.""
Next thing I do remember is Jade knocking on the bathroom door checking on me. I say ""I'm fine, really! You two just carry on, I'll be back in a just a sec.

It's winter break 2015, I'm a 19 year old college sophomore spending time with family in the Toronto area. My cousin, who is 18, wants to go to see the movies and we picked Wolf of Wall Street because it looked cool and you know, Leo.

My uncle asks what our plans are and we tell him, and he proceeds to light up and say, ""That movie looks super interesting, I heard it's about finance and stock exchanges and how that all works! Can I come with you guys?"" My cousin and I think sure, why not, he bought the tickets so he might as well join us. We arrive to the theatre, get our popcorn, get some candy, and find our seats and wait for the movie to start. 

Within the first 45 seconds of the movie, Leo without any warning or hesitation, is snorting cocaine off a stripper's asshole. There are titties, drugs, and everything else you can imagine everywhere, and my cousin and I come to the realization this is not a movie about just the stock exchange and finances. My Indian immigrant uncle, who makes us turn the TV off if there is something as harmless as a kissing scene on TV, was excited and visibly happy at the start of the movie. He did not utter a word for the next 2 ish hours, but laughed at various scenes and when we looked over, he stopped right away and acted like he was in disgust. We sat through the whole thing and at the end, we got in the car and not a single word was spoken for the next 15 minutes. We pull up to the driveway and he turns to us and goes, ""Boys, Do not, under any circumstance, tell your Aunt what we saw."" We walk in like everything is normal and make a fake story about what the movie was about. To this day, no one in our family knows us three saw it together and we intend on (hopefully) keeping it that way!

TL;DR: Saw wolf of wall street with my cousin and uncle thinking it was a kosher, PG rated, family friendly movie about the stock exchange only to be terribly mistaken. Expected uncle to flip out and leave, but he enjoyed the movie while trying to not make that obvious to his 2 nephews",TIFU by watching the Wolf of Wall Street with my conservative immigrant uncle before watching the Trailer

I told the group that I used to really like Volvas back when they were boxier, but now that they're all pretty much the same aerodynamic shape it really doesn't matter to me. I got some awkward looks and a bit of a silence, so I second guessed myself and explained ""Well, I think it's the Volva. My friend had used one in college, and I liked the way it looked.""  I could tell by everyone's expression that I had just made a huge mistake. One of my coworkers was like ""it's Volvo, man"". I thought, yeah Volvo, whatever, that's what I meant.

TL;DR at the bottom 

Now for those don't vape a little info. The coil on a vape is basically what allows the vape to turn the oil into vapor. When you switch out a coil, they burn out eventually and taste like burnt milk, you have to prime it. This is done by dropping a drop or two into the coil so that it can absorb the juice and not burn your throat. You can also do it by adding juice to your tank and letting it sit for a bit. You're supposed to do both but i am an impatient person so I do the first only. 


Well I found an old vape that I haven't used in months and started taking it apart and cleaning it making sure nothing was broken. More side note my 1 year old daughter was asleep on my bed so I was being very quiet. After what seemed like hours I finally got everything unscrewed and cleaned. Months of not using the vape made everything so hard to take apart so I was getting a bit frustrated. I even got pliers to help me since everything was oily and slippery. 

Well I got everything cleaned and looking like brand new. I put the new coil into the tank and filled that bad boy with a brand new very berry minty juice. I love minty juice. Well out of my excitement I hit my vape without letting it sit for a few minutes or adding a few drops to the coil itself. To say I burnt my throat is an understatement. 

I felt like Satan himself had stuck a very hot rod down my mouth and had stabbed my throat with it. The pain wasn't even the worst part of it. It was the taste. It tastes like a  burnt strawberry and mint smoothie that was left out in the desert sun for weeks. I started coughing so bad I could barely breath and my eyes were tearing up. 

I remembered I had a cup of water by my bed so I went to grab it. Then I really fucked up. My coughing fit got worse as I walked over that my gag reflex acted up. I had just eaten some really good chilly. The taste of chilly and spoiled strawberry milk made me throw up. On my sleeping child. That was on my bed. I just got her bathed and back to sleep. Now to wash the quilts and take a shower myself.

419,tifu,"Kind of a long one. This actually took place 12 or 13 years ago. Having grew up in a somewhat rural area, hunting was a big thing that everyone did. My parents were supportive of my hobby but requested that they hold on to my guns until I needed them. Fair enough. 

One day they went out for most of the day, so I texted my buddy on my LG enV2, asking him to come up to go squirrel hunting. He agreed, and so I set off on my trek to find my hidden guns. Y’all, I checked all over this house. My mom would also hide my Christmas presents so I knew all the usual spots. Still couldn’t find them. Fuck it, I said, must be in their room. 

Sure enough, in my dads closet I found my good ol’ trusty .22 sitting in the corner. Perfect, except I had no rounds for it. Now I was a relatively tall kid but the top shelf of his closet was TALL. I was able to stick my hand up there but couldn’t see what I was grasping, I think you know where I’m going. I start feeling my hand up there and feel a hard plastic case. Aha, that’s it. I pull it down, open it up and what I find has scarred my mind ever since. 

The first thing I find is a bottle of prescription pills that I can only assume was viagra or something, I didn’t care to do any further investigation. Sitting under those pills was a stack of naked pictures of my mom in various poses. There was also some type of cloth in there, and a bottle of lube. I don’t know, at that point I was thinking about shooting myself in the head with those bullets rather than going hunting with them. Frantically, I put everything back in a neat order.. 

I then reach back in the closet of sexual horrors. Couldn’t get worse than that right? Wrong. I then pull out a MASSIVE purple dildo. I’m no dildo afficiando but this thing had to be pretty fancy for 2008. Huge, veiny, lights up, vibrates. It’s like if Barney the dinosaur had OG Mudbones cock. And the worst part, it was still sticky. I’d like to think it was just sticky cause of the material. Disgusted, I throw it across the room and it accidentally break a teacup that my mom has a plant growing in in the window sill. Great. At this point I don’t even want to go hunting, I want to wash my eyeballs with bleach. But my friend is on his way so I must carry on. FINALLY, I pull out something that isn’t from Pornhub’s Used Equipment Store. It’s my bullets. I put their box of sexual deviance back in the closet. I clean up the broken tea cup plant and dirt. I remove the artificial dick from the floor and put it back in the closet. I go hunting. I don’t get anything. Overall a shitty day 2/10 would not recommend.

Over the last several weeks I, a 26M have been dating a 21F year old, and things have been going well. We have been progressively bumping more uglies, and talked about spicing things up, just very slowly. She wanted to try a vibrator, so I ordered one for us to use. One of those remote-controlled ones at that, because it could be fun if we ever get to try rope play. Anyway, it comes in two colors, pink and blue. I’m ordering it and they are out of stock on the pink. I figure, whatever, it’s a relatively cheap one that will die and need replacing soon anyway, blue is fine right? It arrives after long shipping delay, and we are excited to use it! The deeds are done, she enjoyed it, and said we should try it again next time.

Here’s the FU.

In those last several days, my bedroom light has blown out two bulbs. It’s an old and terrible light, so I ask my landlord to replace it. I wanted to go with one of the nice bright LED lights, just out of preference. Next day, early afternoon, I get a text saying that it’s replaced. I get home many hours later, look at the new, much brighter light, and...what’s that shine from below? 

The silver silver cap of the vibrator. There’s literally no way you can’t notice the reflecting light off of it, that’s how bright it is. So my landlord now knows I have a light blue vibrator and does not know I’m seeing a woman. Now I don’t know how, or even if, I about addressing it.

I walked into the kitchen, grabbed a ramekin, and poured some soy sauce on it. I took my dongle out and plopped my man orbs inside the ramekin. It was cold as fuck, so I let it sit for a few minutes.

I'm looking like a noob as usual through the workout, but that's to be expected. When the workout was done, the coach asked us to put away our weights and bars. This is where I fuck up.

The weights are stacked vertically with a bar going through the holes to keep them neat. The stack was halfway full with weights, lmost waist height. I grab my by 15 lbs weights and start to put them through the pole, both at the same time, and let them go. Then my vision goes into an lsd like twirl. My vocal cords let loose a shriek like that of a small animal caught in a bear trap. The first weight had slid down the pole onto half of my right testicle, which was immediately followed by the second weight, 30 lbs total. Everyone fucking looked at me with a mixture of confusion and pity for an idiot, until they saw a small bit of my shorts snagged in the weights. Before they could even ask if I was okay, I freed and took back my ballsack from the weights, and ran out of there to my car with what manhood I had left.

Around the same time I realise another one of the kids has a gun aimed at me and the rest of our group. we proceed to move ourselves around the corner of the building while begging them not to shoot my friend who's getting beaten up at gunpoint by some fucking 15 year olds.

It’s not always like that, there’s still good days here and there, but she doesn’t seem to remember where I live, how old I am, and other details about me (but remembering other very random specific stuff). Last week, for the very first time since we realized that something was off and took her to doctors, I broke down and cried about my mom and how different she is compared to just even a year ago. 

The first part of what I said is true, I *do* wish she could have taken the class and I know she would have loved it. My mother was artistic, crafty, and loved trying new things. But in her state, she literally wouldn’t be able to. My mother can’t even tie her own shoes anymore. The person she used to be doesn’t exist anymore. It feels like the version of her who raised me is literally dead and replaced by a husk. On my drive home from class I felt so guilty for not correcting myself, and even more guilty because it actually felt good to say that she was dead, almost like a sense of relief. 

Now I just have to hope the ladies in my crafts class don’t ask about my mom. OR I hope I find a delicate way to back myself out of this dumb corner without seeming like a crazy person.

**TL;DR:** I told the women in my crafts class that my mother is dead instead of explaining that she has dementia and doesn’t recognize me.",TIFU by telling new acquaintances that my mother is dead

This just happened like a half hour ago.

 Ill start with, I have two roommates, a male and female couple and we all have a dog but my dog doesnt get along with their dogs so we let them equally roam the house. 

So I get off work after working a long shitty day in construction. My roommate (female) arrives home at the same time as me and starts doing her dishes while I relax in the living room and chat with some friends on my phone. An ex-girlfriend, whom I am still friends(with benefits) soon messages me knowing I'm off work and asked to video call me. I immediately know what this video call is going to entail. so I hastely retreat to my room for some privacy. I assume she didn't hear me get up and leave amidst the noise of the dishes.. so couple minutes go by... And wouldn't you know it. My bedroom door swings open so she could do the old dog switcheroo and let my dog roam the house and I'm on my bed with my pants down watching my ex on video call while she rubs one out. Now she's in her room practicing violin while she pretends to be okay. And I'm awkwardly sitting in the living room also trying to be okay.

Now for my FU.

I'm sitting in the open talking to a friend on Discord after my first class. He asks me what I'm up to and I have an online class as well on Thursdays so I said, Doing school work. I have a 5 hour FAP between classes instead of saying I have a 5 hour GAP. I proceeded to try my hardest not to giggle for a good 10-20 minutes and I still can't look at what I said without laughing.

He didn't answer for a while so I initially thought he either laughed so hard he had to leave or my 5 hour fapping killed him. Now he's proceeding to make fun of my mishap.

432,tifu,"So in the past few months I've had a couple of sleepwalking incidents. The common factors are that I'd been out drinking the night before, and that I was sleeping in not my usual bed (for example, it happened when I last visited my parents place and I was sleeping in their guest room)

Fast forward to last night. My company has an annual kickoff meeting where they fly the entire company to a common location and we all stay in the same hotel. Last night was our annual awards dinner, and I was recognized as the highest contributor within my role for my region, so obviously some celebrations were in order.

I should mention that we are quite a young company, and partying together is very much part of the culture. It's an open bar, so a few too many beers later, I stagger back to my hotel room at around 330am local time. I sleep in my underwear typically, so I stripped down and promptly passed out in my bed. Out cold. My next memory is the *DING* of the elevator doors opening to the hotel lobby. I look down, and of course, I'm only wearing my boxers. 

Let me just say, waking up to a hotel lobby, while wearing only your boxers and quite literally every room in the hotel is filled with people I work with is a feeling I will never forget. Nightmare fuel.

The adrenaline shocks me awake quickly. Luckily no one was by the elevator landing, but I needed to formulate a plan quickly. No pockets to search for the room key, so I'd need to get creative. I hit the elevator button for the fourth floor, where one of my close friends was staying and luckily the hallways were deserted. I pound on his door, hoping he could lend me a t-shirt and a phone so I could call reception, but of course last night's drinks left him in a deep slumber (deeper than mine was clearly).

I hear a door open at the end of the hall and at this point I'm panicking. I dart into a side room where the service elevator was. Decided at this point my best bet was to swallow my pride and head down to reception, hoping that I don't run into anyone before then.

No stops in the service elevator (thankfully) and I step out to a blessedly empty lobby. I waddle up to reception, sweep my hand across my body and say ""Obviously I need a bit of help here"". I give the employees credit, they were extremely professional and after a short series of questions to authenticate me they go to get a copy of my key.

It's at this point I realize I have zero idea what time it is. Theres a clock behind the reception desk, but I'm pretty short sighted and (of course) my glasses were not on me. I ask the employee, and she says ""oh just before 7am.""

Crap. Breakfast opens at 7am. This isnt good.

I ask if we could potentially speed up the process, but I could already hear the sound of people starting to grow. Mercifully, the receptionist comes out with the key, and I sprint into the service elevator.

Phew. Ok. Almost home free. 

I punch in my floor number with the speed of a Mike Tyson jab. The elevator starts to climb the floors, and I'm just hoping and praying that I get to the fifth floor with no disruption.  The elevator slowly climbs up the floors before I heard it again. The worst sound possible in this situation.

*DING*

And the elevator doors open to two women. Again, without my glasses I can't see anything, so I have zero clue who they were, but I'd love to hear the story from their perspective.

Thank goodness they did not get into the elevator. I throw another quick series of jab at the door close button while trying to push myself against the side of the elevator, out of view. The doors slowly creaaaak closed before starting its climb again. When it makes it to my floor, I cautiously stick my head out to see if my runway is clear, then sprint through the halls, throw myself at the door and get to the most serene privacy I've ever experienced.

So now, after a full day of meetings, I need to figure out who those two women were to apologize and thank them for (hopefully) their discretion.

Wont be able to look the receptionists in the eye tomorrow morning when I check out...

433,tifu,"I'm a senior and high school and I haven't eaten school breakfast since freshman year. This morning however I decided ""why not?"" and got myself some cereal from the breakfast line. I sat down at a table with my friends and everything was going great, but not for long. Everyone was getting along, I was eating some lucky charms, and all ways right with the world, till in an instant my good morning was absolutely slapped in the face and replace with a not-so-okay morning. Wheater it be by God himself's will or a slight breeze made by my hands, as I looked up from my cereal to one of my friends sitting next to me my cereal came crashing down onto my lap. I looked down at the scene of milk and cereal laying down in chaos all over my thighs. Now was I wearing shorts? No. I wasn't lucky enough. If I hade it would have been fine I could have simply cleaned it off with soap, water, and some paper towels and been on with my day, but no I was wearing pants. I sat there for a moment in shock and absolute disbelief as I contemplated this in my head, as the milk soaked into my jean creating a feeling of discomfort, to say the least. I stood before the milk that had gotten onto my seat could get too friendly with my butt. My friend next to me was frantically trying to clean to mess of milk left on my seat and the table as I looked at the scene in awe. One of my other friends at the table asked if I was okay which I replied ""You know what, I'm not even mad. I'm just surprised this didn't happen to me sooner."" It dawned on me exactly why this was. I had stopped eating school breakfast so there was much less of a chance of this ever happening to me, which made me laugh a little, as I realized the one time I eat school breakfast again this happened lol. I promptly walked myself and my milk painting jeans to the nurse's office where I got some pants to borrow and all was right again, but now I have learned a valuable lesson. I shouldn't even bother trying to eat the stale school breakfast again. It was NOT worth it, but hey it made for a funny story of me being an absolute clumsy idiot lol. I didn't even touch it when it fell, so I don't even know how I managed this one.

434,tifu,"Okay, so this story begins with me trying to build my own Elgato Chat link (cable that allows me to use headphones and still get audio to the Elgato capture card) for livestreaming. This required me to go purchase a 3.5 mm Auxillary splitter, and a long Auxillary cable, so I did just that. Problem is, when I got back home I realized that the 3.5 mm male plugin is the wrong kind for what I needed (cable has 2 rings on plug, I need 3 rings) and the nearest Best buy is a 15 minute drive one way. Frustrated at the situation and not wanting to go back out, I pulled out my phone to ""De-stress"". Big Mistake. Upon beating my meat, in what seems like a freak accident of precision and bad timing, my load shoots directly into the headphone jack of my phone, and I IMMEDIATELY lose audio. Hoping it was just the video, I go to YouTube and check out the first thing I can click on... Nope. It's because I jizzed in my audio jack. This caused my phone to force itself into headphone mode and at the time of writing this, despite cleaning the jack with a stripped Q-tip in hopes of absorbing the fluid, I still cannot get speaker audio on my phone. Suggestions are appreciated!

TL;DR: I was stressed, watched porn on my phone, accidentally came in the audio jack, and now my speakers don't work.

In middle school they allowed us to wear our singlets if we were uncomfortable weighing in the nude in front of the coaches. So I went to put mine on. My singlet was matte black. I pulled it out and started to put on the spandex. But it wasn’t going on right. I pulled it over my shoulders and my teammate/bully said, “wtf is that?”

I decided to commission them some art. The artist I went to was also in our guild. I pitched him my idea and asked him if he would be interested in doing it. I also asked him how much it would cost. 

He told me he doesn't really know how to price his art, so it's on the house. But I insisted that he was going to get something for his time and work. He agreed and said we could discuss the price once it was finished. 


This was where I fucked up. I thought since he originally was going to do it for free, that I would just give him $20 or $30 bucks.

Well, the good news is the art is amazing! He really put a lot of time and effort into it. It did take a lot longer than I would have liked, but he apologized for that a couple times. And I already told my Secret Santa that it would be late, so I wasn't too concerned about it.

The bad news is I was not expecting him to charge me $210!! I understand that artists need to be paid for their hard work and time. And the artwork looks really good. But I was definitely under the impression that it would be much cheaper since he originally wanted to offer it for free.

It's summer break. My dad is home with my twin and me and we want to watch some historical movies. We decide to watch some Clint Eastwood because why not, and we had never watched *Letters From Iwo Jima* until that point. My dad says sure and we plug it in.

Spoiler alert; it's really raw and depressing. My twin and I are half Japanese so seeing the Japanese side of that battle was really heart-wrenching. I say, ""Let's watch an animated movie next... something more cheerful."" Everyone agrees. Here's the fuckup.

I plug in *Grave Of The Fireflies*. If you've never seen it, it's a fantastic film by Isao Takahata (friend and fellow artist of Hayai Miyazaki) about two children who are left orphaned after American air raids on Japanese soil. It follows their trials and tribulations through their survival. It's also really, REALLY sad. We all cried.

So the movie is over. We are crying and hoping that the depress-fest is over. Dad, tears in his eyes, looks over to the tv and then to us and says,

""Someone please plug in *My Neighbor Totoro*.""

There is a hot sauce crisis  where I’m at. We occasionally get a knock off bottle of crap (read Texas Pete sriracha style ketchup). We’ve all been suffering I tell you.  
I found a bottle of real Sriracha in a random care package yesterday.  Full size delicious, slightly spicy garlicky Sriracha.  I’ve been the envy of the whole shop ever since.  I finally took it with me to dinner tonight.  I was a hero.   We passed it around and dumped it on everything.  We laughed, we ate, it was wonderful.  

I was understandably in a good mood at this point, walking home, whistling, diddy bopping If you will.  As I was walking I decided to throw my bottle into the air and catch it.  It seemed jaunty and carefree, a good idea all around.  I went to throw it, then I thought “Maritimesadness! you idiot!  What if it’s open??”  So.  I twisted it tight, and threw it into the air.  It flipped, 5 maybe 6 times in the air.  It was Majestic.  As it came back within reach I snagged it perfectly out of the air.  It was perfect.  As I caught it with the tip pointed at me, I caught the spiciest blast of garlicky hell in my eyes and all over my face.  

It turns out, this bottle doesn’t close at all.  No matter how tight you twist it.  Now my clothes are in the wash and I’m constantly flushing my eyes.  It’ll stop burning soon right??

439,tifu,"This did not happen today but some years ago when I was still a student. I was (and still am) a huge nerd wearing mostly black T-Shirts with more or less nerdy prints.

I was studying computer science, had a side job as a programmer and also, as an organist, played the occasional funeral. As a student, occasional became rather frequent because funerals usually happen at times most other people work - so the only organists available for such occasions are those who either work full time as an organist or those who do not work their main job full time.

It was the beginning of summer, outside temperatures already rather high, but inside of old churches it was still a little bit cold. During that time I played a funeral almost every week and I would usually do it between other things. Once I first went to work for two hours, travelled to the church, played the service, travelled to University and attended an evening lecture. The story happens at the beginning of summer, outside temperatures already rather high, but inside of old churches still a little bit cold. So I am on my way to yet another funeral, got dressed on autopilot, grabbed my notes and a cardigan because although we had 30°C outside, inside the church it still would be quite fresh.

I arrive at the village, get out of the train and just have to walk another five minutes to the church. From far away I can already see that there are already like 50 people standing outside the church.

Then it hit me. I got dressed on autopilot and the Shirt I wore had a huge ""Sh\*t happens"" print. Walking through the crowd with that print? No way.

So I had a choice - either wearing the shirt inside out (and looking like an idiot who can't dress himself) or wearing the cardigan over the shirt (and looking like an idiot who wears a cardigan in blazing).

I decided in favour of the cardigan and it was awful, when I arrived at the church I was sweating like a pig. Luckily, I could slip out unnoticed after the service so I did not have to walk back wearing the cardigan again.

440,tifu,"So this actually happened this last weekend. I had a 2006 tundra and I had just built out the back for camping (platforms, shells, drawers, insulation,  etc.) So 3 friends and I took a trip to Jackson WY from Denver to ski/board for the weekend. We decided on ultimately just getting a hostel but it was still nice to have the space for all out gear in the back. 

On the way home, one friend (we will call him Jeff) offered to drive. I agreed and off we went. The roads were pretty sketch in the beginning but got through just fine. Made it to I80 and the roads looked like they cleared up and was relatively not windy. About 20 miles west of rawlins there was a car slowing down and putting on hazards in the right lane. So, 'Jeff' got in the left lane, passed him, then while getting back in the right lane started fish tailing. Started heading for the ditch and then in slow motion I remember the car started turning on its side. Then, next thing I know I'm hanging in my seat belt. The truck first rolled on the passenger side then flipped and landed on the drive side.

Miraculously everyone was okay. My friends got out through the sunroof, I stayed back to find my shoes and then thing I hear a loud crash and a jolt in the car. Luckily I didn't take off my seatbelt yet because a semi truck clipped the corner of the truck. He didnt even stop just kept going. Luckily again I was fine. 

The cops got there pretty quickly and once the tow truck got the truck we gathered our gathered our things and went to a hotel. Called a buddy and he drove out to get us. 

Car is totaled and no I have to search for a new truck. 'Jeff' is going to help pay for expenses of getting a new car (registration, costs of traveling to places, topper, materials for the back, etc) which is awesome of him.

441,tifu,"Heyo. This happened yesterday so please forgive me for the T in the TIFU.

A bit of backstory, I usually sleep in the day and then i'm up and about in the night. Recently this has reversed and so now i'm on a normal sleep schedule. That's gonna change me thinks after yesterday's events. 

I wake up early and head to town. I recently bought an MP3 Player cause my phone is awful. I fill it with some good tunes and off I go.

I'm walking towards town and my earphones fallout. I put em back in. A minute later, they fall out again. This kept on happening all day and I could feel myself getting more and more pissed off with it everytime it happened.

I get to town and I walk towards the opticians, my glasses have been wonky for ages and so I decide to try to get them fixed. I'm walking towards the door and I trip over the sidewalk. My glasses and their case, go flying the air and ironically, break apart on impact with, you guessed it, the opticians' door. I pick them up and decide, maybe just buy a new pair someday else. So i'm walking through town and mp3 player is still playing, and the next song comes on, is a little quiet. So it i turn up quite a lot and continue to walk. My earphones fall out, again. I angrily put them back in, maybe slightly too in and continue to walk.

As i'm walking, I see guys handing out something and so I try to avoid them, but they seem me and come over. They're Mormons.   They hand me a little bit of paper and begin talking to me. I could hear them just about, as my music's quite loud, however not massively loud and luckily, the song seems to be ending. 

I'm standing listening and then the next song comes on. 

It's the Doctor Who theme song from 2008. It was so loud. Like so fucking loud! If everyone knows that theme, you know it's already loud on a normal volume.

Since it's so loud and sudden I shout ""ouH FUCKING JESUS CHRIST!"" and my pull my earphones out of ears.

For just a moment, I thought i'd gone def but no, the town was just silent. I realized I must of said it really, really loud and then the Mormon snatches the little paper thing he gave me. So great, even Jesus hates me now.

I quickly walk off and go to put my earphones back in but somehow, I've broken them. They just don't work. I don't know how or why they broke but I think, they're only cheapo ones, i'll get some new ones.

I then change where I'm going and head to nearest shop that sells em. It was Argos, which is basically a shop where there's a catalog,  and you pick what you want and see if it's in stock. If it is, you get it straight away, if not, usually they deliver it the same day to the store upon request, which I always thought was really cool.

I go in and select some headphones that I think okay (fuck earphones at this point) and luckily for me, they were in stock. So I put them in the cart on the computer and go to buy them, i put my card against the scanner and... nothing happens. I'm like 'wtf' and so I pay slightly more attention and do it again. It works. I then realize that the next catalog next to me printed a receipt. I had accidentally put my card againist the scanner next to it. 

Fuck.
I look at the reciept for the one I didn't mean to use and it say it's a electric saw that i had accidently bought. I thought no worrries really, just get a refund and all that, it'll fine.

I go over and 10 minutes later, the saw arrives. They call my number and I stand up. She gives mes a look and says 'ID Please' and I explain that I didn't mean to buy it.

She insists that I need ID. I say don't worry, i'm not taking it home. I just want a refund.
She calls her manger over and I explain what happened. I then see my headphones on the desk and my other number gets called I say that's mine one and the manger basically says we'll let it slide since it was clearly a mistake.

The manger goes  away and I pick my headphones, the guy, who wasn't really in earshot of my conversation with his manager and fellow worker. He says can I have your number please and I was like 'huh?' and he said, the receipt for this product, you need it to confirm you bought it.  I had forgot to pick up the original receipt.

Double fuck.
I ran over the machine I was on previously and there was a lady with a small child on the machine. I looked for the receipt on the table and i see shes got in her hand, I say to her 'ouh, that's er mine' and she says 'i'm gonna hand it in to the desk to see if any claims it."" I was like yeah, it's mine.

After a heated discussion I prove to her it's mine by showing her my card and showing her the 4 last digits are same as the ones on the receipt. She subsides and gives it to me, I run over to the desk and go to give the guy the receipt. A older gentleman behind me says I pushed in but I say i will literally a minute and plus his number hadn't come up yet.

I could literally see the box for the headphones  on the shelf behind the desk. I show the guy the receipt, he goes to get it and gives it me. I finally walk out of the shop with my shiny new headphones.

I go and sit down a bench and setup my new headphones, I open them up and realize that I'd fucked up again. I bought wireless, bluetooth headphones, that clearly won't work with an mp3 player.

Triple fuck.
I put em in my bag and decide to walk to cex, which is a shop that buys and sells things.
I go in and goes surprisingly smoothly, i already have a membership thing so no need to sign up and thus made a whooping... 24 pounds. Woo.

I walk out and just as the day is looking up  for me, I go past a greggs and decide to nip in. After having the issues with card I described, I decided to just cash. I bought a one pound snack and walked out, leaving 23 pounds in cash on me

I was fumbling around with my wallet and dropped it. I go to pick it up and I see a two pound coin roll out of my wallet and go straight into a grate. I now have 21 pounds on.

Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

I am pissed off beyond repair and decide to say fuck it and go to a local arcade. I walk in and a security guy says no outside food.

So i angrily eat my snack I bought from greggs and really didn't enjoy it as i quickly eat it and not savoir it.

I enter the arcade and it's dead pretty much.

I go to the desk and give him the twenty pound note from cex and say can you change it into 5s for me. I clearly meant 5 pound notes.

I stand there for ages and hes comes back with fucking like LOADS of tiny bags full of 5 p coins.


fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckity fuck.

He then gets a phone call and i'm just looking at these bags full of 5ps. 
I pick em all up and stuff em into my bag.

I then walk home with a pound in my wallet, an unsure amount of money in my bank and a shit ton of 5ps.

My friend and I made it back to the port with about 5 minutes to spare but that wasn't enough time to make it through customs and back to the ship. Of the two of us, I had more to drink. Therefore I was the one who had the genius idea to hop the fence and make a dash for the ship. Well the customs officials had a different view on how good an idea that was. The two of us hopped the fence and immediately got busted. The ensuing police debacle not only got us in trouble, but held up the entire cruise ship. The Captain came down onshore and scolded us before firing us on the spot. When you're fired off a cruise ship... You're fired. There and then.

I was hungry and hadn't had breakfast, and while in the walk-in fridge, spied a large bag of thick, round cut turkey breast.

The perfect crime, I thought. I could have a piece of turkey in my mouth and down my gullet before anyone who would care could see me. As a small-framed, 5'3"" or so female, my hunger is much larger than I am. I grabbed the roughly one inch thick, bowl sized piece of turkey, and jammed it into my mouth with the ferocity of a starving bear.

Business as usual. I've chewed before, you might even call me an expert. This hamster-pouch of turkey is no match for me. Oh, the hubris.

Attempting to swallow this giant piece of the world's driest meat, it lodges tightly halfway down my throat.

Fuck.

Well, no big deal. I can still breathe, so this turkey is going down whether it wants to or not. A few aggressive swallows later, and I've made no progress. At this point the gag reflex kicks in.

""They really had us in the first quarter,"" I can practically hear the turkey tell the reporter.

""But we knew she'd choke.""

I did. I started hacking and heaving like I'm about to loose a furball. This poultry adam's apple is not going anywhere. I start rushing to the bathroom, expecting to vomit, where I smash the bathroom door open, and barrel past (through) my front house manager. Sorry you have to be here for this, Emily. But the battle of the century waits for no hand-washing.

I make it to a stall, and by this point, the turkey has won. I hack and sputter and vomit a little, and am finally free of this hunk of devil-bird. I left the stall, convinced my horrified coworker that I didn't have the flu (which would have resulted in me being shamefully sent home), and returned to work.

Tl;dr: Like Icarus, I flew too close to the proverbial sun, and nearly choked on a too-big bite of satan's turkey.",TIFU by deepthroating poultry
445,tifu,"A trip to a fancy cinema...

So I’ve been seeing this French girl, she’s an actor and she loves movies. I decided I’d bring her to the nicest cinema I could find, trying to impress her of course. I found one that fit the bill, it had leather armchairs, table service etc. I booked tickets when I was having a couple of beers one night, I was delighted cus they were the last two left in the cinema, we were up the front but I was happy anyway. 

Fast forward to the date, I picked her up in my car that I’d just got a license for, so of course I cut out 3/4 times before we got to the cinema. Totally botched the parallel park attempt, and just left it three quarters way in. Anyway, we get there and walk in, the place is packed and we’re walking towards our seats. As I’m getting closer I notice there’s people sitting where we should be...but they’re not, as I peer over their heads I see a row of beds, oh no, A FUCKING ROW OF BEDS. On our second date I booked a bed. Her face contorted with pure, French disgust when I explained they were our seats. I’ve never felt further away from someone while lying in a bed, it may have been a meter but it may as well have been a mile.

446,tifu,"This literally happened like 20 minutes ago. My cat sleeps in my room at night because the other animals in the house like to harass her, and also because she is on a special diet so she has to eat separate from them. However, her special diet food smells absolutely nasty, and it stinks up my room.

I started keeping a collection of candles, so that I can light one when she eats so that my room doesn't smell so bad. Today I went to light one, and I grabbed my box of matches from my dresser.

Side note, I use matches simply because I like them better than lighters. Sometimes I have trouble lighting them, and I'm not a smoker so I don't just have any around. Plus matches just seem cooler to me, though I might have to rethink what brand I use from now on.

I struck the match on the side of the box and it lit instantly, but in the same moment it also broke in half. I was probably a little too rough on the strike. My reflex reaction was to catch the burning match so that it didn't fall on my carpeted floor, so I closed my hand around it, resulting in a minor (but still painful) burn to my finger.

Again, in a reflex reaction, I dropped the still-burning match because OW MY HAND'S ON FIRE and it landed on the carpet and then the carpet started catching fire. I stared at it like an idiot for about 5 seconds before realizing what was happening and quick patted it out.

Unfortunately it doesn't stop there. I still live at home with my mom because I'm a broke college student, and she has to wake up for work much earlier than I do, so I have to be really quiet after 10 PM as she is an extremely light sleeper. This fiasco all went down in my bedroom in the ""basement"", and she sleeps upstairs on the first floor.

Our first floor is also where we keep all the medicine stuff, though. I went upstairs, trying to be quiet to hound around for some Aquaphor, and managed to drop my phone into the dog's food bowl and wake my mom up, who wanted to know wtf I was doing. I told her, and she scolded me like the dumb child I must obviously still seem like. Guess that's what I deserve. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

447,tifu,"Throw away for obvious reasons.  I recently reconnected with my high school girlfriend.  We are both married now but found out we still had feelings for each other.  I'm in California and she is now in Texas, but we started chatting via internet and it got real sexual real fast.  We finally decided to meet and see where things might go.  Las Vegas was the site chosen, but she would not be able to go without some reason to give her husband, so she decided to tell him that she wanted a girls trip with her daughter.  Her daughter is a stripper in their hometown and still lives at home.  

So the trip is set and we meet.  Within 1 hour we are banging hard and fast.  For 2 days all we did was fuck and eat.  Daughter was staying in the room with us but was totally chill and gave us our space.  However, my ex-G/F decides she wants to make a sex vid and says her daughter would totally be down to film us.  I was a bit weirded out at first but just decided ""what the hell"".

So there we are, mom is sitting on my face and daughter is filming.  When I suddenly felt daughter touching my dick.  I first thought it was mom but then realized that it wasn't possible for her in her current position.  I move mom to the side to verify what was going on thinking mom might get pissed at daughter, but no, moms says its cool with her if i'm OK with it.  So there we are, mom on my face and daughter stroking my dick and eventually starts sucking it.  My very first threesome in my 42 years of life and its a mom/daughter team.  Mom even let me fuck her daughter.   Actually lined my dick up for insertion.  They never touched each other, but we were all naked.  

Here is where the FU happened.  I assumed the daughter was about 18 or 19 y/o which would put her birth well after mom and I parted ways.  But on the way to the airport, it is revealed that she is 24 y/o.  I quickly start doing math and realized that daughter is definitely in the zone of me being her actual father.  I didn't say anything at the time cause I was trying to convince myself that I'm bad at math.  

I contact her a few days later and I'm freaking the fuck out on her, telling her how she could allow this to happen.  She steadfastly states that her daughter was absolutely not mine.  Says she had her period on the drive to Texas after we broke up.  Even remembers having to ask a stranger at a roadside rest for tampons.  I'm trying to allow myself to believe this but in the back of my mind, I'm convinced I fucked my daughter.

448,tifu,"So I used to work at this engineering firm on Saturdays through college just doing bits around the factory, sweeping up, cutting steel etc, and i used to get a lift off one of the labourers who worked there.

This one Saturday I was told that my lift was going to be working off-site, but would be back about an hour after I was originally meant to finish work to take me home and that I should wait in the factory until he gets here. All is well and I'm just sat on my phone passing the time when I look up and see the company forklift parked up between some on-going work and the works van (I had always really wanted to have a go in the forklift but not having a license meant that the place I worked wouldn't let me anywhere near it.). I knew that the keys were left in the forklift at all times and although I tried my best to refrain from getting on and having a go, minutes past, my will power waned, and eventually I said fuck it. Hopped on, and started it up.

Now my original idea was to have a quick back and forth go to get it out my system, no harm done. Well once I'd done that I got a bit more confident, pulled it out the makeshift parking space and started driving around the whole factory. Now this forklift was surprisingly fast and I didn't hold back, I started doing doughnuts and made myself an imaginary race track in my head. After realising that the 5 minutes of doughnuts had started to take off the paint of the factory's floor, I drive the forklift back to put it where I found it, so everyone would be none the wiser.

As I'm driving into this spot I made sure that the front was nicely lined up, forgetting that the rear of the forklift was a good half a foot wider on each side. I drive the forklift straight into this gap and hear this awful metal on metal scrape and see the van next to me basically half lift up off the ground. My arse literally fell out after hearing this sound and I reversed out and jumped straight off to assess the damage. Now the side I hit was all caved in and I had took most of the paintwork off so it was fucked up pretty bad. In the time I had left before my lift arrived I was searching panel repairs on vans from local mechanics and realised it was way more than what I could afford so I accepted my fate, parked it up and sat there waiting for my lift so I could tell him what I'd done.

My lift arrives and is literally crying laughing at my pale white face and the whole situation that I had just explained to him and offers little help to what the fuck I was supposed to tell my boss. I ring my boss and he tells me he'd speak to me the following week where I received a fairly large bollocking as expected and I went straight to a final warning for anything in the future.

449,tifu,"Literally just happened. I feel so gross. So gross and so unclean.

Anyway, I've been trying to sleep for the last hour or two. I'm having trouble sleeping, nothing out of the ordinary. I roll from one side to another and I feel a pinch.

Probably just an aggressive flip, something got caught, whatever. No big deal. An uneventful twenty-thirty minutes pass.

Then I feel it. Something horrific. Like a solid mass moving into my ear canal. I can feel the roughness, that gritty texture. I think it's a maggot and my brain is in overdrive. ""What's happening? Why me? Please be a dream?"" Obviously, none of those first thoughts were, ""Do something!""

I, then, immediately jump out bed, brushing away at my ear in a downward motion. I can feel less of it on each swipe. It's happening. It's going in my ear further. What do I do? I furiously bang the side of my head, like trying to get water out, but to no avail. I'm desperate now. I take my little finger up to the top of my ear canal and press down and away. I can feel the carapace give and the entrails spill out.

It's still in my ear. But at least it's no longer moving. After a couple more attempts, it falls out onto my floor. I spit in disgust. Not sure if that was directed at myself, the bug, or the way I handled it.

So yeah. Been cleaning my ear out and looking up articles about earwigs actually going in a person's ear. Turns out, if I was asleep, little bug would have noped out of there on its own accord. Now I just feel gross and bad for the bug.

But I was awake. Just like the last 20 hours. And now I can't sleep. 11/10 night. Would do again /s

As soon as I overtook him, he started accelerating and flashing his headlights. So I slowed down and let him catch up. When he was alongside he pointed first at me and then to the road in front of him and he started flashing his headlights again. I thought he was counting down for a drag race, I nod to him and at the third flash I took off full throttle. Needless to say, I won.

It took me atleast 3 more people signaling at me before I noticed there wasn't much of a light beam in front of my bike (city lights were still working, so there was some light). Ended up driving an hour without headlights, luckily I didn't run into any cops.

452,tifu,"There is a tl;dr at the bottom of the post.

I headed off to work today like on any other weekday. I got close to work and started looking for parking. The closest spot was about two blocks away. So I parked my car, which was close to a curb, now I would say way too close. On the curb was a large bush with pretty pink flowers. This is where I F'd up. But I didn't quite realise it just then. 

So after I had gotten out my car, I had to squeeze past my vehicle and the bush. The branches and leaves of the bush were brushing against me and my clothes but I didn't think anything of it.

I walked the two blocks and made my way into work. After sitting down, I opened up my laptop and felt something on my arm. I couldn't see anything but decided to take a closer look and there was a tiny bug on my arm, which was okay, I just flicked it off and carried on setting up my laptop. 

A few moments later my skin was feeling a bit weird. So I took a closer look at my arms again and realised that they were covered in these tiny little bugs, I took a look at my clothes and they were all over them too. I was covered in aphids from the bush I had parked next to.

It felt nightmarish. I immediately got up and left work. I ran to my car. My skin crawling, I had to brush past the bush that was infested with aphids again. I eventually got into my car and the waterworks started - fending off a panic attack, I just on breathing and cried all the way home. 

It was awful. You couldn't see the bugs unless you were looking closely. So driving home was so sickening to me because I could feel these things crawling on me, but I couldn't see them.

My entire body, trying to defend itself against this feeling... started sweating profusely. I even had beads of sweat running down the palms of my hands. By the time I got home, my clothes were sopping wet. I was absolutely drenched from all the literal sweat and tears. I immediately unclothed and jumped in the shower. Washing everything over and over and over again.

This might not sound bad to some... but, oh my soul, the feeling was absolute nightmare fuel. 

Eventually, I headed back to work - finding parking faaar from any sort of vegetation. No more parking next to any greenery for me!

453,tifu,"TIFU because I was dog sitting for my boyfriends family. My boyfriend is currently at basic training until February. I haven’t seen him since December so naturally I missed him. I found his Apple Watch and decided to scroll through his music selections and add some of his songs to my phone so I could listen to them and think of him. However since his phone hasn’t been on and his watch hasn’t been on it naturally connected to Wifi and proceed to spam me with all of his messages since he’s been inactive. I was naturally curious since he would never let me on his phone. Then I saw it. Messages from a girl he swore he only talked to in a groupchat on Snapchat. A group of all the people going to basic training together. Now him talking to her didn’t bother me. Infact I encouraged him to be friends with her but he went on a tangent about how he didn’t really like her and he didn’t want to talk to her outside of the groupchat because she’s boring and her boyfriend gets jealous of any guys she talks to. I said okay then that’s fine. So I find out he’s been talking to her on messages no problem that he’s talking to her, just that he lied about it. So since he lied I decided to check it out. Starts out innocent enough, him comforting her because she’s at a funeral. Cute, how nice of him looking out for other people. Skip to messages a week later. Them confessing their attraction to each other because “no one understands us and our decision to go into the military and no one is being supportive”.

There is a big traditional church there that never gets any mail. It doesn't even have a slot on the frame for mail, and in all my time covering the duty, its never once had a letter. Until today.

I pulled up and looked for a letter box of some sort but couldn't see any. Not a problem, I'll just see if the front door is open.

It was so I went right through intending to just leave the letter on a table just inside or whatever worked.

The entrance opens up halfway along where all the seating is, and unbeknown to me as I walked in, a funeral was taking place. Everyone turned and looked at me, looking annoyed initially that someone would turn up this late, and then seeing it was a postman in a bright orange fluorescent jacket, their expressions turned to confusion. The vicar managed to carry on whatever he was saying like a pro so fortunately it didn't go completely silent.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago i was browsing a semi-popular sub for people interested in sartorialism, suits all that sort of thing, i met a person there who's really nice and into the same style as me, so we've talked quite a bit and probably progressed to friendship, in one of his posts about a suit he was wearing this shirt that looked amazing, i asked him about it and he told me what style it was, i was like ""cool, want one for myself""

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the previous coat incident i didn't want to ask my parents directly or buy the shirt myself, i met some very nice people on relationship advice who told me to just go ahead or buy it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, something amazing happened, my sister lives in a really dandy part of the country and i was talking about the shirt and she said ""could probably find one of them in a vintage shop here"" i was like ""sure, i'd appreciate it"" i also asked about the coat too, and she said yea probably can find one of them too and mail it down to me.

Then today came around, my sister was on the phone to my brother and asked about my size (even though i'd told her an estimate) and then mentioned a message i had sent her a few nights ago, stating that i'd appreciate the coat as my parents weren't allowing me to own one.

This was read out to my mother, i was told off for lying, and asking my sister, had a lecture about how my sister is poor and can barely afford to look after her children let alone buy clothes for me (her kids, by the way, are spoilt, and are like getting brand new toys and tablet pc's every few months) and all that.

So I was like 9 at the time, and there was a big conference that many people from the church I grew up in were going to. You had to be 13 to attend, and it was 4 days long. Most people attending stayed at a hotel next door to the conference. 
Since I wasn’t old enough to attend, and neither were many of my friends, the parents arranged for a lot of us to stay at one house and be babysat by a few older girls in our church. There were about 15-20 kids in total in this house, most under age 13, but none younger than about 5. So you can imagine an army of elementary aged kids with a couple of 20-ish year old girls trying to keep us alive. 

Well the other kids and I had the idea to go out into the back yard to play “horse”. 
I, being the bright kid I was, told all the other kids to eat the lawn. I convinced them after taking a few big monches of grass and showing them it was harmless... or so I thought. 
Excited to be “real horses”, soon there was a yard full of kids crawling around chomping on the grass. 

About an hour later when we all came inside to watch a movie, it began. 
One kid after another just started vomiting everywhere. Some were lucky enough to make it to the bathroom. Many weren’t. The first kid puked on one of our babysitters, so she was busy trying to clean herself up, while the other babysitter was dealing with the rest of the poor kids who followed my lead who thought it was a great idea to eat a (probably freshly fertilized) lawn.

I bought an SSD during my semester break so I was excited to use it on my home computer. I cloned my boot disk and that didn't exactly work so I had the bright idea to use a recovery USB to try and ""recover"" my OS on the SSD.

I found it strange when the PC didn't ask which disk I wanted to recover on so that was when I started internally screaming. Turning it off probably would've toasted my HDD so I let the ""recovery"" run.

458,tifu,"This fuck up started a few days ago and came to fruition today.

A bit of information for context: I’m a teacher and it’s the end of the semester, so I’m super busy. My cat (her name is Chicken) is also good about regulating her diet and not gorging herself, so I can usually just dump a bunch of food in her bowl every once in a while and let her be.

So, a few days ago I was making a tuna sandwich. Like most cats, as soon as the top came off the can, Chicken is there screaming at me like a banshee wanting to share my fish. Normally I drain the tuna juice into a small bowl and let her lap it up, but I noticed she has this big honkin’ bowl of dry food she hasn’t eaten. She’s been becoming increasingly picky due to all the fancy wet food and treats I give her, so I had the brilliant idea to drain the tuna juice over her dry food to give her a treat, but also to encourage her to eat what she’s got. Smart, right? She starts happily chompin’ and I eat my sandwich and that’s that.

Over the next few days I was in and out of the house, only home for brief periods of time. I always glanced at her bowl and saw food in it, and she ran around and meowed at me like she do; she’s always been a talkative cat. I’ll admit, maybe I didn’t pay as much attention to her as I should have.

Fast forward to today: finished all my grading, go to happy hour with coworkers, and come home. Chicken is practically howling at me as soon as I walk in the door, climbing up my leg, screaming at me, then screaming at her STILL FULL food bowl. I have a semi-drunken argument with Chicken about how she needs to be a good cat and finish the food she’s got. She is angry. She will not. She is a bad cat. I give in.

As I go to dump her food bowl and get fresh food for the princess, the full bowl of kibble drops out as ONE SOLID PIECE. It seems all the tuna juice seeped down through the overfilled bowl of food to the bottom of the dish, molded, then grew up through the entire bowl, rendering it inedible. She must have been trying to tell me for days, and I’m a bad kitty owner. I gave her heaps of wet food and many pets in penance, but I think she’s still mad at me.

Sorry Chicken.

So obligatory this happened roughly 7 years ago... 

I was renting a house with three friends, the property was a new build terrace of three. The other two were set up as flats and had a joint entrance hallway that separated our house and led to a communal garden.

This was the only entrance to said garden for the top floor flats... My friend was over, played some guitar hero and left to go do what ever (mid afternoon) I took him through the communal hall thing to get his bike - cream carpets in a rental fuck bring the bike though the house.

So I’m not wearing shoes and got out our front door and follow him through the hall to lock the door after he has the bike through. I’d given him the key to go ahead as he knew the drill.

Now my friend can sometimes be a bit of a cool customer and by that I mean socially awkward as fuck. Turns out he didn’t unlock the door, it was already open... as he went out, there was a neighbour hanging washing to the side out of my line of sight. She waves to him, it turns out as he made no reaction, came back through and I locked the door.

So I blissfully unaware lock the door and go up stairs to the loft room and hit the shit out of my drum kit for like 90 minutes. Then played some BF3 head phones blazzing.

This poor women had been banging on my back downstairs window for over 2 hours before I went downstairs for a piss and heard... worse still my house mate came in just as I was walking down the stairs and they heard the banging first and opened the door. I heard the conversation from the toilet. Poor women was vexed, kept asking what she had done to piss us off, she (rightfully) couldn’t understand how my friend didn’t mention she was in the garden, he had been over so many times she had thought he lived with us. She thought he’d blanked her before locking her out. I over heard she thought I was drumming to drown out her screams 🤣🤣🤣 That made me laugh and die inside with cringe

So fucking cringe.

I bought a big bunch of flowers and explained as best I could that my mate is a plank and hadn’t made any indication there was someone in the garden. But also that I was an idiot for not checking. 

TL:DR locked someone outside

PS: Really also on reflection what a tool she was for unlocking a communal door and making effort to leave the key inside her flat afterwards, that mistake takes a high level of inefficiency

So when I placed my order of a spicy chicken fajita, with a side of jalapeno poppers and a salad, nothing really registered especially since the pictures in the menu were slightly misleading, IIMO.

To make matters worse, I was seated fairly close to the window, so pedestrians walking by were treated to a poor, frazzled, apologetic server desperately trying to squeeze my entire order on my table, despite it being obvious all of it was not going to fit, all in front of one obese, pasty white American man. I recognized at least two said pedestrians and distinctly remember someone taking a picture with their phone.

Worse still was my having no idea how to eat the fajita (the tortillas served with the meal threw me off) and I waited until the couple seated near me started on theirs.

I was close to dying of shame by this point, so I quickly inhaled the refried beans, chicken, poppers, and most of the salad, before leaving a twenty dollar tip and paying my $25 bill. despite probably only eating ten, maybe fifteen dollars of it.

I can't stop there again. Ever.

461,tifu,"So, this was a couple of years ago. The tifu about the mothers kindle made me (unfortunately) recall this.
- I was staying at some friends' house for a couple of days. (different city, a few hundred km away from my home village)
They're a married couple about my age and have two spare rooms in their house. One, they let me stay in, the other was occupied by the mother of one of them. She is a super nice lady, in her late 60s or early 70s. She is also very poor hearing. 
Anyway, I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and I hear coming from the mother's bedroom the unmistakable sound of porn and, shall we say, vigorous masturbation.
I quietly backed up to my room and just held my pee until morning.
I've not told my friend about this, even though it's been a few years. I don't think that's something they would even want to know. This is literally the first time I've told anyone about, hoping the anonymity will ensure it never gets back to my friends.

Yesterday my mom was cooking dinner and decided to microwave a potato for herself. The thing that we normally would use to cook a potato was in the washing machine though. She decides that it would be fine to put it in the microwave without the cooker and proceeds to do it. After she put it in, she walked outside for a a minute or so to go talk to my dad. She walked back in and there was a ton of smoke and she was wondering what was wrong. She checked the microwave and —what do you know—a burning potato! Fire and the like, she frantically tries to pour water over it and it goes out. I came out of my room to see what the commotion was about and all I see is my mom standing there in embarrassment with a charred, black potato in the microwave.

463,tifu,"This happened today, and it may not be as bad as the other things I've read on here but I'm still coming down from the anxiety and the ridicule from my siblings. I hope you guys get a laugh out of it.

A little back story: I take two types buses twice a day, five times a week, for school, so I buy monthly bus passes seeing as it saves me money in the long run. I tended to keep my pass in my wallet, but lately I've started putting it in my jacket so I could grab it easily (...and I don't have to deal with the anxiety of the ticket man staring at me as I fumble with my wallet.)
Another important thing you need to know, is that a news truck has parked where my first bus used to park. I now have to walk across the bus station to get to the other bus I need to take. Oh, and the pants are new pants and I'm sleep deprived. This whole week I've been running on fumes. 
Anyways, that's all, to the fuck up:

Today I had gotten gotten checked on my first bus. I showed the tickety man my pass with pride then grabbed my belongings and clumsily walked across the bus station. As I'm walking I put my jacket back on, and put my bag on my shoulders. With confidence I put my hands in my jacket and let go of my pass. I board the second bus but before I can settle in I am checked again. The ticket man stares at me as I rummage through my jacket. I check and recheck but there's no sign of my pass. As all this is happening, I'm starting to panic and the tickety man is getting impatient.
I assure him I had it with me, and kept checking. But then the realisation hit me: ""Somewhere between one side of the station to the other, I dropped it."" As soon as I realised that, I started to panic and tear up. I tried my best to be a man and not cry in front of this fifty-something, while I explained myself. I do think the quiver in my voice, and tears, was how I managed to get off the bus without a fine though, so score one for me. 
Anyways, the second my foot touched the pavement, I let the tears pour, then zoomed off to the bus station. I looked all over the road to see if I could find it. No such luck, so I did what any mature and sensible person would do and texted my dad. I got bombarded with the usual questions, ""Did you check your pockets?"" ""Did you actually have it with you to begin with?"" But after a bit he just told me to ask if anyone turned it in, so I went up to the ticket vendor and asked. He didn't know anything and told me to go ask the drivers, so I did. No one knew anything. The drivers then started to ask me questions, fairly concerned but it ended with ""Just hope there's a good semaritan out there.""
I slunk to the road again and looked over it, but still nothing. I gave up shortly after that and just bought a weekly bus pass (a waste of a good 15 euro) then went to school (half an hour late, mind you), where I spent the whole day anxious and hating myself. 
Fast forwards to after school and I was back in the station. I asked the bus people again if anyone turned in a lost pass. The answer was no, so I just gave up and went home defeated. It seemed as if I had wasted 42€ and January was only half way done.
The second I enter my house, I started to tell all of this to my sister, telling her every detail with as much shame as I had hours ago. Mid sentence I touch my lower back and feel something hard and rectangular. I reach into my back pocket and freeze. I felt like I was going to cry again as I grabbed my pass out from my pocket. 
I had it with me all along. 

The ridicule that followed is well deserved but now I am trying to find a way to tell my dad I found it, without sounding so dumb.

Anyway, this teacher so happened to give me an F because she told me my essays and my annotations were not good enough. Her words not mine. She then berated and talked over me and told me that I need to do better in her class and I'm not paying enough attention. The reason I'm probably not paying attention is because I'm exhausted, overwhelmed, and stretched thin with school and financially. But to my face she tells me that I'm not trying at all.

So my grandpa died around 2 weeks ago, (we knew it was coming he was nearing 90 and was in the hospital for the past year) and we had his funeral today. I NEVER wear suits but knew I needed one so i went out and rented the cheapest one I could find.

Around 30 minuets before we were supposed to go to the funeral home, I realized I hadn't purchased an undershirt with my new suit. I only had one clean shirt, which happened to say ""I paused my game to be here"" on it. I had a button up shirt I wore over it along with my suit jacket. This is where the fuck up begins.

My Grandpa was loved by many, so my ENTIRE family drove, flew, and took off work to show their respects today. THe funeral home was very hot inside to say the least. SO obviously I took the suit jacket ooff. So I am already down one layer, and when I went up to see him for the last time, (open gasket) the sight of him made my tummy turn. I made a beeline for the bathroom but sadly I was not fast enough. I threw up all over my Button up shirt. Everyone in the back two rows saw me throw up so I couldnt just clean it off in the sink or toilet, so I decided to rock the undershirt. I walk out the bathroom and the ENTIRE funeral home is looking at me. I figured it was because I had just thrown up all over myself, but I realized it was because my shirt that said ""i paused my video game to be here"" had made my gramdas tears dry up and turn into pure disappointment on her face.

468,tifu,"My  university has a degree audit system that lets you check off whether  you've met and passed the requirements for your degree. I'm beginning my  final semester so I was looking to see if I was good to go on my  semester of slack-off classes and noticed I was missing credit for an  exemption test I took last January. The audit system is new and the  university doesn't have a great track record with technology. I emailed  my advisor asking about why the credit was missing and how to resolve  this. She sent emails and CC'd me on them which resulted in the  conclusion that the audit system is broken and doesn't do its  fundamental job. Woopee.

Anyhow,  this sparks a Rube Goldberg machine of emails that my advisor told me  about where they're looking at my exemption test for this course and the  evidence I passed it. The evidence that I passed is a screenshot of the  test results sent to one of the professors in my department. Except, I  accidentally took a screenshot of the entire test, including each  question and its answer. Apparently last year when I did this, the  professor immediately told the dean that a student had accidentally done  this and they needed to fix the test so you can't screenshot the whole  dang thing. This professor, a year ago, knew that the system was broken  and just wanted it fixed. They weren't concerned about me having done a  bad thing, just fixing the system. I didn't duplicate this screenshot or  save it. I sent it to the professor in charge of the course as  instructed.

So my email to my  advisor yesterday caused them to re-open this 'investigation' and claim  that I'd violated the honor code by quote ""obtaining and distributing a  copy of the exemption exam."" An exam that I only distributed TO A  PROFESSOR. So now I'm being brought up on honor code violations all  because I dared to ask about my degree requirements being complete. If I  had not cared and just never asked, I guarantee the administration  would've forgot and I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense.

469,tifu,"Obligatory this happened a few years ago. 

My cousin was visiting and since she’s vegan and loves to cook she made some black bean burgers. They were quite delicious so I ate two. A couple of hours later I decide to head to the gym for the first time in a few months. I was planning to go to a fairly gentle Pilates class to ease my way back into working out but I arrived a few minutes later than planned and much to my annoyance the class was already full. I got super irritated with myself but decided to do the treadmill instead. Not a smart move. I’m not a runner by any means and running is normally not part of my workout. Not to mention that I was out of shape. I felt super annoyed but decide to put all my energy into the workout and proceed to run with fury. A few minutes in I start feeling a weird tingly feeling all over my body. My eyes also start tearing up but I’m so determined that I decide to push through it. Then the itching and wheezing started. I had no idea what was happening but my first thought was that I had touched something toxic on the treadmill. (Yeah, like that makes a lot of sense, I know). 

I decide to wash my hands of the imaginary toxic substance and move on to a different machine. At this point my eyes are completely welling up and I’m now also wheezing heavily so I quickly give up and decide to get back home as fast as possible. I cycle home, thankfully it was just a 5 min bike ride but my symptoms are now worse and I feel like I’m about to collapse. I’m also itching all over and when I get home and see myself in the mirror I realize I’m completely covered in hives. My face is entirely swollen, so much so that I almost can’t see out of one eye. My skin is also completely red and weirdly wrinkled. I’ve never seen anything like it, I looked like an 80 year old monster. (I was actually 30 and arguably not monster-like). 

I decide to shower, my symptoms don’t get better so I consult Dr. Google. After a few minutes, lo and behold I have a diagnosis. I had forgotten that I was mildly allergic to beans. Nothing too serious, I usually just get a mildly itchy throat. This time, however, eating beans followed by an intense workout caused something called exercise-induced anaphylaxis. This is a specific type of allergic reaction that can be triggered by eating certain foods followed by intense physical activity. THANK GOD I decided to stop my workout when I did because ultimately it can lead to cardiovascular collapse, ie DEATH. I took some allergy medicine and was fine a few hours later, and now equipped with one more reason why exercise can kill you.

470,tifu,"This happened to me on Monday but I waited until now to post it because I wanted to make sure there were no last minute updates. Also as a disclaimer I’m typing this from my phone so apologies in advance for any format issues. 

Here’s a little backstory. I (24M) have been living with my parents for a few years while I studied and looked for work. Recently over the last couple of weeks my dad and I have been removing the old tile floor to replace it with something more modern. This caused the house to be cement dust hell! Nothing was safe, everything that wasn’t closed tightly would be littered with dust. I had to clean my room Saturday night so that I could sleep and decided I would put a wet towel under the door to keep dust from entering my room the next day.

On Sunday morning I went to church like the new good catholic boy I am (it’s only my second time going and I’m doing this so that someday in the not so distant future I can marry my girlfriend&lt;3). While at church my dad decided to get a head start and started removing tile from the living room. Due to my sleep loving nature I ended up waking up late and scrambled to leave the house, but I regrettably did not close the door with the towel as I had planned. Of course I didn’t really worry about this because being late to church class was more pressing at the time. 

I get home to get slapped in the face by a cloud of dust and immediately get to work. After a few hours of choring I finally go to my room to find the door wide open and feel the sting of a dagger pierce my heart. The room I worked hard to clean was once again covered in dust. My mother sees me defeated and offers to deep clean my room the next day. I was exhausted at this point so I agree. I simply do a quick sweep of the bed and the floor to get some dust off and out, take a shower, and crash for the night. 

The next morning I go to work and excitedly come home to see a clean room. I say hello to everyone and begin eating my dinner. With every bite of creamy cheese chicken and veggies I relax more and more. I wash my plate and hug my mom saying “thanks for the food! Oh and also thanks for cleaning my room”. She hugs me back and says in spanish “you’re welcome mijo(son) but regarding your room I had to clean out the closet too. There’s been some leaking pipes and the bottom wooden edges have began to rot. I cleaned out everything and we’re gonna have to replace that. I’ll show you but I also wanted to ask about something”. Generally at this point when a Mexican mom needs to ask you about something in your room an ‘oh shit’ defense protocol activates and you start thinking about every possible scenario and how you can weasel your way around it. Success rates are pretty dismal but I was overly relaxed and liked my odds. 

As we walked to my room I heard her footsteps behind me. In my mind I thought and analyzed how fast was she walking? how hard did her feet hit the ground? My Chancla (Sandle) senses weren’t tingling,  but did she have a weapon in the vicinity? After all this my first instinct was that she found some rolling papers or an old vape pen that I hadn’t used in a while. She already knew I smoked weed and while she didn’t like it she understood where the world was moving so didn’t say much about it. My response would have been swift and precise “mom I haven’t smoked in months and honestly I already quit, I like my job too much and there’s a future so until it’s illegal to test for THC I’m gonna stay clean, let me throw those away I honestly just forgot about them”. Perfect response... or so I thought.

We finally arrive to my room. I make the first move “so the pipes have been leaking? How much do you think it’ll cost to replace the wood?”. 

She points at the closet and says “well we’re gonna worry about that later, right now the tile is top priority. I don’t know how long it’s been since you cleaned that closet but it would’ve been impossible to notice it without taking everything out. I wanted to ask you about this though”. This is it, the moment I wasn’t even ready for. She quickly removes a gym bag to uncover something... no someone in my life I had completely forgot about. Time took a sudden pause as I flashed back to when my family had gone camping and due to work I had to stay home. I had purchased my first male masturbator. An adult life size butt and puss silicon sex toy which I named Tina after some girl I saw once in college that I thought was hot whose name was Tina. What a weekend that was!

“What is this?” My mother asks while looking at me in a state of disbelief. 

At this moment I forget the English language. My embarrassment can be seen through my face for possibly the first time ever. I immediately start saying the only word that can be understood in both English and Spanish.. “no no no... no no.. no”.  

“This is disgusting” she says “I swear I was throwing up when I saw this” 

I still can’t say anything more than “no... no no no.. no no..” but now I’m finding myself guiding my mother out the door. 

I think she understood what I was feeling so she didn’t press the issue any further and walked out the door as she said  “You better throw that shit away I’m only gonna tell you once”.

I finally remember more words and say “yeah, no I will, I’m really sorry, that’s... no.. no I’ll throw it out” 

Since then I haven’t been able to look her in the eyes.

She needed relief, so we went to the store, and decided to try out IcyHot.
We got to my house, and I immediately rubbed it into my girlfriend's back and arm.

Here's the problem: the smell won't come out.
I changed the sheets on my bed and washed the mattress cover and pillows, but the smell won't go away.
It seems like it got into the carpet through my girlfriend's clothes while she was in the shower, and no amount of rubbing will get it out.
It's also in my brand new weighted blanket, which will need dry cleaning.

So this happened a couple of years ago me (22M) and my bestfriend or should i say someone that im close with? (22F), went to a party together. This party was a 2 nights party so we had booked a hotel not so far away from the party. So on the day of check in, we checked in, everything was fine, brought our own booze and had some drinks before we got ready for the party. As we were getting ready she started to undress herself, there i was, sitting infront of her looking at her tits and im like woah. We were close but not that close, so i just looked at her while she gets ready. And at that time she was single after a long term relationship, i was currently on a break with my then girlfriend, so i thought im going to get lucky tonight after the party. We then proceeded for the party, had a great time, grinding up behind her and all thinking she wants it too. Went back to the hotel and had a shower, she was done and lying in bed and i lay beside her thinking if i should make the first move, thinking about all the signs that were presented to me earlier. So i did, we had a great sex that night and when it was done, she smiled and said 'why arent you sleeping?' I just smiled and went to sleep, The next morning i woke up thinking was it drunk sex or we really had feelings for each other so i tried again with her and it happened again. And one more time that night after the 2nd day party. So i assume it was not a one night stand thing and we really had feelings for each other, i mean i did.

It apparently drove against a street sign und its front right everything was crushed. I think it was still fit to drive, because the street sign was close, but the driver moved the car on the bike lane, to be out of the street.

First I was pissed, that someone put it on the bike lane. 

Then I thougt the driver must have been drunk, because this is not a difficult road.

I thought the car is empty and the driver left and waited until someone picked the car up. I was far away and took a picture with my phone.

When I drove further I saw that the driver was still in the car and seemed like he was waiting.

My first respone was FLIGHT, because a strange man who is drunk is never someone I want to talk to, and i got scared, he's gonna scream at me.

It took me another ten minutes to summen the empathy that this person might be in shock, and I should have asked him, if he already called someone. I just assumed that he did, since he was waiting in the car.

Still, I should have talked to him, because being is shock sucks, drunk or not.

I have no idea if he was really drunk.

I deleted the picture.

I wanted to call the police, but then I got scared to admit, that I did not help him immediately. I think it's my duty as a citizen, isn't it?

I am not sure if I feel worse cause I am an ass or because I let fear rule me.

If I had been the one sitting in the car, seeing someone take a picture and then driving by, without asking if I need something, I'd be really pissed.

I just really hope that next time I will do the right thing right away and not be scared.

475,tifu,"So, my phone had a hardware problem with the audio jack. It had been malfunctioning for few months now and like a lazy ass I had been procrastinating getting it fixed. Until yesterday, when my dad's phone also broke down, so he was going to a local repair shop, I took this opportunity and handed my phone to him to get this fixed alongside. 

Now, I had been using my phone upto the moment I handed it to him, and it never crossed to both of our minds that I should remove my password so the guys at repair shop could verify if it's working after fixing it. In case you're curious, my password was - **[Friend's Name]sucksdick**.

You may have an idea now what happened. He arrived at the shop, and I got a call from him (on another phone I had at that time), and he asked -

Dad : "" *Hey, these guys are asking for your phone's password so they can check if audio is playing* ""
 
(Sh*t! I forgot to change it - was my first thought. I'm facepalming now as he hands the phone to other guy)

Guy : "" *So, yea, what is it ?* ""

(A hundred thoughts racing my mind desperately searching for a possible getaway, but after a minute pause I just blabber it out in a jiffy.)

Me : "" *It's ********* ""

(The guy sounds confused and so he takes a double-take. Also, my phone was on the speaker because I can hear my dad inquiring it again.)

Guy : "" *Um....s-sorry, what was that? Can you spell it out?* ""

(And I'm thinking - Oh great! Yes, make it more embarassing until I wish I could skin myself alive rather than doing this.)

Me : "" *It's * * * * * * * * ** "" 


Maybe the network had a problem because this guy still couldn't get it, and asked me to just text it over to my dad. I typed out the password and just send it to my dad, hoping I could get a run over me before he gets home. The awkwardness persisted during the call because he suddenly shut up after the guy asked for my password again, as if listening carefully. But somehow this dreadful situation finally came to end after eternities.

Right now, I can plug in my earphones and listening to Linkin' Park, and making a mental note, to make my password SFW from now on. At least I didn't have a dick pic in my phone, yea, some people got it worse. Typing this out on the pavement alone since I got kicked out of the home.

Kind of a short one, but I'll start by saying that I frequently sign up for giveaways, usually tech-related. I have literally not once been picked as a winner of one of those giveaways before this, but one day that finally changed: I won an Xbox controller on a giveaway by Microsoft! It was a special edition colourway (but just a standard controller, not an Elite) and I got picked as one of like 10 winners out of tens of thousands of people who entered, so of course I felt quite happy about getting the controller. They DMed me on Twitter so I gave them my address, waited two weeks or so, and the controller showed up in the mail. Neat!

A week later I got a letter from FedEx saying I had to pay $50 in taxes and shipping fees; it was shipped overseas. The controller is worth $60...

477,tifu,"Well to start things off my apartment has a fitness center. Nothing crazy just a few treadmills and other equipment. I decided to take a few hits before walking down there. All is fine, there’s only one other person here, no big deal.

Fast forward I’m on the tread mill minding my own business and this guy is one treadmill away from me. That’s when my high just hit me and I realize I’m super high. When I get this high I just start laughing for no reason, I don’t know why but I just do.

Anyhow I’m trying to keep my composure and not just randomly laugh standing 4 foot away from this dude. I was probably good for what felt like atleast 10 minutes, but then I couldn’t hold it anymore and let out a pretty good laugh.
Now it’s quiet in here and the tv isn’t even on. So while I’m still laughing, in my mind I’m like “oh shit, how do I play this off”

Genius high me decided to pretend like I was on the phone with someone since I had my AirPods in. So I start saying shit like “Yeah that’s wild” or “We still going tomorrow?” I’m paying no attention to the guy though because I was still embarrassed about the random laughter.

Anyhow I walk out about 15 minutes after pretending to be on a phone call. I’m thinking I’m slick as hell and played that so well. Then I go to take my AirPods out of my ear and realize they’re not in. They were in the case the whole time. I immediately panicked and thought oh shit, I just stood next to this dude talking my ass off to no one for 15 minutes.

So, as the title suggests, I play the clarinet. It was time for our yearly Christmas concert and I was sitting in the bleachers waiting for my turn to play. (Our band classes are split by grade) So, me and my friends were just messing around when one of them either found an orange, or had one, I don't remember. I looked at the orange, looked at him, then looked at the end of my clarinet. It's fate was sealed. He jammed the orange into the bell and we snickered as I tried to play the instrument. The concert started and the beginning band started to play as I IMMEDIATELY FORGOT ABOUT THE ORANGE IN MY CLARINET.

My turn eventually came up to play as I walked up to the chairs. Clarinets sit in the front of the band and as we started to play our first piece, I sat there in stunned horror as I realized that my clarinet wouldn't produce a sound. I shamefully sat there and tried to find the problem as the audience stared at me. I eventually gave up and just waited and tried to fake playing till my part of the concert was over. As soon as I got up, I walked over to my friend frantically as I explained that my clarinet wouldn't play and how I was about to literally have a heart attack. He stared at me for a second before asking, ""Did you take the orange out?""

Went to my place at 2 am to collect something (which I don't remember now) on the way back to my friends place I checked if I had his apartment's access card and once I reached there I realized I left my phone and my apartments access card. So I went back to my apartment hoping my roommate would be there to open the door and then I realised there was no one at home when I left and once I got to my apartment, I couldn't get in for obvious reasons and decided to go back to my friends place only to realise that I left unit's access card at his place and he went to sleep.
So basically I fucked myself over, I could have gone to the reception and asked for a temporary access card to my apartment but I was paranoid if they'd figure out I'm high.

Well the night before my friend and I went to an amazing night club! Probably not the best thing to do when you have a flight at 9 the next morning, but we were in Vegas. So yesterday morning we woke up on time but took a lot longer to pack than we thought. By the time we got to the airport. They said we were to late to check in and we missed our flight. That was the first fuck up. So the flight attendant said if we paid $100 we could go on another flight but it had 2 stops and we wouldn’t get home until 11pm. That’s $100 down the drain just wasted. But sadly that’s not the only fuck up. We went to VAS to Kansas City which is a terrible airport imo. While we were in Kansas we boarded the plane and was about to leave. That’s when I fucked up again... I know smoking isn’t aloud on the airport or on any airplane but I when I went to go put my vape away I instinctively hit it and an attendant seen me and said “DONT DO THAT AGAIN!” In a stern voice. So I said “Sorry just hit by habit. Won’t happen again.” Well I thought that was the end of it but nope. 2 min later another person came up to me and said I had to get off the plane. Well vaping on a plane is a federal offense and they said I was lucky I didn’t get arrested. I knew what I did was wrong but I didn’t think it was that bad. Well luckily after smoothing things over they gave me another flight for today at the same time.

I was washing the dishes, and as I usually do, I used some apple vinegar to finish some polishing on the silverware (classy me).

Now, it was in a very short time that it hit me. And the realization wasn't from the burning first, but the smell. Because when my fingers touched the liquid from the lenses, it reactivated the sharp smell it has and the second I put the lens in my eye I thought ""why do I still smell vinegar? OMG, I DIDN'T WASH THE VINEGAR OFF!!! OUCH...."" and that's when it started to burn. And it burned long... Of course, I took off the lens immediately, but that wasn't quick enough.

485,tifu,"Obligatory this happened \~10 years ago, not today. My friends kept insisting I write a TIFU about this, so here we go.

I had been training tennis for roughly 1.5 years now, and I was slowly starting to get good at it. It was coming up on my 7th birthday, and I remember being not particularly excited about going to tennis training, as I had diarrhoea for the past couple of days.

When I got to the training hall (this was indoors) I started getting warmed up, jogging, stretching, drills, the usual. About 30 minutes into the training, I started to feel a tad bit uneasy; I wasn't in any deal of pain, I just had this feeling of a storm brewing, and I mean a **BIG** storm. Needless to say I ignored it, and carried on with the training because, well, I was not going to miss anything that my coach said, right?

Wrong. Oh very very wrong. After 10 minutes of discomfort, I felt a sudden shift of movement in my bowels, followed by an intense desire to shit. And I cannot articulate how intense the feeling was. Shit was more wicked than a tsunami, multiplied by ten, it was almost impossible to contain. I squeezed my clenchers like a hydraulic press and ran to the bathroom, telling my coach ""I'll be back in just a minute"" on the way there, because I wasn't going to shit my pants in front of others.

I felt the thunder down under stronger than ever and as I got near the shitter, I pulled my pants down in preparation for the assquake which was about to happen. I kicked open the door and lunged my body towards the throne in a final attempt of salvation, sat down, closed my eyes, and with the pressure of a water jet cutter, the shit fired out of my asshole like rounds out of a semi-auto. Accompanying the immense feeling of relief, I also felt a comforting yet unexpected warmth delighting my buttocks, keeping them nice and cosy.

Oh shit, oh fuck. The realisation hit me. I forgot to pull the cover up. I opened my eyes expecting to see the worst; boy was that an understatement. Right off the bat, I noticed the half-solid shit all over my shorts and legs, the streak continuing all the way up to my lower back. As I took a glance around the room, I saw the shit was constantly flowing onto the floor, the walls splattered with drops of poo ranging from the size of a dice to, quite literally, a tennis ball. A few spots even managed to make their way up to the ceiling.

Thus, I devised an ingenious plan - I was going to single-handedly clean up the entire toilet. Firstly, I started with myself. I took off my shorts and carefully cleaned my legs by soaking toilet paper in the sink and scrubbing my skin clean; I didn't know what to do with my shorts so I just put them back on. The next stage was the clean-up: I proceeded to scrub the floor and walls clean, effectively wasting an entire roll of toilet paper (luckily for me there had been a spare roll to the side of the shitter). 

The next and final part was going to be tricky and messy, but I didn't care - I simply had to get it done. The entire cubical must have been at some sort of slant/angle, seeing as a large portion of the stinky poopy had flown its way to the back wall. Without the aid of toilet paper, I scooped up the remains bit by bit and carried them over to the sink, where I had dumped my delivery and washed my hands each time. The whole process must have taken a while, seeing as as I was finishing, my coach being seriously worried about me, barged into the toilet and caught a glimpse of a shame-stunned, shit-smothered, putrid and severely scarred 6 year-old boy, before uttering ""the fuck?"".

My coach, having ordered me to stay put and wait, promptly left the premises of the nearly-pristine toilet (as a result of my divine plan) and called up my dad to tell him about my *incident*. My dad, being the hero he was, and still is, arrived in under 5 minutes equipped with an abnormally large towel to carry me over to the car.

Ever since then, I have had many more incidents involving poo, it's almost as if I had been cursed for my life. If you'd like to hear more, feel free to PM.

Moral of the story? Do not belittle diarrhoea &amp; shit when you feel the need. Oh and always pull the cover up.

I live in England and I am in sixth form.
F=friend
Sorry If the structure is all over the place. 

So me and F were walking to science when we realized that we were very late so started to run. This is when the FU occurred. F was running so quickly and tried to pull out his phone to check the time when I bumped in to a teacher. He slipped and then fell. Hard. At first I was laughing a lot when I saw him trip mostly because I thought he was laughing (spoiler alert he wasn't) and so did I. Everyone crowded around checking that he was OK.(Spoiler alert 2 he wasn't) while I was still laughing. Then a tutor came and told me to stop laughing but at that point I could not stop laughing. He rolled over and then I saw it. His nose was bloody and crushed. HE FELL ON HIS NOSE. I don't think I've ever changed mood so quickly in my life. At this point, there were medics around him and they were then loading him into the ambulance. I was so worried. Then, it started to sink in that everyone saw ME Laughing hysterically at someone who seemed to be seriously injured. Everyone was then looking at me like I just pushed an elderly woman into a busy. I. FELT. HORRIBLE. I felt like the biggest asshole. After my lectures I went to the hospital to check on him. He broke his arm in to places. My heart sank. I apologised profusely. I was even crying because not only was F one of my closest friends, he was my first friend I made that sixth form. I considered him family. But I threw that all away. He did not forgive. He didn't even talk to me. I genuinely like the scummiest pos.

I matched with a nice young man on Tinder and he expressed similar interests in hiking and exploring with me. After a few days of talking back and forth, we decided to finally meet up and go exploring some local trails. 

Theres an abandoned cement factory by my house that actually leads to a scenic rail trail that is used by bikers and anyone else who wants to take a leisurely stroll. He was more than enthusiastic when I suggested that we explore the ruins. We packed up and set off on our adventure that evening. 

The trail leads through a set of four large, ""silo,"" type buildings before veering off to a fork, where the right trail would take you to the abandoned foreman's house (I assume that's what it was because it looked like a house but the contents left behind dating back to the 80's made it seem more like it was some type of office). We went to the house and started exploring the rooms. There were old filing boxes scattered all over the ground with papers strewn about. Obviously other people that had been there thought it would be funny to tear all the furniture apart and throw things around. My date was following a few paces behind me before he disappeared into a different room while I was stepping over the detritus to get to the bathroom. All of a sudden, I hear a loud, ""ow!""

I turned back and hollered out to him asking if he was okay. A few seconds of silence and no answer. Right as I was about to call his name, I hear him shriek/groan loudly. I call out to him, only to be responded to with a sound that can only be described best by whatever this combination of letters sounds like: ""RRRRRRGUHUUHNNGUH"" 

I could hear him running out of the house and at that point I run around the corner only to be faced with an impenetrable fortress of wasps swarming in the air. I really had to choice but to run right through them to the exit, so I did. I bolted behind him up the path before catching up to him and both of us stopping to catch our breath and start brushing off the remaining wasps. 

My second mistake? Saying, ""well ... At least I'm not allergic to bees.""

I had been stung before but only as a child. It must have been the sheer quantity of the stings that caused the reaction, because by the time we got back to his car I was bloated like a balloon animal. He called an ambulance and by the time they arrived I was struggling to breathe. He kept asking me if he should come with me to the hospital, to which I painfully tried to tell him that I would never expect him to do that. I was treated at the emergency room and released a few hours later. 

Did not get a second date.

489,tifu,"On mobile. Sorry about the formatting. Me, my wife and my little one are traveling in Australia at the moment. My original itinerary was to fly to Melbourne, drive to Adelaide, fly to Kangaroo island and fly back to Melbourne before returning to our home country. So I made a rental car reservation with Avis for the drive from Melbourne to Adelaide with the plan to drop off the car at Adelaide. The original quote  was around 900AUD. 

By the time I went to pick up the car, the bushfire situation on Kangaroo island has gotten so bad that I found it not suitable for us to visit anymore since we have a little one.  I decided to change the itinerary, skip the Kangaroo Island part of the trip all together and drive back to Melbourne directly after visiting Adelaide. So we would spend a few more days in Melbourne before flying home. I talked to the Avis rep at the Melbourne branch and they changed my reservation when I picked up the car. The updated quote was still around 900 AUD after adding a few more days to the rental period. But since we will be returning the car to the same location, the one way fee is removed. Hence the quote was about the same. 

For the last 2 days the bushfire smoke in Melbourne has gotten so bad. Here is the fuck up. My stupid brain tells me that I should not drive back to Melbourne and just drop off the car at Adelaide like I originally planned. Somehow I did not call ahead to change the reservation first before dropping off the car. I just drove to the Avis branch yesterday and dropped off the car. I anticipated a rental rate change but I did not expect the amount that the Adelaide Avis rep told me. My jaw dropped when the rep told me it would be 170AUD per day and the total would be ~2800AUD. So it is like $1900 difference. Minus the $300 one way fee, there is still $1600 difference. 

The rep said there was nothing she could do and told me I should contact the Melbourne branch and see if they could adjust the rate after the fact. I called the Melbourne branch this morning but the rep told me no and there was nothing she could do. She just gave me an email for customer service and ask me to contact them instead. 

I found the new rate absolutely ridiculous. This left me thinking. Does that mean they could change the rate to $1000 per day and I still have to pay?

I work for the pathology department of a major medical facility. A physician requested a send out test to a lab for NGS testing but their order form had more tests than they wanted. A pathologist and I let the doctor know that we can actually perform the other tests here at the facility and we can have NGS done at the outside lab. So after getting written confirmation I amended their order form and called the facility to let them know we will only do NGS testing with them, but the other tests will be done in house.

 

Here is where I fuck up. While on the phone with the lab I confirm the patients information with their name and DOB. But they were having trouble finding them, so they asked me to confirm the last name phonetically to make sure it’s correct.

So back in my freshman year, I was hyped up for college but didn't know about many, so I found some website that would automatically spread your info such as graduating year, intended major, name, address, etc to whatever colleges or universities you checked off. In my infinite wisdom, I checked off EVERY SINGLE ONE. The next 2 years (freshman, sophomore, and part of junior) I would get mail every single day from different colleges. And since I wasn't in a hurry to read them, I did the most logical thing, and bought a trunk to store all of them in.

and there it was as i suspected, my entire fucking schedule for when and how to jerk off, for an entire fucking month. she didn’t know what to say, i didn’t know what to say and i swear i lost half my life span in those few moments of silence before i akwardly brushed it off as something i did as a joke(it kinda was true though) i dont think she believed me.

needless to say, i did not «schedule» another appointment with her.

I hope you enjoyed reading the most embarassing fuck up of my life. atleast i can smile when thinking about it now.

494,tifu,"This is hot and fresh, happened less than an hour ago. 

We are moving and want to get a sprinkler system installed at our new house.  I'm making calls to get bids, making initial contact, that kind of thing.  Simple stuff where you just repeat the same basic information about yourself, your project, and that's about it.  A task I'd performed successfully multiple times earlier today and countless times in my adult life.

The builder gave us a recommendation for an installer and they were the next to last call for the day.  Simple, notes in front of me, let's go.

The automated system picks up, I navigate the menu and end up in a voicemail for ""Sarah.""

Beeeeep.

""Hi, Sarah!"" I begin to say before realizing with a start that I have never spoken to Sarah and when she listens to the voicemail she will not have said hello and probably won't be expecting a big loud greeting, much less by name, because isn't it weird to even use a name.  Do I even greet people in voicemails??

At this point, I realized the system is recording and a couple of seconds have already passed and I have only said ""H-,"" maybe taken a weird breath, and come to a halting stop.  I was unsure of what to do next.

""Ummm, Hiiii.""  Perfectly covered.

Stumble and recovery, NBD.  We've got this, brain.   Carry on and start explaining.

""I am buying a house!""  Weird.  Tone it down, man.  ""It's a new house but it doesn't have a sprinkler.""  Awkward but better, keep it up.  ""So I'm going to need one of those, and that's why I'm calling you!""

What.  The.  Fuck.

At this point, I decided to power through.  ""Which you already knew, because that's what you do, right. So I got your name from ""John Builder"" and he told me to talk to ""Bob Sprinkler"" but I don't need to talk to Bob, I'm sure I can talk to you, Sarah.""  

And at this point, I debated hanging up, but don't because I worry that I've given too many details and they might be able to figure out who I am... which, at the moment, mattered very very much for reasons I can't explain now.

Suddenly I remembered that voicemails can be erased, or even re-recorded, but that seems silly.   It's not that big of a deal.  Just carry on and stop trying to make up things to say and just read info from your notes.

""The house, my house, not my current house, the property, that I'm buying,""  SAY THE ADDRESS

""The address is 1234 Street Ave.  Townville.  54... 541... 5431.... no... 123?  54123, maybe??""

This is sad.  We're making Sarah sad in the future and we need to apologize.

""I'm sorry, I really thought I knew the zip code, or that or had it written down.  I'm having a hard time.""  Okay, that is both too much and too vaguely ominous.  ""I mean I'm usually better at... recording... emails?""

Is this what a stroke is?  Am I having a stroke?

""Voicemail!""

\*extended audible sigh

""Right.  Okay.  So I need a sprinkler system.  That's my address.  I'm very sorry.  Here's my number but to be clear, I will not blame you if you never call me back.""

It's NOT A DATE! 

""Oh, god.  It Oh Peeh at 555-678-4321.""

Okay, last chance, ""Sorry, again, for not being able to leave a voicemail."" Nailed it.

""I promise I will pay you on time.""  

Oh, FFS!!  Hang up, you chattering nincompoop!

\*ends the call

""No, WAIT!  The delete option!  I forgot about... well, shit."" 

\*another extended audible sigh

Way to go, ace.  I think we're done for the day.

Hi.  Just letting you know I feel really bad about myself for this and I  think you should never judge someones appearance even if you don't  personally know the person.

I was  messaging a few friends and one of them sends a random snapchat with no  context. Me being an idiot didn't know it was him in the picture and I said ""ew"". He responds saying ""whats wrong with the picture of me?"" and  im like shit I fucked up. Instead of admitting to my mistake like a  normal person would I say ""Its a bad angle"" making everything so much  more worse. He obviously gets angry at me and blocks me and my other  friend. I tried apologizing by saying ""Hey, sorry for what I said about  you yesterday I was acting like and idiot. Your beautiful and you should  know that"" but since he blocked me I cant do that :)

496,tifu,"So it sounds obvious, i lost my phone whats the big deal just call it? Track it using gps? Wifi? Hahah...

So i have 2 phones, 1 is android and 2 is an iphone. I have used 1 for 3 years and upgraded to 2 a few months ago. 2 became my main phone and 1 was more of a media entertainment for my android content.

Why i have 2 phones? Well I basically use phone 2 for everything now but 1 is still my main music source as the current Apple earphones are trash and i cant plug my good earphones (with an audio jack) into an iPhone lightning socket. 


How i tfu: 
Since 1 is already 3 years old, the battery is quite a bit used. So in order to preserve battery i turn off location, Bluetooth, put the phone on aeroplane mode and worst of all, i have no sim card in it because i had moved my only simcard to phone 2. So yea, was on the bus to go gym and I looked at phone 2 (the more expensive one) and said it would be a shame if i lost it, so i head to the gym and an hour later i go back to my locker and i realise, phone 1 is missing. 

Tried tracking it using google but since all features are off, the phone is locked AND has no power button or sim card, i cant track the damn thing &gt;.&lt;

I do have wifi on even in flight mode and it has connected to the gym before, also my house wifi (but its only showed as last connected to my house wifi meaning its lost on the bus before i got to the gym)

497,tifu,"I went out with a coworker for drinks after work. 4 G&amp;T's, a chicken sandwich and 2 glasses of water later my kind coworker drives me back to my job to get my car.

I turned onto my street only to be displeased with everyone's cars lining both sides of the road. Not a single spot to be found. My frustration was quickly met with joy when I noticed a potential spot right in front of my building. Only problem was a trash can happened to be placed in the middle of the spot. This is a common tactic used in big cities where neighbors put trashcans in spots to deter people outside of their own family to park in said spot. Welllll...NOT TODAY! 

I pulled up alongside the potential spot and got out of my car. I nonchalantly grabbed the can thinking it was empty only to find it was full and fairly heavy. So I grab the handle with both hands and lean the trash can on it's wheels to move it. As I began to tilt, a wave of rotten trash juice spills out from all sides. It cascaded down both of my arms, both of my legs and fills up both of my shoes. 

The smell of putrid trash waste stung my nostrils and I began to dry heave/gag. I realized how bad I fucked up my situation and begrudgingly hopped back into my car to continue my search for a parking spot. As I pinched the wheel with index finger and thumb, gagging every few seconds, I continued scanning the sides of the road desperately trying to find a spot. 

A few minutes passed and I finally found a spot about a block and a half away from my apartment. At this point, I was about 2 dry heaves away from losing my chicken sandwich. I called my girlfriend before I arrived at my apartment. 

Me: ""I fucked up! I tried to find a parking spot and dumped a trash can on myself. I smell like shit. Like it's bad, hun!""

Her: ""Why didn't you park in the spot behind our apartment? I texted you it was open when I got home..?""

Me: ""......are you fucking kidding me...?""

I opened the door to my apartment, lumbered up the stairs in shame and faced my giggling girlfriend. Her giggle shortly turned into gagging when she got within a few feet of me. I stripped naked, threw my clothes in the washing machine and took a shameful shower.

498,tifu,"tl;dr at the end

Background: This happened in ~1998 when babysitting my 3yo sister and her ""friend."" It's in my top 3 most horrifying stories from a life brimming with unbelievable nonsense. My friends encouraged me to share, so I did some reading and made an account. Let's see what Reddit thinks of What I Got.

Story: As a rather mature oldest child, I often had to babysit or at least monitor my two younger siblings. This particular time, I had to watch my sister and her classmate on their play date that the moms INSISTED upon. My siblings were chill, fun kids, so I had no idea what entitlement could await me when sitting for others. Now, it's possible that this child wasn't actually so horrible, but it was my first experience with an entitled kid, and it left me aghast. 

To my fresh, naive, 8 year old mind, this kid was a grade-A spoiled little jerk of a brat. The kind of 3-4 year old whose mother dressed her in Mary Janes, pantyhose, green velvet dress with lace, and ribbons in her hair (details prevail as a result of the trauma). Definitely an only child, and perfect pearl of her parents' eyes. She played normal games, but SCREAMED the whole time. Red light/green light became a toy-flinging tantrum session. She tried to take our family's Barbie dolls and threw herself on the ground screaming when I took them back. To her credit (and this is in retrospect, considering all the EK's I've met since then), she did calm back down fairly quickly when I ended her tantrums. I dealt with this for an entire day, which left me stressed, exhausted, and unable to comprehend what I'd just experienced.

By the end of the playdate (Yes, I dealt with them solo the whole time despite being 8 years old. No, my mom wouldn't help because ""you've watched both your siblings before, and I don't know why she keeps screaming but obviously you're doing a bad job babysitting. Now keep them quiet; I have homework to do.""), I convinced them that it was TV time. I turned on something of their choice and brought in some snacks. The snacks were barbeque potato chips. I opened the bag and let it sit open in the middle of the table so everyone could grab some, whether they were on the sofa (EK and sis) or the rug (me). I genuinely preferred the rug; it was soft and had a good TV viewpoint. But this was where my FU began, since I no longer had eyes on either child unless I actively looked for them. 

So we watched TV. We ate chips. It was peaceful. I enjoyed the tranquility of low decibel volumes. I was lulled into a false sense of security. Then the chips stopped crunching. I wasn't sure why, but I kept eating them. Suddenly they tasted... different. Different and sour and wrong. I noticed they were almost wet when I ate them, like summertime, when people eat the communal chip bowl with their wet backyard swimming pool fingers. The taste put me off the most. I looked at the chips and one wilted in my hand. It even smelled wrong. I then looked up at who was sharing my bag, and saw that THIS GROSS CHILD WAS WEARING PANTYHOSE WITHOUT UNDERWEAR. It was irritating her and she'd been scratching her nethers the whole time we watched TV, and likely the whole visit. So I sat momentarily frozen in horror as she mindlessly plunged her fetid, lubricated hand into the chip bag, then shoveled the seasoned crispiness into her gaping yaw and, in one fluid motion, scratched herself HARD while spread-eagle, and dove back into the bag. All while maintaining eye contact with the TV. 

Needless to say, I grabbed the bag, threw it away, vomited, REFUSED to admit why I'd done so, and procured different snacks in different bowls for each of the two preschoolers. I waited until her mom picked her up, and then told my mom I would never sit for that child again. To which she replied, ""Yeah I don't think [little sister] enjoyed her company either.""

501,tifu,"This happened yesterday. I recently found out that you can now use a Health Saving Account (HSA) to pay for eligible items on Amazon. I decided to peruse the site and found that most first aid kits are eligible for HSA use. I've got 3 young-ish kids who seem to always have bandages stuck all over themselves, so I thought it a good idea to have a real first aid kit on hand.

I ordered a pretty decent one that has a pretty decent plastic storage box and the ability to hang the kit on a wall by the handle if desired.

The kit arrives and I open up the box, look through the contents, reorganize everything in a way I like, and get ready to hang the damn thing on stud in our storage room.

The handle has two keyholes to allow you to hang it on push pins or nails or whatever, but it was folded down and secured with a sort of fastener to the top of the case. I struggle for about 5 minutes to pop the handle up with no luck, so I grab a flat head screwdriver to give me some leverage. The thing is still surprisingly stubborn, but finally gave way as I increased the pressure a bit. This not only freed the handle from its storage latch, but also broke one side of it off the case, creating a sharp plastic protrusion. When the handle gave, the force I was applying was no longer being resisted by anything and my hand shot forward over the broken plastic, slicing the side of my palm open. Whats more ironic than cutting myself on a first aid kit is that nothing inside of it was sufficient enough to patch me up. I had to drive to urgent care to get treatment. 5 stiches. 

The moral of the story is first-aid kits are a lie.

502,tifu,"I've only ever tried shaving my balls once or twice in the past, because I have very sensitive skin and always get really irritated and bleed a little bit. 

Yesterday though, I decided would be the time I properly shaved everything down there. I started first with some cheap clippers at a short but not completely shaved setting to mow the bulk of the lawn, and then went in with one of those electric shavers that gets really close to finish it off. It did a pretty good job, and I ended up feeling super smooth! There were only a few small cuts too, so I thought of that as a plus.

But here's where I really fucked up: I have two different aftershaves. One definitely stings my face a lot more than the other, so I guess somehow I'd convinced myself that the other didn't sting at all, and just smelled nice? I decided to put that on my twig and berries to help mitigate any swelling or redness that might otherwise occur. So I rubbed some all over down there. Just as soon as it touched my skin, I knew I had fucked up real bad: the pain was worse than anything I'd ever felt. It was as if someone had coated my junk in gasoline and lit it on fire; I couldn't help crying.

503,tifu,"This actually took place over the last 6-12 months. Enjoy! Language and sexual harassment warnings.


Last spring: I was sexually harrassed at work by a member of the top management at my company, and nothing came from it from their side since he is so super important. I had a full breakdown, hospital and time off work for chronic depression and anxiety, and in the end had to quit.


Summer: I was already in a 7.5 year relationship with someone who was (and still is) my best friend, but it wasn't really working more than that. They were having intimacy issues, and even though we tried to work on it, it ended up not being solvable. 


I meet this girl. It was amazing, it was intense, and looking back now, it was all too fast. But I let myself get swept up in it. I'm usually pretty chill but I really lost myself in the whole intensity of it all. She told me she loved me after 3 dates, I probably should have seen that as a warning. 


Anyway, everything was great, amazing for about 3 months. We made serious future plans - moving in together, leaving the country (we're both internationals in the country we're in). I ended my previous relationship. She went through proceedings to divorce her wife (it also wasnt working for them for 2 years and the wife was very emotionally manipulative, or so she told me. I dont know what to believe anymore), I was going to move in with her in her place next month, so I cancelled my lease for my apartment. She made me feel like I was hurting our relationship by not being 'ou't and proud enough, so I came out to my conservative family, friends etc. She made me feel bad for not always being super comfortable holding her hand in public (because I was newly 'out) and because PEOPLE STARE AND I HATE THAT. Also I think I was just getting my head around the fact that hey, I'm dating a chick. This is new. 


I really thought I loved her. Fucking endorphins.


In mid October, her personality began changing. But I kept trying to make it work because I'm a big believer in love conquering everything. I wasn't super happy, and I guess she wasn't either, but Im adaptable and dont usually give up on people. 


December, it got really bad. She is trans, and was actually planning to re-transition since the hormones weren't working for her body (making her sick), and I really feel like maybe her head was getting messed up. She was also struggling with being a trans woman, as she (her pronoun choice) felt she is bi gender instead. She stopped taking hormones abruptly, without consulting her therapist. She started dressing more masculine. She asked me to refer to her by her dead name in private. It was complicated, but I tried my best to be there for her.


On Dec 30, she came home (mine, she was staying here until I moved in to hers in feb) drunk with her EX WIFE and some random dude, packed up her stuff, is all ""I love you and I'm not breaking up with you"" but her wife was flipping out at me, not letting me speak to her privately and trying to intimidate me, calling me an abuser.and a rapist (which I'm still wondering wtf about) IN MY HOUSE. It was so awful and fucking traumatizing.



I feel this is mostly the ex wife's work, because when I would have moved in, she would have to move out, actually get a job (she was relying on her ex for money), and maybe lose her EU visa (they are both Russian). So vested interests, even though she used to treat her like crap. Until I came in to the picture, then all of a sudden she started acting nice again because I think she realized how my ex felt about me and it was getting serious. But it's no excuse - my ex sat there and let it happen.


So it ended. I've cut all contact, deleted all social media ties, contact numbers, deleted the photos. No contact since then at all. It was all just too much. 


Now, I'm in a situation where I have no job (but decent savings, thankfully), in a foreign city where I don't speak the language, no real place to stay from next month. I don't know where to go, because the family ties are a little strained, and staying in this particular city is near impossible without a job or the language skills.


So yeah. Currently selling my entire life and trying to get down to 2 suitcases. Trying to work out how long I can survive on my savings. Trying to figure out where next, will have to leave this country which I've been loving in for 4 years. My home country is a no-go. And I'm shit scared.

Okay so my wife and I have a three bedroom home. One bedroom is meant to be for our son but we used it for storage the past two years as he slept in our room in his crib and now bed. We finally got around to clearing it out! Hooray!

We set it up for him with all his toys, a little bed, a nice toy box. We hung up some Christmas lights so he wouldn't be afraid of the dark. My wife uncovered all the stuffed animals she used to have. Before we got married I used to take her on dates, I learned pandas were her favorite animal so I brought a unique panda stuffed animal for her along with some flowers. She loved them and kept them all, and now she decided since our son loves stuffed animals as well they'd be fitting to be left in his room for him.

While arranging everything she decided to put all the stuffed animals on the dresser which faces the end of our sons bed. Not even kidding when I say there's easily thirty stuffed animals there off all varying sizes and colors. We put him to bed last night and he fell asleep fine. Next morning my wife tells me he's taking a nap in our room. I ask why, as we just let him sleep in his room and it was fine. She said he refused to go back into the room. She tried napping him there and he was scared as hell, like his hands were shaking and he straight up refused to go back in the room.

He's still asleep in our room and I walk past his room and peek inside. It suddenly dawns on me that he's afraid of his stuffed animals.. She arranged them in such a way that they all face the bed. I walk to his bed and crouch down and look. EVERY SINGLE ONE IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM. I mean every one of them has their head drooped down a bit and the all stare right at the poor kid. There's even a really large panda on a chair by the dresser that has his hid leaned on the wall like he's comfortable watching.

We absolutely laughed at our own idiocy and felt bad that we probably scarred our poor child. We rearranged the toys so they are not staring straight into his soul. We'll find out tonight if that was truly what he was afraid of.

506,tifu,"So this TIFU happened last night... first of I am a 30 year old male and I live in San Diego in a small 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with my mother in law, my wife, and our beautiful one year old daughter. We grew up here about 15 minutes away from the Tijuana, Mexico border and we are no strangers to partying accross the border (having an 18 year old drinking limit, being the San-Diegan norm to drink and party there before you can legally in the states).

So we are now 30 and 29 years old, and it's been at least 10 years since we've done any partying or taco Tuesdays in our high school days. Our daughter just turned One year on January 5th and we decided to have our own celebration as a milestone of keeping our first baby alive and naturally healthy for one whole year. We deserve it, were amazing parents and luckily our mother in law lives with us for now and she helps baby sit ALOT. She is amazing and I wouldnt trade her as a mother in law for anybody else.

Having that said, we decided that we would enjoy this weeks Tuesday, and celebrate by going across the border during the afternoon for a couple of hours, getting some cheap tacos and drink some Dos Exis XX beers ($1 tacos and $1 beers) and we ate about 20 dollars worth of tacos and beer which could feed a family of 6. Well in Mexico, it's well known to not have any knowledge of ""A""  health inspection ratings, or any health inspections for that manner. Me thinking I still have the steel stomach of a teenager, I regreted this decision shortly after.

As soon as I crossed the border I felt it... I felt bubble guts brewing, and the burps and farts coming out so quickly were indication of something not going right deep inside my loins. A few hours later my stomach was still brewing something nasty but wasn't ready to exit. Finally in the middle of the night after laying in bed in pain for 30 mins with my poor daughter and SO, I felt a sudden urge to have to run to the bathroom, as if an internal nuclear countdown had started... 5... run out of bed, waking up our daughter, 4... stumbling in the dark almost tripping over clothes, 3... run down the hall to the dark bathroom, 2... run towards the toilet in the pitch black bathroom, 1... exploding vomit released as I made my face to the toilet , but my head goes right into some flabby feeling texture. It was my mother in laws belly.

I had faceplanted onto my mother-in-laws belly as puke spewed at an alarming rate out of my mouth all over her stomach, legs, and god knows where else. I quickly apologized and just told her to hop in the shower as she screamed in panic and disgust. Let's just say things will never be seen the same way.

So this happened last friday and things have finally settled down enough I feel I can talk about it.

I had spent a good part of the day helping my dad get his boat winterized. We washed it down added, fuel stabilizer and a bunch of other crap needed to help it ride out the winter. My dad brought the truck around to the trailer and I jumped out to attach it to the hitch.

So I lowered the trailer down onto the hitch and at first it didnt latch, so I pulled the trailer forward some and got it to latch or so I thought. We only had to go less then a 1/4 mile up the road and we were in a hurry so I didnt bother to attach the safety chains to the truck. I then walked back up the truck and made a comment to my dad about the chains and was told not to worry we are going right around the corner....

So we get to the end of the driveway and turn on the road, everything is fine up until we hit a bump in the road. Turns out the trailer wasnt attached to the hitch on the truck and due to not using the safety chains the trailer was now detached and on its own heading down the road. I dont think I will ever forget the sight of it scraping down the road.

The trailer proceeded to veer to the right, hit a concrete island in the road and launch the boat off the trailer, over the island and into the curb. Fortunately for us there were no other cars or people involved in this as it very well could have killed someone. We were able to get the boat and trailer out of the road before we got any tickets or fines as well. But my carelessness caused about $5000 in damage to the boat....

TLDR: Rushed hooking up boat trailer which then came off the truck and launched the boat into the road",Tifu rushing to hook up a trailer.
508,tifu,"I was really drowsy checking out Twitter when a video of my president appeared and it talked about concerning topics but he just ignored the questions. I watched the 6 minute interview and every time they said ""In your first year as president..."" I got really confused but decided to retweet with comment, putting something like ""It hasn't even been HALF a year and we're really fucked""

It was 7 PM and I kept minding my own business until two hours later.

I had eaten dinner when my best friend texted me the screenshot, asking what was wrong with me and if I had even seen the video. That's when I remembered that my president entered on late 2018 and not 2019. I was so embarrassed I ran to Twitter ane delete my stupid comment, couldn't even see how many people saw my tweet because of how ashamed I was. 
 
I entered the group chat with my friends and they were all laughing at my stupidity, sending voice notes of them laughing their asses off and even made memes of me and my tweet.

That tweet was up for two hours and countless people could have seen it. I'll stay off Twitter until I recover my dignity.

2 years ago I was student president at my old school in my not-so-small city. Me and my colleagues decided to start a project for a card which gave access to discounts in quite a few stores around the city center and asked to four other schools near us. It actually became bigger than I thought and we got to potentially sell our cards to 4000 people. We eventually sold around 2000

Back to us, I was the IT guy, so I made a website so we could inform our users which discounts they could access in which store. We also put a qrcode on the cards themselves linking to the website (pretty professional)
I was pretty proud about it, so I also put it in my Instagram bio, so that people could see what I achieved

When our year of mandate expired I kinda forgot to renew the domain... I didn't care anymore and it would cost me money.

Today (about two years later) I was cleaning my IG account and I misclicked on the link. It sent me to a porn webpage. 
Yes, there have been 2000 cards around my city with a porn website qrcode on for about two years
Yes, people kept using the cards since we made contracts with stores for two years
Yes, I kept a porn website redirect in my bio on Instagram
No I didn't remove it yet, I was laughing too hard

510,tifu,"So I've got an aquarium and I love it. I noticed that the water temperature was way lower than it should've been, which means my heater wasn't working.

I took the broken one out, and put in a temporary one. My aquarium is 30 gallons. The temporary heater was for 1 gallon aquariums. I figured if nothing else, the fish could at least huddle around that one until I got home with a new one. I only had the one gallon heater so that I could warm up salt water when I changed out the water. 

I pulled some money out of my savings and rushed to the store. Bought a new heater, rushed back. I was somewhat panicked and in a rush, so I just kind of threw the small heater out of the tank and quickly turned on the new one. All was well.

Except I forgot about the old heater. I'd just finished some laundry. I had work soon, so I tossed them on the floor and figured I'd fold them tomorrow.

About two days later, I was playing my ps4 and enjoying some wine when I smelled burning plastic. I couldn't figure out where it was from. I looked around, couldn't find anything. I figured it must've been the neighbors, because I looked really hard.

But a few hours later, I had a pretty bad headache. My roommates were also complaining about the smell, so we all started looking around the house and couldn't find anything. Ironically when we searched my room I apologized for the clothes on the floor, which I'd put off folding since I was working extra hours.

The next morning I went to fold my clothes. And suddenly something burned my finger. I looked, and the towel I was holding had a big ass hole burned into it. I looked down, and the small aquarium heater was literally IN the floor, smoking, and a deep hole surrounded by brown ash/whatever else was in there.

Thankfully, it was only the towel that had a whole burned in it. But I'm so fucking lucky that this didn't start a fire. Now the question is how I'm going to explain this to my landlord and how to get it repaired. For now I'm just going to buy a rug to cover it up.

511,tifu,"Sorry About Formatting, I’m on mobile writing this as I can’t move from my bed due to my immense ball-pain.

So about two hours ago I got sent a video from my friend about how you can use your balls to taste various things, so of course my genius self decided to try this out for myself. So my first few tests were a success, first one being sweet chilli sauce which, when on my balls, resulted in me tasting it perfectly. I then tried lime juice, apricot jam and Vegemite to varying levels of success. Now, this is when the real shit happens. As I was running out of things to taste through my balls, I decided to try use some Tabasco, and see if i could taste it like all the others. Not thinking that it was a spicy hot sauce, I poured some out onto my kitchen table, and plopped my testicles on top, and proceeded to wallow about in the tabasco for a good minute, like a wrinkly elephant having a bath in some mud. After about a minute, i tasted the tabasco through my balls, so I wiped it off and, deciding that I had had enough of ball-tasting, went about my business. Now I don’t know why it took so long to take effect, but about ten minutes later my balls started getting hot. I thought nothing of it, but then after about another minute they started getting unbearably hot, then started to burn like the fires of hell. From there the pain escalated to an absolute immense and unspeakable burning pain in my testicles so, without any milk in the house, I spent the next few hours with a can of apple cider on my balls to try and help the situation. It is here I end the story, with me lying in my bed with a cold apple cider on my ballsack, unable to sleep even though it is 2am.

TLDR- Soaked my balls in Tabasco to try and taste it, ended up being in immense pain for several hours.

513,tifu,"I'm 18/m so I still live with my parents. I made a huge mistake and accidentally left a video of myself masturbating on the computer (we all use the same one)

I made it for my girlfriend and the file was too big to send from my phone so yesterday I uploaded it to the computer so I could send her the whole video and I forgot to delete it. I was on the computer earlier today and happened to come across it and as soon as I felt it I almost had a panic attack. I quickly deleted in, opened VLC to make sure no one saw it, but according to it's recent history, the last video to be played was the video I made. But I never watched it on the computer, I didn't need to, I just needed to send it. So someone other than me opened and watched the video, and seeing as how my dad is the only other person who uses the computer extensively, it's almost a guarantee that he's the one who opened the video. I'm sure he didn't know what it was, the filename was the generic automatic filename you get when you record on a phone.

I pray he closed it soon after opening it, I don't want to think about the fact that he might have seen me ejaculate at the end. To be completely honest,  I'm extremely self conscious about my penis size and ""inadequacy"" down there in general. It's average sized in terms of girth, but it's just really short, around 2 inch to 2.5 inch while hard. And sorry if this is TMI but I really don't ejaculate a lot, it's pretty much always just one small spurt and that's it. I understand everyone is different, but it definitely makes things a little worse, and someone seeing that my penis is small is embarrassing no matter who it is. And I also understand that he's seen me naked as a baby and a child and everything, but he hasn't since I was maybe 11-12 so I don't really count it.

Any advice? He's been a bit distant today and now it makes sense. Do I bring it up? Never speak of it? The worst part is not being 100% sure that he saw it and so I feel like I need to get closure about it. Even if it turns out he did see it, at least I'll know. It's better than me wondering forever. Any suggestions of a way I could go about finding it out from him, but without making it even more uncomfortable?

A group of about a dozen of us were on our last few days of the training course, and I thought it be the best time to break out some booze before our final meal in the accommodation we had. I had gone out and got the cheapest boxes of wine I could find and proceeded to get a little too drunk. More so than everyone else at least. When my boss comes in for dinner, and announces that a VIP well be joining, everyone else sobers up naturally, except me. 

We sit down at dinner with our unscheduled guests and the first thing that comes out is a massive cheese platter. I grab it from the centre of the table and slam it in front of myself, telling people to ""back off! My cheese now!"" Before shoveling a load of brie in my mouth. I found this hilarious, but the sober version of me knows not to take cheese away from people. I did put it back, eventually, but a little too late. My boss takes me aside the next morning and tells me she was going to send me to one of the best resorts, but after last night was considering firing me.

First of all, I'm always very careful with my dental braces, cleaning, flossing, everything to preserve it. But the food, it's my weakness from day one.

The first problem came when I took a bite of a plum and bang, the metal wire (the one that connects all the parts of the braces) disconnected from the last tooth.

Luckily,the dentist put it back in place and everthing was fine. But then it disconnected agan, this time with a delicious butter toast. Oh, I was so furious, I didn't want to believe it. But I had an appointment,in a few days so I decided to wait... then I saw the oreos. So delicious and creamy, they called my name and I went there, warming up a glass of milk to dip them in.

When I started eating them, I lost control and got excited and when I noticed the piece of the metal wire was gone,broken,lost forever inside of me and I still had a cookie in my hand,so of course I had to eat that too,but not with milk this time,but with my tears.

Now I'm afraid this little piece of metal that got cutted is now there inside my guts cutting everything too. This is not a good way to die!

My eldest child is nearly 18, I'm a single mum (very single right now). I have a large delivery coming tomorrow and had to clear some space at the side of bedroom. No big deal, it was only a small set of drawers to be moved. I could have emptied them to make them lighter so I could move them myself but no...I was being lazy and decided to ask my son to help me.
After repeatedly shouting him to exit his gaming man cave of a bedroom, he storms in annoyed at my audacity to disturb him! I of course, remind him that I birthed him....he grabs the drawers and lifts them.
At this point they tip over and my vibrator floats gracefully in the air in what seemed to be slow motion....did multiple somersaults across the floor to make its presence even more known than I thought possible.....landing on his foot.

Cue the awkward moment of silence whilst we both stood in shock staring at the bright pink love machine now resting on his big toe. He turned....gracefully and walked out of my room. Neither of us has made the first move at communication as yet. This could be a long wait!

I was 13 and I’ve always been pretty tight. I tried months to put in a tampon but it never worked. It was pretty annoying but I kept trying. 

One evening I was finally able to insert a tampon. I shouldn’t have. I was so happy and proud of myself. I told my mom, my sister and my bf and I went to sleep peacefully. I made a big mistake. 

I woke up and I went to the toilet. I tried to take out my tampon and it was stuck. I was so scared. I tried pulling it out so hard but whenever I did I got super lightheaded and I almost passed out. This went on for 2 hours. I got so scared that I had to lay with my legs in the air cause I’d pass out. 

I was pretty sure I couldn’t do anything. I was panicking super hard and meanwhile my tampon was leaking. I told my mom (I used to be very uncomfortable talking about my period and stuff like that) and she just said that she’d put a blanket over me and would help to pull it out. It didn’t work. At this moment the tampon was in a really uncomfortable place and I couldn’t sit normally. 

We didn’t have any clue of what to do so my mom decided to take me to the ER to see a gynecologist. I was sitting there super uncomfortably, feeling like I could faint any minute. 

Eventually I saw the gynecologist and I told her what’s going on. She told me to lay down on the chair and she has to cut open my hymen with scissors. Even when she cut open my hymen I was almost too tight to pull the tampon out. 

After she finally was able to take out my tampon I was told that I might need surgery if I was hurting while having sex. This scared the shit out of me. Luckily, my first time wasn’t too bad. I bled a shit ton and it hurt a lot, but it was okay. Even my boyfriend was hurting because I was too tight. I’m good now though. 

I used to be super ashamed of this story and I told no one, but now I can laugh about it

At my job I bring jokes that my coworkers, they had never heard on my lunch and breaks. So I came across fake phone numbers to give out in case you don't want give your real number.

My baby sister loves and is obsessed with Harry Potter. She know everything about HP. So I texted her the Harry Potter: Administration to Hogwarts School of Magic phone number as my new phone number around 8 my time, 10 her time as she lives in a different state. I knew she was asleep and will see my text in the morning, since we talk everyday.

Here is where the TIFU happened...Well the next day (today), We video chat through facetime for a couple hours and I forgot all about the fake number. Then our mom called her phone. My sister tells me she will call me on my phone so she can connect our call on a threeway as it was our only time we all get to talk. I was waiting for her to call and she was taking a longer time to call me back. Then my mom called me. As soon as I said hello my sister raised hell on me.

She was pissed that I gave her a fake phone number. She had erased my phone number in her phone and replaced it with the Administration to Hogwarts number that morning. Then fix it by asking our mom for my correct phone number. She and my mom and my uncle heard the whole recording to Hogwarts and was embarrassed.

519,tifu,"I have an ego. This is something my gf knows, and I know, and everybody who we mutually know is aware of. This happened after New Years Eve. We were staying at my sister's place, alone on a couch in the converted garage. Gf and I were going at it, and I had maybe drank a bit too much. We were having a good time, and she got there, but I hadn't yet. Fine. After some time, she commented that she knows I can't hurry up, but i should still try, and i jokingly said I might try calling another name than hers. It's not romantic, but it's a running joke that a certain female celebrity we both are attracted to could be fantasized about, and either of us can have a free pass if we ever meet her and have a chance to have sex with her.

When that doesn't work, I jokingly decided to try shouting my own name. That, combined with whatever she did at that moment, worked and worked well. I went off like Pompeii. I promise I saw colors that can't physically exist, and my body twitched like I was having a seizure. I slid off that couch on a gross wave of cum, onto the garage floor. It was **magical** for a short moment. Then reality hit me. And by reality, I mean the palm of the gf's hand. I had to explain to her that I hadn't planned on it.

520,tifu,"Not the worst of fuckups, but here goes.

Background: It's nice to have sharp kitchen knives. As a Christmas gift I got a sort of carton-based letter, with which you send your knives via the post to a company to get an industrial-style foundation sharpening (much needed every once in a while, even if you have a regular knife sharpener at home). They thereafter send it back to you via the post as well. The letter is literally unbendable, due to its content.

This morning I went to post the letter. For reference, the postal collection boxes in Sweden (where I live) look like [this](https://www.idg.se/editorial/0/path/1.703168.1527502972!imageUploader/3272512706.jpg). The letter did fit into the opening, no problem, I pushed it in entirely and closed the lid. I did notice however that the letter did not ""fall down"" into the box as it should have done. I went back, looked: it wasn't easily reachable, but I could have spent half a minute to fish it up with my fingers. Being on my way to work I thought that ""Eh, it will fall down sooner or later.""

Fast forward, coming back home from work, walking past the mailbox. I look inside. Now there's 5-10 other letters of different sizes all stacked on top, the box is more or less overflowing. I had basically created an unbreachable knife-based blockade due to my lazyness. To make matters worse, the recieving/delivering-place in which you hand biggerboxes/letters over to a physical person was in a store just 10 metres away.

To be fair I did call their customer care to try and get it resolved (it didn't, not before the mailman went there to gather today's post). To be (un)fair, I told the customer care that ""someone"" had blocked it, not me personally. Standing there talking, I saw a lady trying to post a letter, finger-punching into the opening, and then forcing her own letter in.

If someone had an urgent letter that had to be sent today for some reason, then I'm truly sorry: My sloppy/lazy behaviour, causing a knife-based blockade, probably ruined your tomorrow, or your upcoming week.

TL;DR Was lazy and wrongly posted a letter containing knives in a regular collection box, rather than delivering it to a postal office. It caused a blockage/clog that caused a dozen other letters to remain uncollected even though they were put in the box well before the collection deadline.

My wife and I have been married for almost ten years now. Both of us have always struggled with our weight since we started dating. We have both been up and down on the scale, but both of us have gained steadily since kid #2 came into the picture almost 2 years ago most likely due to a coping mechanism for stress. We both know it’s a problem, and we are going to get back on track soon, but I digress. I’m currently around 325lbs and she’s a probably 50lbs more, the difference is I’m 6’7” and she’s a couple inches under 6’, so the proportions are different. Just to let you all know, I have no problem with her weight; I love every pound of my wife and find her very attractive, and since I’m not skinny I would never want to infer that she’s overweight.

I have generally worn the same size shirt since high school; I wear an XXL. If I lose or gain weight it just gets a little looser or tighter on me, which is no big. Even at my heaviest it was not so tight that it was unsightly, just tighter then normal. Since I’m at my heaviest I’ve ever been by about 10lbs I’ve toyed with the idea of wearing XXXL, but never mentioned it out loud to anyone.

On the particular day where I FU (not today like most posts) my wife and I were folding laundry. It was just after Christmas and I had gotten a couple new shirts so one of them ended up in this load. There was one pile with one shirt in it, and I could have sworn it looked exactly like mine I had just been gifted, so I picked it up to put it in my dresser. As I picked it up I saw the tag up close and it showed XXXL. I was not particularly offended because of my current shape, so it made sense, but I do have a sense of humor, so I decided to make a joke about it; what could possibly go wrong, right?

I turned to my wife and said “triple XL, what do you think? I’m some lazy, piece of shit, fat ass?!?!” I was going for shock value to make her laugh so I said it louder then normal because I was pretending to be mad, and added a few expletives to punch it up. 

She turns around and looks at the shirt for a second and says “that’s actually my shirt, but glad to know how you feel”. 

At this point I turn white and apologized profusely and tried to tell her I was joking thinking it was my shirt and that I’m fat. Needless to say, none of it helped...

Everything was fine except that the day before my mom's commitment got moved 7 hours in advance from noon to 5 AM. This would have been the second time I would have canceled with my FWB in the past 2 weeks so I decided to just hang out with her at my dads place (I found out that day that he was going to be home a little late). Ps. My parents are divorced.

So before I go pick her up, I head to my room, grab a condom and the empty box that I forgot to throw out earlier. I head downstairs, grab a quick bite to eat, I leave, all is fine.

I told my mom I was out with some guy friends at Culver's and that'd I'd be home between 5:30 and 6. I ended up staying at my dads with my FWB at my dads until about 7.

524,tifu,"Today has been a crazy day for me. I had gone to the hospital here in town to complete HR paperwork for my new position, I was anxious, ready, and excited to get started! Well everything at the hospital went well and I went home in a great mood! 

My boyfriend leaves for class and I lay down for a little bit and decide I wanna bring his dog to the park and swing by Home Depot on the way. So I go to Home Depot, walk around the ENTIRE STORE looking to get a key made. Everyone was in such a great mood and so nice to me! I was like, dang I need to spend more time at Home Depot! Then I take the doggy to the park and come home happy as a clam because today's been such a good day! 

Soon after getting back home, my boyfriend walks in the door to grab his hat before heading to work, and he asks me ""Have you been wearing that all day?"" I was like ""a tshirt and yoga pants? Uh yeah!?"" And then I look down, after seeing this hysterical face he's giving me, and I notice I have my underwear on over my yoga pants. 😅 No wonder everyone was so nice. They think I'm a psycho!!! Lol gonna go live in a deep dark hole now.

To make the story even funnier, I'm wearing a shirt from Spencer's that has an alien on it and says ""Dont talk to strangers"".

525,tifu,"So I own a server, along with 3 other people

One of which is currently in the hospital . But he still is fine, just with some broken bones. So he can still be online and stuff

So he has been a great help to the new server and has been adding roles and even made an economy in our server.

I didn't know who made the new roles when I logged on. They were like  anime roles and I put who made these gay ass roles or something as a joke and put jk at the end, and that I liked them. He said he made them and that he worked hard on them and laughed about my comment too.

I then told him I was very grateful for all his help and appreciative for everything he's done. And that I was glad he got his promotion in the server.

And then he saw the role I made as a joke while we were talking, and I thought that's what he was laughing about as well. Like 20min later he says f me and that he worked hard on everything on the server and he lied to me about collaborating on making new stuff.

So I told him that I thought he had saw the joke earlier and I thought that was what he was laughing about too.

I then wrote to him how grateful i was and how helpful he's been and that i was sorry for making it seem like i didn't appreciate him.

I feel like an asshole for making him think that, i probably shouldn't have joked about it at all, even if he thought it was funny at first.

Well that's how I fucked up

526,tifu,"tl:dr: Offered to open a guy's yogurt package at school, loudly announced I have a knife and got to have a talk with the teacher after class.

   I am a high school student, and the teacher whose class this happened in knows me as a good student (probably not anymore). So, I'm chilling in class and in the row next to me a guy is struggling to open someone else's yogurt. It's one of those yogurts in plastic tubes. I carry a small (about 2 inch) swiss army knife with me, so I offer to open it. ""Yeah, let name get it"" the owner of the yogurt says. 
   In this moment, my brain shuts down, and I blurt out ""I have a knife."" The whole class heard me. As everyone is staring at me I pull out the swiss army knife and use the scissors to cut open the packet. Everyone keeps staring at me and some are laughing. I try to repair my mistake by showing the class how small the knife is and saying ""It's just a tiny one."" 
   After the class has laughed at me for a while, the teacher says ""Let's just forget this."" He did not just forget it. Throughout the class, people poke fun at my fuck-up. One asks me to cut his burrito in half. 
   Eventually I forget the fuck-up, until the end of class. We had ended early, and I was on my phone when the teacher called me to his desk. He told me that announcing I have a knife could make other students feel unsafe, and I agreed and admitted it was very stupid. He told me to not do it again and to leave the knife at home. I haven't gotten in more trouble yet, but I'm worried I will. Right now I wish I could just go back in time and stop myself. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Did you get in more trouble?

Backstory: Im currently enrolled in a Sociology course at my school and am usually the quiet kid who doesn't talk, sits in the back, whole nine yards. Thats all you really need to know. 

    Today my teacher was talking about how Hitler never actually killed anybody. That others did it, for lack of a better word, for him. He asked us how many people he killed and we all replied with ""none"", because I mean of course we did. My teacher misheard and thought someone said one so my teacher asked who. Me being awkward with no self control I shouted ""HIMSELF"" just as the class quieted down and everyone started laughing and staring at me. Some kids made comments about ""wow that was ACTUALLY good"" or ""you said that?"" and I am just soooo embarrassed. It was funny but omg, I don't think Im going to go to class tomorrow.

I’ve been growing my hair for little over 3 years, but it reached a point where any activity related to life was so much more complicated because of the length of my hair (it reached my butt cheeks).

Great, awesome. I told this to the hairdresser, but for some god damn reason all hairdressers are sadists and just enjoy CUTTING ALL OF YOUR HAIR. I watched in shock as she constantly kept going “just a tad more, a bit here. Should we stop dear?”

“YES PLEASE”

“just a tad more, you don’t want to look silly now”

This happened a few months ago, but it dawned on me, this is seriously a comical TIFU post.

So, this happened at a home I was temporarily house sitting for. It just so happened it was an old home I used to live in so the transition for me to stay at their home and watch their dog, worked out perfectly. I also knew the home well or so I thought..

This said night, I figured I could ""relax"" and took a couple edibles (CO resident here). I took a long ass shower and robe'd it up, ready for a perfect evening. A woman and a corgi. I was freshly bathed, feeling real good, a whole cheesecake to munch on, and The Office on, it seriously was a perfect night. It suddenly dawned on me that I needed to check their mail - ""high"" thoughts, they're real. I went outside with NO shoes or phone on since the mailbox was right at the end of the driveway. I have no clue WHY I didn't put on boots of some sort but again, high thoughts. I figured.. Get the mail, come back super fast, and voila. No need for thick clothing or shoes. Hair was also in a high bun, soaking wet FYI. So this house has those dreaded invisible 'lock yourself out' locks. It shows locked from the inside BUT you can still leave while it remains locked, no way of truly knowing you locked your door unless you look at the positioning of the lock from the inside. I f\*cking locked myself out, of this home, no hideakey, nothing. This was also during the time their garage was being serviced so it was unable to be accessed as well. I straight up panicked... For those of you who have had the joy of taking an edible, you can either be REAL chill or REAL **MANIC**. So this was not my finest moment. I immediately went to the back of the home to the back door, trekking through melted snow and chunks of ice on MY BARE ASS FEET. I tried to unlock the back door somehow through their doggy door all while deep sobbing and whispering obscenities and how i'm going to die here. I banged and banged on the window trying to get it to break. The corgi was freaking, I was FREAKING. It didn't occur to me to go to a neighbors home since 1) No one knows me, 2) I'm practically naked, and 3) I've completely lost my damn mind at this point. This was my life now. I was destined to die on this back porch with my ass out and frostbitten toes and hands. How long would it take for someone to find me? After deliberating for what seemed like a lifetime in the place that would kindly be my place of death, I realized the only way is was to break a window. I had to get in somehow. My hair was freezing up to the point of them resembling crunchy Cheetos and my toes were so numb, my legs were non-stop trembling. Guys, I seriously lost it. I found a random bar on the side of the house and I busted through a basement window. This break in job (shitty at best) required me to carefully get through as I was probably one glass piece away from legit hurting myself or cutting myself in sacred places. I didn't want to make more noise in case someone was listening and called the cops on me! Thankfully, I made it through with a cut on my leg, but phew. I was safe. In the end, I had to pay for an emergency replacement on their basement window so it worked out. That investment would've been the same cost as an emergency locksmith, but I chose the dangerous road of course. What's life without a little excitement and well, good ol' edibles.

Hope ya'll enjoyed.

PS, they had NO damn mail. SO either my high ass brain got the day wrong or I really felt the need to die that night, I'll never truly know.

531,tifu,"Obligatory This didn’t happen today but like ten years ago and was just reminded of it.

So I grew up in a small predominantly Catholic town. My family was Catholic but no super Catholic, I went to Sunday school and we celebrated the holidays but we only went to church once or twice a year. These instances would be would be if my or my sister’s class would take part in the service (I.e. ten Sunday’s a year a different grade would assist in being ushers passing out the hymns or doing readings).

Now my least favorite part (other than going in general) was taking Communion. For you non Catholics that’s when you go up get “the body of Christ” which for our church at least was an almost palm size wafer that tasted like styrofoam. The reason I hated it was because I have a horrible gag reflex and when you combine the consistency, size of it and the fact you’re not supposed to chew it(it’s disrespectful to chew Jesus but pooping him out in several hours isn’t somehow) this was torture on me.

Over a decade later I can still taste this unholy (see what I did there!) abomination while trying not to choke. Usually i was able to make it through but a combo of being already kind of sick (nose was stuffed so it was hard breath) &amp; my tie (we wore our Sunday best!) being too tight made a dangerous combo.

Now the true FU came when I was sat next to this kid in our class who was blind kid. Not because there’s anything wrong with that but when, Satan began his spiteful attack on my stomach and I have a mouth full of Jesus (my parents hated when I would phrase it like that) I couldn’t get his attention to get him to move so I could get out of the pew (I would have had to cross 10 kids on the other side vs only him) &amp; before I can just jump on the pew and run around I projectile vomit Jesus (and my breakfast) all over my suit, him &amp; the real kicker the back of the girl I really liked who was sitting in front of me all in front of 70% of our town since we were in the front of the church.

I got outside 75% of the way through it and the teacher came out to check on me. Unfortunately my dad being as much of a good catholic as me took off early so we had to wait for him to get home to call him to come pick me up a good half hour or so (his cell phone was broken at the time so he had none). So I got to sit in the classroom as this was at the end of service with all my classmates as the teacher led a blessing so I could feel better and come out stronger from this. Despite the fact it was the dead of winter, snowing, I was drenched in vomit and it was below freezing I begged to be allowed to wait outside vs having to stay in this situation.

Luckily there must be a God because it never was mentioned again &amp; I wasn’t known as the heathen who puked up Jesus by everyone in town.

That being said things did not ever work out with the girl so maybe Satan did win.

TL;DR I puked up Jesus in front of the majority of my town because of my gag reflex/satan",TIFU by rejecting the Holy Spirit
532,tifu,"This actually happened a few months back. In a gathering of people from work, a relatively new coworker of mine had a few beers and out of the blue asked me for a ride back to the city (the gathering was taking place in another coworker's ranch a few miles out of the city) because he had to meet a friend of his. I found it strange, particularly in the way he did it, like pushing me away from the others, but accepted to drive him where he needed to go. On the way, suddenly there's a biker waiting by the side of the road. He says that that's his friend and so I pulled over. They talked briefly, he came back in and the biker left. All of a sudden he starts to apologize for what he's about to do, pulls a little piece of folded paper out of his pocket and asks for a money bill and a credit card. By then it was obvious to me he was planning to snort cocaine right there by my side. In shock, I just handed to him the ""tools"" he required and continued driving back to the ranch while he kept talking all the way, pleading me for secrecy, apologizing for making me go through that situation and saying that he has this addiction for a long time but it doesn't interferes with his personal or professional lives.

But there was children where we were going. Small ones. And I was driving a guy high on powder to be around them. In the end though, I remained silent and when everybody started asking where we went, I just told them to ask the guy. But that ruined my day and kept eating me up inside. Back home I told my folks but they too didn't know what should I do. By then I was in the company for 9 years and had the complete trust of my boss. I felt that it would be a betrayal from my part not to reveal to her what had happened. What makes matters worse, is that the man works alone in the night shift with access to company money. I was almost convincing myself to just tell everything but before, I decided to tell to an older coworker which hosted the party. I mean, it was his house and his children were there. I thought he had the right to know. He advised me to wait. To let things roll for the time being and that I could be at ease, because he would carry this burden with me. I was so relieved.

Now months have passed, I left the company but that coworker continues there. He's a great guy, loved by everyone, perhaps most of all, by his 5 y/o son whom he also loves more than anything. Some times he says how he loves his job and that now he's getting back on his feet after tough times (I found out that he even attempted suicide at some point in his life). He recently got a girlfriend that's clearly being another pillar in his life. And to this day, he considers me a friend and I promised to help him to prepare for an exam for public service that could improve his life even more.

But the guilt kind of remained. What if the person I shared the secret with took it to our boss? I know how she is. She would have him fired right away. God knows what could have happened then. Maybe he would sink even deeper than he was and, who knows, try to kill himslef again. He sees me as a friend but I stabbed him the back.

533,tifu,"Woo! A rare post where the fuck up actually happened today!

Before the story, everyone in my school is around 14. It’s a sorta chill school, you don’t usually hear too many really weird things.

I was walking with friend A to a class. We’re pretty good friends and have some really weird jokes. We started joking about friend B. (We weren’t making fun of her or anything, we’re both good friends with B and have some jokes involving her) The conversation when something like this;

Me: Hey, have you heard B is now dating a dude in Peru?

A: Oh, but isn’t she dating John Cena?

Me: Yeah, she has like 15 boyfriends as of right now! (Obviously a joke, she doesn’t)

A: Oh yeah. How’s her pregnancy coming along? (Also a joke, she’s not pregnant)

Me: She got an abortion a bit ago.

A: Oh no! I was supposed to be the baby’s godmother and it was supposed to be named after me!

Me: Yeah, that’s why she got an abortion. She’s mad at you right now so she got an abortion out of spite. (B is not mad at A, still a joke)

A: :(

Me: Hey, who knows. Maybe she’ll get pregnant with the dude from Peru.

At this point, we are now nearly at our class. The hallways super crowded. As soon as I say the last sentence, the person in front of me turns around and looks at me like I’m crazy. I realize that the person is a teacher.

Later, I tell another friend (C) and she tells me a story from a few months ago. She was waiting for the bell to ring after PE and decided to tell some of her friends some self defense tips. She says something along the lines of “So when they try to kick you grab their ankle. Then wrap your leg around their other one and trip them. If they’re a boy, knee them in the balls.” A teacher walks by the moment she says the last sentence and makes eye contact with my friend. My friend then proceeds to awkwardly walk away. 

After asking my friend to describe the teacher, we realized it’s the same teacher.

TL;DR: I made an inside joke about how my 14 year old friend was going to get pregnant in front a teacher who didn’t realize I was joking. I tell another friend, she tells me how she said “knee them in the balls” in front of a teacher a few months ago. Turns out it’s the same teacher in both stories.

538,tifu,"So... this was something that happened very long ago, and I know for a fact the other person that was involved into this reads reddit. If you happen to come across this and familiarize yourself with this story, I'm sorry for falling one of the simplest mistakes with such drastic consequences. Frankly I had entirely forgotten about it until coming across another recent reddit post. Anyway, here goes.

A long couple of years ago when I was still in college, I got a phone call from my best friend saying he needed some help with his PC. Here is where I'll include the biggest irony and headscratcher; My friend is not as knowledgeable in computers or technology. However, I am. In fact, I've even done a whole study involving computer and system technology, management and security. Even to this day I cannot believe how I fucked THIS up.

I arrived at my friend's house, and soon he introduces me to one chunk of a laptop he was gifted from someone. Given the proportions of that thing, I would unarguably call it a gaming laptop, so that mustn't have been cheap. He said to me that the computer had a really questionable behavior in some programs, and was suspecting it would be a virus. For a good hour we've sat to thoroughly inspect it, clean the whole thing up before taking a look at what was going on. 

I hadn't brought along my USB stick that contains a fresh copy of a virus scanner (Something very useful to have, people. In case your computer gets infected, it doesn't have a chance to corrupt/intercept an antivirus installation if you run it from your flash drive!), but I thought, hey I know this program, I'll be fine if I just pull one from the internet.

DUMB. MOVE. How precisely, I do not know, but next thing I remember stumbling across, was NOT a virus scanner. It reported lots of viruses however as part of its 'download me!' plan, to which my friend replied ""See, I knew there was something up with it"". Ignorantly, on we go, and I ended up installing something every single person on the internet will strongly advice you to avoid. It ran its ""Scan"" once installed, and we thought that would be the end of it.

But while that was running, the computer became super sluggish and unresponsive, whilst we heard the fans whirring like it was an airplane preparing for liftoff. Which soon escalated into us smelling the putrid scent of burning/melting plastic combined with cooling paste. We both knew SOMETHING was wrong (but neither of us had the slightest idea it was the scanner being faulty), and the computer then bluescreened, as the whirring stopped. It did not turn on any more, no matter what we tried.

We had no idea what had happened, but the cpu was without a question deep-fried. He didn't really think much of it because he only had it for an hour or two, but I KNOW that hunk was not cheap, and felt absolutely confused what even happened and where it went wrong. Only until that realization about a week or two later kicked in; I installed a fake virus scanner, one that is INTENDED to install/run a virus that intentionally overheats your computer. I destroyed his gaming laptop, while I came to 'clean' it. To this day, I never was able to man up and tell him this was one big fuck up from me.

I'm sorry.

**TL:DR**; My friend got a gaming laptop and asked my assitance to help clean it to use for gaming. I, with my ""brilliant"" expertise in computer security, not only ended up installing a virus on it, but DESTROYING IT, deep-frying the CPU.","TIFU by updating/securing my best friend's laptop, only to end up DESTROYING it."
539,tifu,"When I was in preschool, we had a day in the park outside my school where we wore our swimsuits and ran in the sprinklers. Around that time, my older brother, who was around 7 years-old when I was in preschool, told me about outie belly buttons and the fascinating fact that some people's belly buttons stick out (still not sure whether or not that is true).

I didn't have a visual reference for this. I figured it looked something like a gerber meat stick, the ones that came in jars, sticking out where your belly button should be.

Anyway, I'm 26 now and for my entire life I've had this vivid, flashbulb memory of the moment while playing in the sprinklers that day when I saw a little toddler running around. I was amazed by the fact that his belly button stuck out from his body. It was exactly what my brother had told me! For the next 22 years, I kept this memory with me, recalling it every now and again and not thinking much of it. Just one of those ""earliest memory"" memories you hold onto for one reason or another.

Now, fast forward to the other day when it dawned on me. 

What I remember seeing, the memory that I've had for the past 22 years, is actually completely incorrect. ""Outies"" don't exist as I had imagined. What I actually saw was much more likely his toddler penis, and I just didn't know what a penis was at the time.

It's crazy, to realize this thing you've taken to be the truth for so long was actually a lie all along. My visual recollection even altered to reflect what I thought I saw. Memory is weird, kids are weirder.

540,tifu,"This actually happened yesterday. Not a throwaway because tbh I don’t really care. 

So, for about two years I had two really good friends. Let’s call them G and V. Yesterday, G texted me basically saying that she and V had talked to each other and had decided that they didn’t like me and didn’t want to be my friends anymore. Also they never had liked me and never considered me a friend. Obviously, hearing that from my two closest and pretty much only friends was sorta hard on me. I let them know I was angry, and started the whole eating ice cream while crying in the bathtub thing that everyone does when something bad happens, right?

So I’m getting out of my depression bathroom and getting ready to watch some anime, hoping that would cheer me up. As I log into Crunchyroll on my phone, I see I got a text from none other than V herself. Basically, she said it wasn’t “fair” for me to be angry at her and G. Well, okay. I guess I won’t talk to them for a little while. I finish watching Demon Slayer because I always get very behind on seasonal anime and I hadn’t finished it yet. Around then, I get hungry for dinner and my mom says she’ll make me tacos (thanks mom). This is where the fuck up starts. 

So, let’s get one thing straight— I love cheese. A lot. So naturally I put about 10 pounds of shredded cheese on my taco, like a normal person does. As I go to bite into my taco, I accidentally inhale a sliver of cheese and if biology taught me anything, shredded cheese isn’t the best thing to have in your lungs. I start coughing it up, and I think it’s pretty funny. I’ll have to tell my friend T about it later. 

Dinner finishes, and I go to text T about my shredded cheese mistake. Since I was just texting him, it should default to our text conversation when I open up the message app, right? Yeah, that sounds right. I sent him “I just inhaled shredded cheese and almost choked”. I put my phone away, and... fuck. When I texted him before, I was texting him on my computer. Meaning that was sent to the person I was last texting on my phone. Meaning...

So,  my text conversation with G looked something like this (paraphrased)

G: I don’t like you

Me: that’s kinda mean

G: sorry

Me: I’m gonna take a break from this relationship

*three hours pass*

Me: shredded cheese lmao

Needless to say, I made an awkward situation ten times more awkward. Whoops. My other friend said the whole situation have off giant “we are done, I am in love with your sister” “I’m typing this with a carrot rn” vibes (if you’ve seen that image you know what I mean). Idk I think it’s kinda funny so I thought this sub might enjoy it. 

Tl;dr A (now ex) friend texted me saying they didn’t like me. I responded saying I needed to take a break from that toxic relationship. Three hours later, I accidentally sent them “I just inhaled shredded cheese and almost choked”. F.",TIFU by accidentally texting an ex-friend about my troubles eating a taco
541,tifu,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I was 10 or so years old playing games on Scratch.mit.edu and I come across a strange word. ""Furry."" I Googled it and come up with anthropomorphic animals. Awesome, I loved animals and anything related to the. I found WikiFur and clicked on several links and found another new word: ""yiff.""

Cue another search and lots and lots of furry porn. I knew what sex was, but didn't know the word for it and hadn't seen any pictures of it.  My 10 year old mind was blown. I didn't masturbate or do anything, I just scrolled in pure fascination. 

I wondered if there was yiff art of anthromorphic characters I knew and looked it up. Of course it was all there and I was completely and utterly fascinated. I added another word I just learned to the mix: “gay.”

I made a habit of googling yiff on my grandma's Mac whenever I was over but always closed the tabs. I got bored of it soon enough though.

One day, my grandma was going through her history to show me a video she had seen on YouTube earlier that day and I made the realization that she constantly used her internet history like that.

542,tifu,"Obligatory this didn't happen today but on Jan 1st.

It was a day after heavy drinking, almost dying from fireworks and seeing some old friends and wishing for a happy start into the new decade. A typical new years eve. We had great fun yet i was devastated the next day and all i wanted to do is just chill at home all day smoke some weed and pack my bags because I'd go on vacation from 2nd to 8th Jan which i was really looking forward to as it was the first proper break from work in a long time.

We stayed up until about 7am the day before, so i decided to sleep in until my body was ready to function again. Since i'm a little pothead I prepared a bowl for whenever i woke up to have a nice wake'n'bake. 

I naturally woke up really hungry. (i didn't feel ill or anything, i don't really have hangovers but my head is just really cloudy) I made myself something from the last scraps i had in my fridge because i didn't want any stuff to go bad whilst i'm gone considering i live alone. 
My egg-potato-noodle mix didn't quite cut it though and the only other edible things i had was cereal. And that sure as hell wouldn't satisfy me when high either so i decided i'd order some food. (for anyone wondering why i didn't go out and buy something from the grocery store, it's a holiday, nothing is opened).

This is the point where I'd usually call the pizza place I have ordered from for years, the guy on the phone has been the same ever since i first ordered there as a teenager. Pizza Guy recognizes me by now and i don't really need to tell him what i want since it's always the same for atleast 5 years now (1 Big Pizza Salami, 2 Mezzo Mix and 1 Big Mixed salad; that salad used to be for my mom but i still order it just because Pizza Guy always asked if i forgot it so i always played along. I ended up liking salad this way. 

I lit up the prepared bowl and floated to a 7/10. I felt nice, put on some music and really craved this Pizza now. 
For some reason (probably because i was a little high) i felt like i was gonna end up getting judged from Pizza Guy who recognizes me, since that would've been my 3rd order in a week or so. So i looked up other Pizza places nearby and decided to order from Dominoes since it has a rather solid reputation, what could go wrong there? I ordered some fancy Pizza with a lot of meat, i wanted to try something new and just picked the ""bestseller"", 2 cokes (i usually got Mezzo Mix but again, trying new things ya know) and a salad. I already paid online with my card so I needn't worry about fucking up the payment whilst high. I got an SMS stating the Pizza would be there in about 27 Minutes. Sounded a bit *too* precise but whatever boats their float.

A thing you have to know about my apartment is that the bell of the building door doesn't always ring. I would need to open the door of the building for the Delivery guy to get in though so to prevent that from happening I start sitting infront of my window (3rd floor) around the time the Pizza was supposed to be there.
And so i begin waiting after 20 or so minutes.


30 Minutes... I'm thinking it must be there any minute, the *27* Minutes were probably just a bit inaccurate


40 Minutes... I'm starting to get REALLY hungry, if the Pizzas late it should arrive by now


50 Minutes... I start to feel bad because i betrayed my usual Pizza guy and this is what i deserve


60 Minutes... I start starvi... OH wait there's a delivery driver from Dominos but he's not going to the entrance of my building.
I watched him and was playing with the idea of shouting out my window that he's at the wrong building but i kept quiet because i was still pretty high and too scared of another person actually ordering a Pizza at the same time. 
Then he stood in front of the building but never went in,i figured he didn't see my name on the bells and had other deliveries to do and just drove away. I already paid for the Pizza with my card but i thought I could deal with that stuff later on because i really really really want pizza at this point. 

The guilt overcame me and i proceeded to call the usual Pizza Service and ordered my Pizza Salami, 2 Mezzo Mix &amp; a salad, Pizza Guy recognized me and i had to wait another 40 Minutes until I started my usual window watching. After some time a Pizza delivery car arrived, i snatched my delivery at the door and as i wanted to pay the dude said that I had paid for it already online.

At this point i start to put the puzzle pieces together... i now received the delivery that was about 1,5hours late, and **another** order is set to come, i wouldn't be able to eat the second Pizza on the next day since i had to leave around 9am and it's getting dark already so i started to come to terms with me just having to eat 2 Pizzas by myself. I just told myself to fuck it, ate my Pizza and was pretty full after that. 

Just as i was done eating the first Pizza the second one arrived as expected and there isn't a single universe where i could make the poor delivery guy return the pizza because of my impatience, so i paid for it and was trying to find a solution that doesn't end up with me consuming 2000kcal more than I should.

**I decided to eat it too.**

In total i spent over 40€ on 2 deliveries consisting of
1 Large Pizza (with a lot of meat, can't remember what exactly it was)
1 Large Pizza Salami
2 Big Mixed Salats
4L of Soft Drinks

and you sure as hell bet high-as-a-kite-me devoured everything. every. fucking. thing.
As i finished eating i lit up another bowl and start laughing about my own stupidity while also starting to feel kind of sick. I was really stuffed at this point and decided to just go back to sleep as today isn't really a day for me. 
The next thing i know is me waking up from my food coma being way more panicked than the time i had realized i ordered 2 Pizzas. 

I DIDN'T PACK MY SUITCASE AND HAD TO LEAVE IN 20 MINUTES^whilealsoneedingtoshowerandotherthings

In the end i packed whatever i could into my rather small backpack not thinking thoroughly about what I'd actually need for the week, my friends made fun of me for only bringing a small backpack and in hindsight, they were absolutely right to do so. I didn't have NEARLY as much clothes as i would've needed forgot 70% of my bathroom equipment and ended up needing to lend everything from a friend or buying stuff on the go, i ended up spending ~130€ more than i would have if I had just ordered one Pizza and 130€ is quite some money for me. 
The way to our destinaiton wasn't really fun too since my stomach didn't like the idea of eating a meal that would've been appropriate for 6 medium sized people. Nothing serious happened in the end but it was quite a memorable day full of ups and downs.

544,tifu,"This story happened yesterday so it is still freshly engraved into my mind.

I was sitting in my college class and a friend pf mone tapped me on the shoulder and said that I should check my mail, well it turned out there was a massive spam going on where the college sent an invitation letter to some sort of event but instead of sending it individually they sent it to the whole school and everyone was replying to it.

So I started reading the replies (that added up every 2 seconds) and saw a lot of good memes and the like. Also a lot of copypasta so I decided to join in on the fun and send some copypasta their way too. I saw a good one so I sent it amd all was good, then another friend saw the script of the ""the penguins of madagascar stop racism"" video and he said he really wanted it so that I should send it to him.

Here is where I messed up. 

So I copied the entire pasta and sent it to him on discord, I also decided it would be a fun idea to send the shrek script to that spam that was still going on, I selected the entire script but didnt copy it, might've pressed ctrl v instead of ctrl c. So I decided to just paste it in the mail spam and send it there. 

But..... i sent the wrong one, my dumb ass didnt bother checking which one it was because well i thought I was smart enough to not mess up something so simple. So I sent the penguins of madagascar stop racism script. I realized my mistake as soon as I sent it so I just decided to focus on the assignment. But of course there just had to be a black girl in that class who was also checking the mails the entire time.... she gave me a death stare I wont ever forget.

545,tifu,"So this FU actually happened today. 


A work colleague of mine is going for an MRI scan tomorrow and was telling me all about her concerns about it. She has had endometriosis for a while (a condition that affects many internal organs like bowls, womb etc) and the scan she's going for is to identify if any of her organs have fused together which is painful and can happen in extreme cases.


In my immortal wisdom, I decided that now was the perfect opportunity to make a joke about how awesome it sounds to have a 'super-organ' doing all the bodily tasks that the single ones normally do. 


It wasn't received well. 


She burst out crying, ran to the toilet, and had to be consoled by another female colleague. 


I'm obviously notified, no amount of grovelling apology was enough, I'm the talk of the office, and now I also have a meeting with HR tomorrow to discuss my conduct. So a good day all round.

546,tifu,"Im not even sure where to start. So I guess to start, I met this friend about a year ago, online. We shared a ton in common, both military guys, huge nerds. As we talked more, we realized how much more we share in common. It was great. We have some differences, (hes gay and I'm straight, and I'm christian and hes atheist), but on the hole, we share almost everything in common. I had in invited him to a discord channel I own early on in the relationship, and as our friendship blossomed, he rose in the ranks. First mod, then admin, as we talked to much and I trusted him a ton. I finally got to a point where I trusted him as much as myself on the server, and I had a thought someday ""if I dissapeared, I would wa t him to replace me"", so I decided to promote him to co-owner. 

In early childhood, I was called selfish alot. And it was warranted. I didnt like to share anything. Clothes, food, toys, you name it, I hoarded it. And as I grew older, I thought I grew out of it, well that's partially true. It still comes out on occasion.

Heres where we connect back to the story.  We have been talking more recently (hes looking at getting out of the military and possibly renting a room out of my place with me and my wife), and I started butting heads about keeping him as co owner of this server. Its partially for selfish reasons, because I like being the center of attention (this server started from nothing, but has now built up to about 300 members), but is also due to us butting heads on what needs to go on the server decisions wise. 

It reached a breaking point today, in which he asked how I felt about keeping him co owner after some hints from me that I was considering it. Once the cat was out of the bag, there was no putting it back in. He has told me now that hes not sure what our relationship is and whether I was being fake at all during our friendship, and how much i really value him as a friend.


So now I'm stuck between two difficult decisions:

A). Keep him co owner, and him always have the Part of his brain that tells him that I'm a shitty friend on occasion and think about myself

B). Demote him, and possibly lose my best friend I have had in a long time.


I'm really not sure what to do at this point, and I just feel like either way I'm screwed, and I sacrificed my best friendship for a stupid discord server.

547,tifu,"This did not happen today but some years ago when I was still a student. I was (and still am) a huge nerd wearing mostly black T-Shirts with more or less nerdy prints.

I was studying computer science, had a side job as a programmer and also, as an organist, played the occasional funeral. As a student, occasional became rather frequent because funerals usually happen at times most other people work - so the only organists available for such occasions are those who either work full time as an organist or those who do not work their main job full time.

It was the beginning of summer, outside temperatures already rather high, but inside of old churches it was still a little bit cold. During that time I played a funeral almost every week and I would usually do it between other things. Once I first went to work for two hours, travelled to the church, played the service, travelled to University and attended an evening lecture. The story happens at the beginning of summer, outside temperatures already rather high, but inside of old churches still a little bit cold. So I am on my way to yet another funeral, got dressed on autopilot, grabbed my notes and a cardigan because although we had 30°C outside, inside the church it still would be quite fresh.

I arrive at the village, get out of the train and just have to walk another five minutes to the church. From far away I can already see that there are already like 50 people standing outside the church.

Then it hit me. I got dressed on autopilot and the Shirt I wore had a huge ""Shit happens"" print. Walking through the crowd with that print? No way.

So I had a choice - either wearing the shirt inside out (and looking like an idiot who can't dress himself) or wearing the cardigan over the shirt (and looking like an idiot who wears a cardigan in blazing).

I decided in favour of the cardigan and it was awful, when I arrived at the church I was sweating like a pig. Luckily, I could slip out unnoticed after the service so I did not have to walk back wearing the cardigan again.

And the room went silent and everyone was looking at me. At the time I was thinking "" what the fuck did I just say"" and then it happend, someone leaned over and whispered in my ear, ""it's his son dude, he's autistic.

549,tifu,"Me and my best guy friend are both seventeen, and we have been really great friends since we were little kids. We know practically everything about each other, and have before sent our most personal secrets through text.

We both have a unruly crass and offensive sense of humor, as in we are both huge fans of shows like South Park and we talk dirty about cute guys with each other (he's gay, I am a bisexual girl, and we have similar tastes in men).  

The main problem that spurred my fuck-up is how strict my friend's parents are. He has parental controls on his phone that allow his parents to view his texts every week. 

I thought that if we just deleted the texts right after he received them, his parents won't be able to see the texts... 

...but unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

He told me that his parents noticed some of the crass and NSFW (usually of guys I thought he'd like) images and texts we sent on our phone. I am an artist as well, and they noticed the NSFW stuff I drew and shared with my friend and correctly linked it to me. 

My friend acted so scared around me when he admitted what his parents saw to me during school. He says if it happens again, his parents might take us to court...oops.  

I feel deathly embarrassed because I am afraid that the next time I meet his parents, they might have bad preconceptions about me now. He already emphasized that his parents ""don't think any different of me,"" but I am not so sure about his statement since his parents are quite strict. 

Hell, they don't even let him wear his hair too long or dye his hair due to bad preconceptions of guys with long or dyed hair.  

TL;DR I shared NSFW and crass images with my best friend, who has extremely strict parental controls and his parents found out about it.

550,tifu,"I was in my 4th period class when this happened. This is my python programming class, which is my favorite class since i like to program. Anyway, we were going to practice making images out of code (using the symbols on the keyboard). So the class decided to do patrick.

Naturally i struggled because i wasn't expecting the question, so in an attempt to make a joke, i went to say ""the boston tea party."". But the words that came out of my mouth were ""the boston massacre."". My teacher gave me this wide eyed suprised look.

Now, i didn't realize i had messed up until like a minute later when my friend gave me a wierd look and asked ""of all the things you could of said, you said a relatively recent terrorist attack?"".  At this point, i realized i messed up badly and said, ""i meant to say the boston tea party!"".

Me and my friend procceded to laugh histerically for the remainder of the class, and the teacher said nothing to me for the rest of the period.

I turn around and theres smoke barreling off of the pan and so I move it off of the hot burner it was currently on. Panicking and stressed with all of the fire alarms going off ,including one of them in the hallway, I grab the baking soda. I pour baking soda on the flaming oil and all of a sudden the flame grows to the ceiling (life tip: baking soda may work on oil fires but you have to dump a ton on it. Best idea is to suffocate the fire with a lid or another pan.) Fire alarms are still blaring flames are reaching my ceiling, smoke is filling up the apartment and I am full on panicking at this point. I grab the flaming pan off the stove and head for my balcony door. The pan moves a little bit as I'm rushing fir the door and splashes fire onto my carpeted floor. The floor catches fire but luckily goes out fast. I get the pan outside and run inside to grab the rest of the baking soda.

552,tifu,"So this happened about a month ago and it's took some reflection time for me to fully process what happened and to try and fully figure out what the fuck my thought processes were to make me freak out so bad. So this was my second time doing edibles (the first was literally the other half of this edible which still fucked me up pretty damn good but it was enjoyable none the less). So i really hadn't had much exposure to the brutality of weed edibles, I mean i'd heard stories from my pals that they hit differently but i always shrugged it off as ""Mehh how bad can weed really be"". Well I sure found out the hard way.

The night starts off in my room with my girlfriend, my parents are down stairs and as far as they are aware we are just having a quiet Friday night in. So I decide that I want to finish this edible and my girlfriend has no issue because she fancies having a drink so we both agree we are just going to watch some TV and have a good night (my girlfriend doesn't like the feeling of weed so doesn't touch it but has no issue with me getting stoned with her there).

So about half an hour later I start feeling the effects and I'm feeling pretty good, watching some TV and just generally enjoying the whole experience. However things start getting a bit weird, all the colours on the TV are morphing and my vision blacked out completely other than the TV so it was like nothing else existed. So after going through the motions I realise that things are getting a bit intense so i decide to take my glasses off and just stair at the ceiling for while and just ride it out until I felt better. Just for context I am blind as a mother fucker without my glasses, none of this short sighted/long sighted stuff. I have an astigmatism which basically means if normal vision is 1080p i'm rocking 360p at best.

Well let me tell you, I didn't know what had happened to my brain for that few minutes I was looking upwards but when i sat up i literally didn't recognise where I was or who I was. I sat up in bed and started looking at my arms and around my room and nothing seemed to make sense and everything seemed off. Even to the extent that I could see my nose in the inner corners of both my eyes and even that didn't feel like mine (I basically felt like my conscience had landed in a body that i didn't recognise and the room I was in was unfamiliar.) At this point I started feeling a little un-easy because i didn't know what was happening to me (keep in mind that if i literally would have just put my glasses back on I would have snapped out of it straight away) so I turn to my girlfriend for a bit of reassurance and this is when I started to really panic because i looked at her and didn't know who she was. 

The past 2 minutes of events basically rocketed me into a full blown paranoid panic attack at the thought that i was trapped like this forever and my perception on reality would be distorted forever, i started pacing around the room wondering how i was going to get out of this and if this would last forever. I decided to sit on my window ledge where it was abit colder to try and snap me out of it. This only made things worse by trapping my whole body in a constant shiver. By now my girlfriend had realised that I'm was really not doing to good and sat me on the bed to try and calm me down and slow down my frantic breathing. I looked at her as she was doing these breathing exercises thinking 'Is this a trap? Is she doing this to try and give me a lack of oxygen an kill me?', paranoia at it's worst I know but my mind was literally attaching to every bad thought and running with them. 

After the breathing techniques didn't seem to calm the storm I begin pacing around my room again thinking of all the bad things that were happening to me. And suddenly a realisation came into my head that maybe the chicken that I ate before the edible had made me ill and the reason i was feeling like this was because i was actually being poisoned by the chicken but i couldn't tell because i was high (don't ask because I literally don't know where that came from). So in my state of panic and helplessness i take myself to the bathroom and start forcing myself to throw up in order to get this chicken I ate out of me before it kills me. 

After throwing up I walk back over to my bed barely see my glasses that i left on the side table and slip them back on. I shit you not the second I slipped those fuckers on I snapped out of the whole thing and felt completely fine again. It was like the biggest weight had just been lifted off my shoulders and all of life made sense again. I felt so good that i lay back in bed and pretty much passed out straight away. I look back on this story and laugh but this was genuinely the most terrifying experience I've ever had and I have definitely under estimated the power that weed edibles have on your mind. I am not one to usually get paranoid on weed but this shit gave me full blown constant paranoia (Even if the whole experience could have been avoided if i would have just kept my damn glasses on -\_-)

553,tifu,"This just happened. I’m on mobile so punctuation might not be the best. My Aunt passed sometime before Dec. 20th. Her visitation thing was on Monday. Missed that cuz of work. Know this gets kinda confusing. The visitation and funeral (which was today) was on the same street, but it’s on a main st of the city where the street #s go back to the beginning again when you enter another city. I knew where the visitation was and in late dec knew where the funeral was but it’s Jan 15 and didn’t even think about it. Well, I go to where the visitation was on Mon. And no ones there. I panic. Another thing. When I panic I have the mind of a 6 year old. My mother posted a obituary on a text thread and when I was still panicking read the text seeing the address I figured I’d put it in gps and see where it was at.... 15 minutes away. Still panicking i start the car and head that way. Funeral started at 1 pm and I was to get there at 1:08. Mind you where I was going was kinda close to downtown to the main city. Thorough out this situation I texted my mother about wondering where everyone was? That was around 12:50. I finally get close to where my GPS took me. No parking whatsoever. I finally find a spot 4 blocks away park. Get out the car and like I take two steps and smh. This can’t be right. Let me take a look at this obituary again. Sure enough the funeral was just down the st. Of the visitation. I was dumbfounded how I could be so stupid. At this point I have a few emotions going on. Panic and just feeling stupid. I get back in the car and start heading back towards where I should be. Also this whole time no one has texted me wondering where I was. Know, another feeling kicks in. Why is no one texting me to see where I was. I called my mom two times. Of course it’s during the funeral but we have family outings all the time. Birthdays and such. No text from my sister. If she’s 5 min late I’m texting her seeing if things are ok. Nothing from her. So know I’m feeling like does anyone even care that I’m not there? Third emotion. By the time I get back on the freeway I’m thinking if no one texts me by the time I get back to the exit I need I’m just going to go home. Screw it. Half the funeral is over by now and I feel stupid and like non-exited. I pass the exit and about 20 secs later my mother texted me saying where it was. By that point I made up my mind to go home. My Aunt was really nice. I think she was a nurse back in the day and that’s cool. I feel bad about missing her funeral.

My ex-BF shared a house with some friends, everyone else's rooms were upstairs, his was downstairs in the hallway leading into the living room/kitchen. Therefore the nearest bathroom was the communal ""living room"" bathroom.

I was at his one night just chilling and hanging out, we had some lovely sex, after which I really needed to pee, and ladies, in general you should always pee after sex anyway. I was feeling too lazy to go get dressed since I knew I'd be getting right back to snuggling and we were the only ones home. With the wisdom of hindsight I now realise I jinxed myself by uttering the following sentence *""What are the odds of someone coming home in the next 2 minutes?"",*  he sealed the deal with his response: *""Slim to none.""*

So I took the 5 seconds to walk to the bathroom starkers and was mid pee when I heard the front door open, I waited a minute or two, hoping his housemate wouldn't hang around and go straight to his room. Of course, no such luck!! Housemate was with his girlfriend and they decided to chill on the couch and watch some TV. I looked around the bathroom, and in the cupboards, the only towels they had were hand towels which wouldn't protect the dignity of a hamster, let alone an adult woman. And of course, because I thought I'd be in there for literally a minute and right back into BF's room, I didn't have my phone with me to call or text him to come save me.

After what felt like an eternity but was probably only 2-3 minutes, there was a soft knock on the door followed by BF saying it was him and asking if I was OK. I opened the door as he threw my clothes at me. I swiftly got dressed, and raced through the living room - In that moment I would have given Usain Bolt a run for his money the speed at which I moved, I never even knew I could run so fast!

BF of course thought it was the funniest thing in the world, and confirmed that his housemates aren't idiots and would have figured out what was going on, meaning it was a few weeks before I felt comfortable entering their home again.  


**TL;DR** Home alone with ex-BF who had a shared bathroom off the living room, thought I could quickly run to pee after sex in the nip, got trapped in the bathroom until ex came to bring me clothes. Lesson learned!!",TIFU by going into the bathroom right after fun times with my BF
555,tifu,"For context I'm in middle school and 3 of my teachers give out candy still. 2 give out jolly ranchers. So I was having an addiction and bought a pack of jolly ranchers. Now as hard as the quote on quote hard candies are if you bite down on them and hold in that space they will stick to your teeth top row and bottom. And I loved getting them unstuck by moving jaw from side to side or pressing down really hard but u would have to have done it over your canines or something like that. Me being the dumbass I am did it over my 2 front teeth ONLY my 2 front teeth. I tried  getting it undone by moving my jaw couldn't move at all cause the rest of my teeth could barley touch the others to create a good grind. So I tried pushing down harder not enough strength. This wasn't the first time I knew I could have just waited so I did. But I was in class while doing this. And with my luck I got called on by my ass hole teacher who mocks you when you cant anwser if he calls on you. Now if you pull up and try to separate the merged rows of your teeth you can feel it in your teeth so typically you know to stop. Now he called on me and I through clenched mouth said wait a moment. But it sounded like way uh o-et. Now he starts his tangent/ mockery so I pull up fast and hard and BAM! My tooth pulls down with the jolly rancher still attached to the bottom row blood everywhere! I pulled out more the half my tooth and the nerve was dying and it was so painful! Long story short nerve died I had a replacement tooth and the dentist didnt do good at filling it in so now it's out of line a bit compared to the rest of my top row teeth getting it fixed in 2 days.

My roommate and I spotted a mouse this evening in our apartment. We chased it until it ran under the oven. Thinking we had it cornered, we sectioned off the area with a high wall of books and moved the oven to force it out. What we first discovered was two old poison traps against the wall. Thinking it couldn’t get any worse than that, we pulled the oven out the rest of the way and discovered an old glue trap with no fewer than three dead, mummified mice on it. Freaking out ensued. Landlords were called. Oven was pushed back into place until they get here to remove the trap, which is now stuck to part of the oven since we haphazardly moved it. I’ve lived here for 2 and a half years and never knew I was cooking my meals atop a graveyard of mice. RIP in peace, you nasty little mummies.

557,tifu,"Ok, so I'm a freshman at a public high school. My friends and I have a decent knowledge of computers and would occasionally mess around with them during classes or robotics club. One time, my friend revealed that he knew a way to create a local administrator account on a school computer. (I'm not going to say how because this counts as hacking and it's illegal). So me, my friend, and another friend decided to make these local admin accounts and install some game programs and other stuff. We weren't planning to do anything bad or illegal, and we figured we weren't hurting anyone.  At that time I didn't think that we were doing anything that bad and that it was just for fun.

Then eventually we got bored with that and started trying to think of other things to do with our new powers. Last Saturday, I don't know why I did this but I decided it would be a good idea if I disabled some of the Windows service applications on a computer, which turns out was not a good idea. Now looking back I realize that this was really stupid since I didn't even really know what I was doing, but at that time I honestly thought that wouldn't be much of a problem. And it seemed like nothing was wrong at first, except for the fact that the OS now looked like Windows XP. But other than that, the computer worked fine. But then me and my friends decided to try and fix it, and we managed to completely break it by accident. (Again won't specify how because this is a bad idea) Whenever we tried turning it on it just had this black screen and an error message. We decided to just turn it off and ignore it.

It seemed like we might be in the clear, but today, we all got called down to the associate principal's office. The IT department figured out that it was us behind the whole thing. We each got called down at separate times and were questioned. Then he called our parents and told us that we would be sent home and serve two days of in-school suspension starting tomorrow.

I'm glad that our punishment wasn't worse, but I am still worried about future college applications and other stuff. Does anyone know how something like this will affect my later applications?

I know this isn't very exciting compared to many of the other stories on here, but I thought I'd post it anyway.

558,tifu,"This happened two days ago, and though the consequences of said FU have subsided, the lessons I learned along the way will stay with me, forever.

I love bad food, and therefore have to run in order to eat said food without ballooning to immense proportions. On Saturday, I decided to do a long-ish run, as I was going out for my daughter's birthday, and her favorite restaurant is an all-you-can-eat place nearby our house. So, donning my cold-weather outdoor running gear, I set off on a jog, noticing that I had forgot to put on the compression underwear that I normally run with. No matter, I thought-I had sweats on and even though it was ~28 F, I was warm enough and knew that I would warm up after I started on the run.

About halfway through I had to pee, but it subsided after about 5-6 minutes, so I figured my body just said ""eh take care of it when you get home."" About ten minutes after that, I realized I could no longer feel much down there, and the tip of my penis was completely without feeling. Worrisome, I thought, so I turned my back to the road, took off my glove, and put my hands down there to investigate. It was cold as ice, and I couldn't feel anything. Turns out, not wearing underpants had made the tip of the penis spend most of its time in direct contact with my sweats, which weren't rated to any sort of weather conditions (they were just my usual ratty lounge pants). So, between the sweat from the warm parts of my legs and the tip of the penis being essentially uncovered to the elements...

I ran back to the house as fast as I could, all the while worrying that at some point that day, I would see a doctor, who would pull down his mask, use words like ""frostbite,"" ""amputation,"" and ""shockingly small,"" and I would have no choice but to be a eunuch. Once I got home, I stripped down and got into the bathroom to take a warm shower (I probably should have looked up the proper way to go about unfreezing a penis, but my mind was elsewhere). I cannot really describe the intense pain that ensued as my penis thawed, but I thought I was going to pass out. It took roughly an hour (the worst part of which was the first 5 or so minutes) to get ""normal"" feeling back, and as far as I can tell, everything is working properly as of now.

Still, the moral of the story- WEAR UNDERPANTS. They might just save your penis (if you have one).

TL:DR went for a run in below-freezing weather, forgot to wear underpants, froze penis, had to re-thaw penis and it was exceptionally painful.

Edit: I am so happy that my (possibly small) frozen penis is making some internet friends have a good laugh. Thanks for reading! And thank you, truly, for the gold and silver, I am honored that it made a few folks chuckle enough to go the extra mile. Stay safe out there, and keep your junk warm if you have it!

Edit edit: It's the squiggly line, not a minus sign, in front of the 28F. So, it was JUST below freezing, not 28 degrees below freezing. I don't mind running in the cold, but 28 below would be truly insane.",TIFU by freezing my penis
559,tifu,"This was just today. In school, we are not allowed bags. I always kept trying to use mine due to falling apart binders and whatnot and i finally gave in and bought a new one, we can’t have them because we can have a *GUN OR BOMB IN THEM* and thats not good.

Around a day after, I’m talking to him about how dumb it is I could have that stuff, and while it is a serious issue, I had no other way to carry stuff. Right then, me talking about having bombs in my bag became his go to everyday thing until today when a teacher yelled at him.

So today when I was getting my stuff on, he screams “I have a Gun” in front of a teacher. He was dragged down to the office for something, then I am told nothing until 9 pm. My buddy (who was conferencing with the principal on the phone) told me they told him that the kid that talks about bombs that i considered my friend said that we did that and more throughout prior years. That’s bull.

So now, I’m forced to write an email to not get this on my or my buddy’s record because now an investigation is going on. If this goes wrong and they say that I joked of bombs, then I guess I’m just screwed. And either way my parents are gonna ruin me if they find out about this, so no escape...

560,tifu,"Ok. This is 100% true, no joke.

Well, it all started when I had a crush on a celebrity back in high school/beginning of college. Feel weird even mentioning who it was, so Ill call her Shawnqueesha Jones. Shes was a quite low list celebrity at the time. A movie I saw her in was her first and I was like ""Oooh who's this girl, she's kinda cute.""

I look her up and find out this is Shawnqueesha Jones. First time acting etc. etc. I wasn't like madly crushing but enough to look her up. Then a year later, she was in another movie and she looked even better. I start looking up pictures of her constantly. Then again a year later, another movie and she's absolutely gorgeous and I just can't. I'm freaking out left and right. I look up more and more pictures of her. I even created a cloud storage account and downloaded mad amounts of pictures and videos of her. I almost used up all my storage. Every night I would go to my storage and stare at those photos for a long time even fantasizing about what it would be like to go out with her, make out, stare in each others eyes. Sometimes it made me tear up. It was the worst obsession I had. I would pray every night hoping that one day we would be together, get married etc etc.

It got to a point where, in college I thought that it was wrong to think another girl was hot because I just knew me and Shawnquessha were going to be together one day. Also one time I thought maybe instead of masturbating to porn I should look at pictures of her. That was just absurd lol.  I just had to figure out a way to make me and her together happen. Sooooooo I wrote a letter. I poured my heart and soul into that letter. It was the size of an average TIFU post. I wrote about how much I liked her and what she meant to me. I paid someone on Fiverr to write me a heartfelt poem and I added that to letter. I added art to the background of the letter etc. I sent it to her fan mail address, sent it to her on Twitter, I asked her friends to send it to her. None of her friends really responded back obviously. My life was a wreck thinking about it today.

She finally saw the letter on Twitter and she was kind of pissed because apparently my tweet with the letter on it was spammed to her multiple times. It definitely was not me, I only tweeted it once. ""Ok. Ok. I see it, I see it, whoever is sending this seems like the same person. It's a sweet letter but jeez stop spamming it."" She blocked the people who spammed it but not me.

I highly doubt she read it honestly based on her tweet or knew it was me who originally tweeted it.

I then found out Shawnqueesha just got a boyfriend ( a co star). I freaked when I found out. I was like ""asdgaksdakdahkd aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""

Ok, then I tweet to him randomly about a movie he saw and he legit goes off on me saying how I spammed his gf. and No I did not. He blocked me regardless. I created a second Twitter to prove him wrong but he blocked that too.

Anyway I was still mad pissed that he didn't believe me and the fact that she has a boyfriend.

It got kind of worse. I found a site that does live stream psychic readings. I paid for a private reading so that I can find a way to see if were going to be together one day.  The psychic says ""Most likely but if you want I can do a love spell on you two. All I need is a picture of her.  Apparently no charge.  I was desperate at this point. So I said OK. He sent me a video of instructions etc. etc. He did it and then said follow the instructions. Also said it takes a while for it to take effect. So I followed the instructions and waited. 2-3 weeks go by and nothing. I had a feeling it wouldn't work. I go back and contact him and he claims that he never did a love spell and that it's illegal.

Anyway I think he scammed me. Got my money back from the site though which is good.

It started winding down since she got more social media following and started realizing I had no chance but haven't ruled anything out though.

So go to the future at my high school reunion in the school gym. I offered to make a slide show of high school memories that would get shown on a giant projector. SOOO many people were there. I wasn't expecting that many. Friends of friends, some teachers for some reason.

So I gave a small speech and pressed play on my Bluetooth controller thing. Before you know it a video of the psychic's instructions show up on the screen.

""Ok John (me) I have prepared the love spell for you and Shawnqueesha Jones. All you have to do is light some candles in a circle and put the picture of her that you printed and a picture of you in the middle. Just say the......""

So my computer was at least 10 feet away and I RUN before the video ends and i'm like ""uhhhh, whoops wrong video."" I totally forgot I even had that video on my computer still.

I finally show the actual slideshow but afterwards EVERYONE comes up to me and is like WHAT THE FUCK DUDE. Did you join some cult. What was that???

I had to lie and say it was for a skit I was doing on Youtube. Their facial expressions definitely made it seem like they didn't buy my lie. Luckily it kind of stayed there and didn't really leave but I just wanted that day to end. I couldn't take the embarrassment and people asking what it was.

561,tifu,"Obligatory - this didn't happen today but rather last spring.  I received an email today reminding me of my stupidity though.


Last winter/spring I saw an email from my local liquor store for a promotion run by our state liquor commission giving away a bottle of Double Eagle Very Rare bourbon.  In case you don't drink bourbon I should tell you this is like the holy grail of bourbons.  I have never even seen it in person.  I would probably give my left nut for a bottle.  Getting one as a bourbon lover would be akin to hooking up with an A-list movie star and having video evidence to show your friends, not kidding. 


I went to the link and giddily entered my personal information.  Send.


I had completely forgotten about the promotion - because who wins shit anyway, I never do - when the guy from my local liquor store calls me.  ""Hey Pigeon, you're not going to believe this but you won!""  I knew the phone number and the liquor store guy so I knew it wasn't a scam but I was caught off guard and asked ""WTF did I win?""     


""The Double Eagle Very Rare lottery!"" he shouts.  ""Get down here and don't forget your ID!""


So at this point I'm literally shitting my pants.  I call my brother - who likes bourbon just as much as I do if not more - and tell him I won a bottle of Double Eagle Very Rare.  He thought I was fucking with him but I assured him it was legit.


I'm literally shaking as I walk into the store.  Everyone is there to witness the moment - random customers, the clerks I see every week, the manager, the owner.  They're all congratulating me like I just won a goddamn Oscar.  I walk up to the counter and I'm almost in tears.


Then the owner asks me for my ID.  Sure thing, here it is, I'd be an idiot to have forgotten that.  Check.


""OK, so how will you be paying?""  he asks.  


""I'm sorry, what?""  Thinking I misheard him.


""For the bottle.  Card?""  he asks.


""What?  How much is it?"" I'm starting to get really confused, my adrenaline is making everything foggy.  I must be misunderstanding his question.


""Just shy of $2,500"" he proudly exclaims, ""plus deposit of course"" he jests.


I felt the blood run out of my head.  And my hands.  and my legs.  I was feeling woozy all of a sudden.


""I thought I won?""  I asked, still in shock.


""You did, you won the lottery, a chance to buy this bottle! There's only one in the whole state and only a handful in existence!""  he proclaims.


At this point I'm dead.  I'm literally no longer in control of my body.  I went from ""winning"" an extremely rare bottle of bourbon to owing this dude $2500.  Plus deposit of course.


In maybe the only smart move I have ever made I ask ""can I have a seat in your office for a second, I don't feel so good"".  I needed to get this guy alone so I could explain the situation and not embarrass myself in front of everyone.  I am slowly coming to the realization that I had fucked up big time.


When we get back to the owner's office - he later told me he thought I had a wad of cash and didn't want to whip it out in front of everyone - I mustered the words to explain the situation.  He offered to hold it until I could come up with the money but I was in no financial position to spend $2,500 on a bottle of bourbon and told him so.  


""Well, we could do the transaction and make it look like I sold it to you but I would pay for it and keep it"" he said.


""You would do that for me?""  I asked, greatly relieved.  ""Sure thing!"" he said.


So, in the back room, he did the sale up, had me sign some shit, and took a record of my ID for the liquor commission.  He threw a boxed bottle of Woodford Reserve in a bag and said ""here, so no one out there is the wiser"".  I thanked him for the bottle and for letting me save face in front of the crowd out front.


I walked out to cheers, holding my brown bag high and proud.  Little did they know.


When I got back to my truck, feeling a lot like I had just been through hell and back, I had about 1,000 missed calls and texts from my brother wanting to know all the details.  I had to break the news to him.  


For those of you keeping score at home this is where my loving bro informs me of royal fuck up #2.  


""YOU DID WHAT?!?""  he screamed at me.  ""You fucking idiot!  Do you know how much you could have gotten for that?!?!  We could have easily come up with $2,500 and sold that thing for way more than that!""


Of course he was right.  Just google the bottle if you don't believe me.  We could have sold it for $5,000 and the buyer would have thanked us for the good deal.  Especially because we would have a pile of proof from the state liquor commission and the liquor store that the bottle was legit and not a fake.   


So there it is.  The story of how I majorly fucked up twice in one fell swoop.  


Except that's not exactly the last of it...


My brother tells me that I (and of course the owner) probably broke numerous laws by me ""selling"" him the bottle and me ""accepting"" a bottle for free in trade.  It may not seem like the end of the world but apparently the state liquor commission is pretty serious about this shit.  


The good news is that I don't think the owner told a soul about the transaction - probably because it was illegal - because every time I go in there the clerks ask me all sorts of questions about my plans for the bottle - ""you could get big money for that!"" - and act like I'm a minor celebrity.  


So I guess I have that going for me.



PS - there is another lottery this year - hence the email that made all of this come flooding back.  I'm thinking about entering.



TL;DR - It's dumb dumb time ladies and gents.  I ""won"" a rare $2,500 bottle of bourbon, ""sold"" it for a fraction of it's value, and probably broke a number of laws in the process.","TIFU TWICE (probably 3 times) by accidentally buying a very rare $2,500 bottle of bourbon"
562,tifu,"Spoilers for tomb of annihilation and dead in Thay ahead

  
So I've been playing DND 5e with my university friends for a few years now and last year I decided to start a new game as DM, being inexperienced I chose tomb of annihilation as its a challenging adventure and we are all pretty seasoned. Things go well for a while, but eventually the scheduling issues start arising and players are coming in and out of the game as we are doing a frankly boring and easy hex crawl. Enter my childhood friend, he hasn't played DND yet, but I figure we are just about to move on with the chapter and get to the action so I invite him, help him make a barbarian since that's pretty noob proof. A few sessions later we head into the tomb and I tell them this is really deadly and that, yes they WILL die. They all make extra characters at this point.

First death: childhood friend finds a potion and an urn, urn is cursed and deals him 2d10 for 10 turns (modified otto's irresistible dance and he cant make the save) the other players use up their healing to keep him from downing and right after the spell ends he drinks the potion of ~~supreme healing~~ poison, drops to 0 and fails his death saves. 

RIP Marcan Deschamps

Second death: he comes across a sharp metal door which he attempts do lift, nat 1, I read and deal the damage to him, he tells me he's down. Oops, if this trap reduces a PC to 0hp their head is lobed off. This was one week after the first death. (I let him keep his chacter but with a twist included in the module since resurrection is not supposed to be possible)

RIP Mar-curse Deschamps

Third death: they are separated in the elemental cells which are frankly unfair, you have only a few turns to figure it out or you die. He runs out of time in the earth cell and falls, in a meat grinder, 24d10, he is reduced to a fine pulp.

RIP Champagnard

He makes a paladin and they reach the final boss (a lich with 2 level 9 spell slots) and they are basically unable to die, they get enough temp hit points every turn to completely offset any damage dealt by the boss (even with an average of 3 levels of exhaustion left over by the previous fight) early on, the boss prevents childhood friend form gaining any more HP (doesn't affect temp hp so should be fine?). eventually childhood friend feels he has nothing to do during a turn, attacks a dear possession of end boss. 

Yeah he was locked at 40 something HP with 50 temporary hit points, I didn't expect him to actually die when I called out he was being power word kill, he died 4 times while there was only a single other death in the whole campaign

Rip Chambranlant  


Any how all of this is just a setup to understand the extent of my fuck up because once we were done with tomb of annihilation, I called out we were going to do some more prewritten adventures and decided that every player could DM their owl little part of them so I would have a chance to play. He is currently running dead in Thay, and I proofread it already. I know what lies at the end. A phylactery vault, much like the one where I power work killed him with a lich, close to the one I used. I see my end coming, all of this is going to go back to me, because I've known childhood friend forever, I know I'm not getting away from this Scott free. Can anyone cast death ward?

As one does when they feel bogged down by work, I took a 17 mile run through a ravine with my cell phone in hand. Naturally, this made the phone screen rather dirty, and through some professional level of stupidity, I washed it like a plate. **Dumbass counter: 1, my phone isn't water proof**

You would think this is the worst mistake I could make here, but buckle your seat belts because we're going on a roller coaster of dumbfuckery.

After submerging it for a few seconds I realized what I was doing and dunked it in rice for the next 30 hours. Taking it out the next day, I was concerned about the lithium ion battery, and after opening the back of the phone, it was soft and misshapen. **Dumbass Counter: 2, you need to wait \~50 hours for rice to work**

Thinking that I could replace the battery instead of buying a new phone, I ripped open the back of the phone, and the damage made it too difficult to take out by hand. **Dumbass Counter: 4, It was not recoverable at this point**

Grabbing the nearest thing, I used a metal fork to pry the battery out of the phone. A *metal* fork to take out a battery, something created specifically to produce electricity. **Dumbass Counter 5: Lithium ion batteries contain extremely toxic heavy metals, and puncturing the battery is the easiest way to release them, and can create hydrofluoric acid which will also kill you**

Because clearly I hadn't quite gotten a Darwin Award yet, I actually fucking punctured the wet lithium ion battery in the process of removing it. I knew that it needed to be discharged before disposing it, yet using the one thing I actually fucking knew about lithium ion batteries, I managed to check 4 out of the 5 boxes it takes to get a Darwin Award. Since a fully charged battery is a great way to start a fire, I shorted it by placing it in a sealed Tupperware container full of saltwater, planning to leave it overnight. **Dumbass Counter: Infinite, leaving it overnight would have left a hole in the building where my room used to be**

This began bubbling. Finally activating my last brain cell, I realized the lithium from the battery was reacting with the water, generating extremely flammable hydrogen gas. If this gas were ignited, by say a discharging battery, it would explode. Interestingly, a hydrogen explosion also caused the Hindenburg, and made a great Led Zeppelin album cover. Realizing this, I made my first good decision of the day by ripping off the lid of the container and ran to pour it down a storage drain outside my building. I'm still surprised my friend lent me his phone to call security after hearing this. Calling the building security to dispose of the battery immediately, and explaining the prior events of the night, this incident was taken off my hands.

Now someone is designated as nighttime removal service for my building.

I usually end up having my legs on my footstool and with one leg across the other. I had slept kinda bad the night before so I was a little tired during the day and eventually I fell asleep in my chair. I woke up a little while later and felt the need to go to the toilet. The short nap had made my head kinda foggy and when I tried to stand up I didn't realize that my whole right leg had fallen asleep. And not just a little, I had absolutely no feeling in my leg whatsoever. This resulted in me falling straight down with my face first into my desk. I managed to hit the edge of the desk right next to my eye and got a pretty decent cut.

While lying on the floor trying to figure out what the fuck had just happened I started to feel the blood pouring down my cheek. Had to stumble my way into the bathroom and I still kinda didn't know what was happening and eventually got the bleeding to slow down.

Today started out as a normal day.  I dropped my kids off at school and ran to the grocery store to pick them up some milk and other essentials.  While there I saw a bag of spicy chips that I like to munch on so I threw them in the cart.  Just before lunch I decided to have some while making myself a sandwich.  I mosey into the kitchen to grab them when I saw it.

I ate the first piece and felt a bit of heat but more of a burnt flavor.  Went ahead and ate the rest no problem.  I felt good.  The ghost pepper chips were worse.  


60 seconds later.... the burning started.  I quickly took the milk and all was good..... for 5 seconds.  For the next 5 minutes I had taken multiple glasses of milk (well after the 2nd one it was straight from the carton).  Multiple washing and spitting of water and a few slices of bread and the pain went down from a full burn to a simmer.  That wasn’t so bad... Lunch was no where on my mind any more, but I went about my day....

About an hour later my stomach started to feel weird.  Nothing like I need to go to the bathroom or I’m hungry more of a I ate too much.  But this feeling kept growing.  You know that Pain chart?  I was approaching BEES! quickly.  I ran to the bathroom and assumed the position.  Nothing was coming out though.  My body was going through the motions but all I got was some spit.  Sweat was dripping from everywhere.  So much on my forehead that it was dripping off of my eyelashes.  My shirt felt like I jumped into a pool.  Finally after about 5 minutes a small amount came up.  Then 10 minutes later most of the rest came out.  It was so bad my body actively refused to let me drink water.  I could get it in my mouth but I could not swallow.  Now that I got rid of it, the worst is over.... Or so I thought.


Now that the adrenaline was done my body let me know how angry it was with me.  I could not move.  It felt like a huge weight was sitting on my stomach and that weight was on fire.  I would have been happy to move down to the BEES! level of pain.  I dragged myself to the bed and just lay there unmoving for an hour.  Multiple times I thought about getting to a doctor, but I couldn’t move enough and no way I was going to call my wife to pick me up.

Finally the weight was lifted, but the damage has been done.  As I write this 10 hours later My stomach is still in pain, but more of a that hurts but I can deal.  I’m hoping it will be over in the morning, but considering what it’s done so far I’m not sure....

Here comes the problem. I decided to make coffee to drink throughout the day to stay alert, so I took my mom's vacuum flask and made my coffee. She got that vacuum flask from the dollar shop and I thought that it wouldn't seal the heat.
(I'm pretty sure you can see how this is going to turn out...) 

I poured my hot boiling coffee inside the cup and closed the lid. A few minutes later, I decided to drink a bit of coffee. I took a generous GULP.
MY TONGUE IS BURNING. 
PURE HEAT.
I panicked and swallowed the hot water. I felt the hot water burning through my oesophagus. For a second, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I ran to get some water and thankfully, everything turn out well.
Well, not really, my tongue still burns.
It's amazing how smart and stupid I can be sometimes.

567,tifu,"So my mother and a few of my aunties/her cousins hosted a gathering at one of Auntie 1's house, and since it was all girls, my mother dropped me off at my cousin's house which was not far from the Auntie 1's house. We're both 15. So because we needed money to buy snacks from the nearest Servo/gas station, we walked to Auntie 1's house because that's where our mums were.

On the way there I decided to call and inform my mother of my arrival and just as I was about to hang up I said, ""Crap! We're getting hit by a car! We're getting hit by a car!"" but in urdu. I then got a message from my mum asking if I was okay, I replied:  
""Sorry can't talk right now. Got hit by car""  
Now this is where any sane or normal person would've gone, *oh he's just joking*, my mum, being pakistani, didn't see it as a joke. So she told everyone at the gathering that me and my cousin got hit by a car, causing everyone to worry.

To make it look real me and my cousin started limping when the house was in sight, and that's when I realised I fucked up. When we got to the house, all aunties were standing on the porch, concerned and worried, and one auntie started to reverse her car to come look for our corpses. Realising it was a joke, all of them started yelling and screaming at us and my mum being the third oldest there and the paki, took charge and slapped me in front of all the aunties. When asked whose idea it was, I tried to split the blame but my cousin was having none of it. So we left... and realised we forgot the money, we turned back, got humiliated again, took the $40, went to the servo, bought chips and drinks, went home and watched *Daddy's Home.* Now I have a massive stain on my reputation as ""the good boy"" of the family and all those aunties think me a dickhead.

I am recovering from the full blown flu. I haven't eaten anything in three days. My angelic wife brings home dinner of which she gets me a warm bowl of burgoo chili which is about the only thing I would probably keep down. Well the restaurant gives her a small container that holds two round green sliced peppers about the size of a quarter each. I L-O-V-E hot sauce. I eat jalapenos raw without consequence. Outside of the ghost pepper, I do not think there is a pepper I haven't tried that did not burn me. 

I sit down on the couch, open the little container &amp; pop one of these quarter sized devils hemorrhoids into my mouth &amp; began to chew. Within the first few SECONDS of chewing, the burn in my mouth &amp; throat equal the intensity of a thousand white hot suns. Screaming in pain, I reached for my YETI &amp; started gulping down whatever was in the container. It was water; which is the WORST thing you need to drink when you have fourth degree pepper burns going on. The pain intensifies causing me to scream like a little girl, snot came pouring out of my nose, &amp; ugly face crying. My wife comes running into the family room just as I blaze past her to the kitchen. I open the fridge, grab the gallon sized jug of milk &amp; start chugging like an extra on a Rocco Steele movie set. Around the fourth gulp the rancid after taste hits me. I pull the jug back &amp; look at the expiration date. January 4th. Today is January 14th. 

I run over to the kitchen sink, turn the jug upside down &amp; start to heave into said sink - which brings back up the pepper juice in my stomach now burning my wind pipe. Oh. God. Please. Let. Me. Die. Now. Just about then, the wife hands me a container of yogurt &amp; that takes care of everything. I am able to breath again. I can taste again. The crisis is over.

After I regain my composure, I grab the gallon sized milk jug to place it in the recycle bin. Since it is a gallon sized jug, I need to squish it. So...I hold it next to my chest &amp; using my hands, squash the jug against me. I did not know the jug had not emptied out. The remaining spoiled milk spewed all over my face, hair, &amp; eyeglasses like a volcanic eruption. Did I mention I had just had a shower before trying to eat?

My finances have been stretched pretty thin the last week but tomorrow is payday and I checked my account to see that I still had about $16 in there (I’m bad with money but I’m *working* on it ok) so anyways, I decided that after a stressful day I’d get myself dinner from Taco Bell. I also needed gas, so I figured $7 worth of gas, to last until tomorrow, and that leaves me $9 for Taco Bell, which is plenty! 

So I go to Taco Bell, but before I go inside, I take a few hits off of my dab pen. So I get pretty high. I eat my Taco Bell which was only about $6, and then I go out to my car, to get gas and go home. But I got distracted by reddit and Twitter, and didn’t leave right away. Then I was like “why am I still sitting  in the car? I should go eat!” So I went into Taco Bell again, order my usual for about $6 and sit down to eat. That’s when I realize that this seems familiar. I then realize that I’m an idiot and just bought $12 worth of Taco Bell for NO REASON except that I got high and forgot I already ate. So now I have ~3 left for gas, which is barely a gallon 🙃

I don't know why but my eyes zoned in faster than the rest of me and I noticed a shape in front of me. It was almost transparent but just opaque enough to be visible. My brain made an instant unconscious decision to focus my eyes and the shape got clear looking just like a silhouette. I knew it was mine because it had the same shape as me. Even the hair. My body almost completed zoning in as I freaked out. My breathing suddenly stopped and I thought I was going to die when I suddenly realized what it was. It was a shadow. My shadow. There was a light behind me. I mentally slapped my head and scolded myself for being so stupid but from now on, I can't see my shadow without wondering if it's alive and that kinda tickles my fear centre.

I started a second part time job whilst off from college where a family member works. Without getting into too much detail, I basically do recess aiding and generally watching the kids and helping with the games outside.  I do grades 3-6, but this horrible incident happened with the sixth graders. 


I’ve only been there for like, two weeks, not even.   There’s this girl there who I’ll call “A”. 

Now, these kids are pretty rambunctious. Kids at this school in particular can be rough and rowdy, and they’re well know for screwing with the recess aids and pulling all kinds of shit to make you look dumb. 

So anyways, A is running around with, what appears to be, her elbow sticking out of her jacket.  The other arm was out, and her and other kids were chasing each other on the blacktop.  I called out to her in front of her group of friends to stick her arm back out, as I didn’t want her to fall and face plant. I foresaw a broken nose/facial bones. Plus the black tops kinda slippery. 

A; “I can’t” 


Me; “why? You’re going to hurt yourself” 


(Her group of friends, watching); Ms. C, that’s really mean 


Me; I don’t want you guys to get hurt, that’s all 


A; I only have one! 


Me; alright guys, don’t joke. Come on, you’re going to get hurt. 


A looks at me, red, and pulls out the stub from her jacket. 


I am mortified. I profusely apologize. I immediately ran inside and talked to the vice principal whom I’m really close to about it. Luckily, A laughed it off and accepted my apology.  The kids had a laugh at my expense, but holy shit did I fuck up today. I’ll be thinking and cringing on this one for quite some time.

572,tifu,"The events of this occured this morning (15 Jan 2020)

So I live in Iowa where we get an interesting plethora of weather situations. Last night called for freezing rain and my car (2005 Nissan Maxima) is typically parked outside.

I start my morning routine as usual, and leave the house a few minutes early to allow for my car to warm up and scrape the windshield. Car starts fine as usual, and I grab my scraper from the trunk, NBD. 

My car has been having an electrical issue where the doors will randomly lock themselves as I'm driving down the road, or sometimes just sitting in traffic. Haven't figured out how to fix this yet, so I've been a little cautious as to not get locked out of my car. 

I get all the ice off my windows, throw my scraper back into the trunk, and close it. Walked to the drivers side to leave for work and my door would not open. 

Shit. 

Must have locked itself as I was scraping. Never having been in this situation before, I reach for my phone, but realize that it's inside of the car. 

Shit. 

Luckily I'm home, so I run inside, jump on my computer, and message my boss about the situation. While I'm there, I YouTube some quick guides to get into a locked car, but unfortunately for me, none of those tactics would work for me. As my door wasn't closed all the way, I had no knob to grab onto, I couldn't slide a loop over my door handle since the design didn't allow for that, and I wasn't fitting anything down between the window and the door. 

To make a long story short, I eventually found a sturdy enough piece of wire to finally be able to push the button to unlock my door, and made it into work an hour late.

This happened yesterday.

I cooked beef pinwheels for dinner, everything went fine. Me and my girlfriend ate, put the left over in the fridge and went to our room to watch netflix. Unfortunatelly, I forgot to throw away the strings that keep the pinwheels together and my GF's cat quickly noticed it... He ate all of the strings I left on the table (like 4 strings), but we didn't know at the time as we were watching netflix and went to bed afterward.

The next morning, my GF got up to go to the bathroom and noticed that the cat puked on the bathroom floor. The strings where in there. The cat looked fine and she said that she'd call the vet if the cat started to feel dizzy or something. We then cleaned the mess and went to work.

Fastforward to this evening, when I came back from work. I got in the appartment as usual and went to the bathroom and then I smell something odd... When I got there, I saw shit all over the floor and I didn't understand how it happened until I saw the cat. Turns out that he didn't puked all the strings in the morning, so one of them went the natural way in his body and came out as he took a dump... But not completely, it was still there, dangling from his asshole, covered in shit, and he dragged his ass all over the floor to get rid of it... There were patches of shit all over the appartment.

I ended up get the bar out and he was so excited, cause I was really struggling, he came up to me said good job and put his hand up for a high five. Now for some god damn reason instead of laying a meaty five on him I went to hold his hand, instead of speed I went real slow just to savour the cringe. 

He ended up dodging my forceful act of affection and slid down my arm to pat me on the shoulder. I was, and I am, mortified. The awkwardness was so obvious for the both of us. The cherry on top, instead of just going past it and forgetting it together like we should, i whimpered out a measly “sorry”

I was a junior in high school and I had started dating a girl. As teens tend to do, we started exploring each other. Also as teens tend to do, we had no tact. 

I convinced my gf to sneak out of lunch and give me a bj in this area near the gym. It was freshly mulched and behind some bushes, so it's hard to see. I drop my pants around my ankles and she starts awkwardly doing her best. 

Just then, I hear the doors to the gym open and the gym class all start coming outside to use the fields. In a panic I go to hide better. I trip over my pants and fall. Dick first.

From what we have pieced together is that he wanted to make his dick harder and bigger ? So naturally we busted out the rubber bands to make a makeshift cock ring. This is clearly when things went awry.
At this point we were beyond blacked out and I assume we passed out. 
So heres were it gets good, I woke up this morning and my dudes like freaking the fuck out.

Several months before I was shipping out to boot camp, I was still living the civilian life. This included my having hair and regular visits to my local barber. I sat down in my barber's chair and normal barber shop talk commenced. Judging by the conclusion of our short conversation, I have concluded that the conversation must have gone something like this:

him: ""When are shipping out?""

me: ""At the end of the summer. I'm wondering if I'm just going to shave my head myself before I go.""

him: ""Do you want me to do it?""

me: ""Yeah.""

I got up quickly and saw my phone who had fell of my pocket right into the bowl FULL OF PEE. And it’s not mine. So I reached with my hand in the pee to get my phone and I put it on some toilet paper while I sat to pee, feeling very disgusted. What I didn’t realize was that I splashed some pee on the seat when I pulled my phone out. So after I realized it I hurried and got up. At this point I couldn’t stop gagging. I had pee all over my phone and my butt. I washed both of them (and the seat), my phone with rubbing alcohol and I even washed my hands with burning water. And of course my whole family was there so I had to act like nothing happened when I got out. My phone is still working but I don’t feel comfortable holding it.

So I have never consumed marijuana. I do however regularly use hemp flower (cannabis plant with 0.3% or less thc so not enough to get high). So i got home from school and had a couple hours to kill and remembered that i had some hemp infused butter i had made a few weeks prior.

Fuck up #1: i melted about 1/3 of a cup of pretty strong cannabutter into some hot apple cider and chugged it (I've never had this much at one time). 

Fuck up #2: I didnt notice any effects of the butter for what I thought was a long time and started causally vaping some cbd.

Fuck up #3: I began to get sleepy but I had a kinda long day, so I didnt think much of it and decided to take a nap.

Fuck up #4: I turned on a white noise channel on spotify and put it on repeat.

So at this point I doze off and I began having what I thought was a lucid dream (I had never had one before). I felt as though I was aware of things around me but there was a delay between things happening and being able to feel them. I thought I was still dreaming when I heard something that woke me up and i stood up, and i was standing there for a few minutes waiting for the nap fog to evaporate so i could think clearly. 

Around this time i noticed that i was feeling extremely peculiar and i could not think of an explanation for it. I felt like I was in my house but it was too quiet and everything seemed slightly hazy.

All the sudden I think that at school today someone must have put something in my drink and i had died in my sleep because of it. I walked through the house kinda looking for any evidence that i was dead but didnt find anything. 

So, at this point I'm about 50% sure that I'm in purgatory and if I fall back asleep I'll cease to exist. I was so unsure of my own existence I was desperate to hear someone tell me I wasnt actually passing into the great beyond.

I decide all i can possibly do is call my wife. I send her a text asking if she can call because she is at work. She calls and I ask if I'm ""real""  several times trying to explain my problem. She tries to calm me but I became concerned she was actually satan or some equally  evil  critter trying to get me to let go of my old reality and move on to a new plain, maybe hell. But I wasn't ready to stop living yet and everything seemed like a trick to get me to go quietly. 

She was concerned that i may have had some kind of nervous breakdown because it is not characteristic of me at all to act this way.

I ask her to leave work early because I thought maybe I was having a stroke or something that was causing me to have some sort of disassociated out of body episode. 

She gets home sits me on the couch and looks in my eyes and all the sudden says ""Dude, you're fucking high..."" She reassured me I was ok, had me start drinking water, and had me eat something.

Yeah I apparently took a fuck ton of concentrated hemp flower extract that when taken in huge doses apparently has enough thc to make me high.

It's July, I'm chilling before my first day of work at a new job. I order pizza, because yay! New job! And start tidying up and gather the recycling into the bin we use to take it down to the collection bin (live in a townhouse and the kitchen is on the middle floor). Pizza shouldn't be here for another \~20 min so I've got time to run down and take out some cardboard, right?

I'm in a sundress and barefoot because it's summer and the bin is 10 feet from our front door, in the driveway. Now, there are 3 steps leading up to our front porch + door, so the porch area is about three feet off the ground. I don't know what chucklefuck designed this place, but there aren't any railings even though it's kinda steep. 

So I've got this bin (think those plastic storage totes) with cardboard in it. It's not heavy, and I just quit a job as a shipping manager where it was literally my job to pack and carry and move boxes all day. So taking out the recycling is nothing, right?

WRONG.

I miss *all three steps* and land on my left foot. I feel and hear a crunch. I don't know what's happened, for a few seconds, because I've never broken a bone and never fallen that far before. The cardboard goes flying. My next door neighbor sees me hunched over, bleeding (skinned my knee and ankle) and just carries on to his car like an asshole. Luckily, I've got my phone in my dress and am able to call my fiance, who was sleeping before a graveyard shift (at the very hospital we ended up going to), that I fell and can't get up. Idk what would've happened if I didn't have my phone, because I was NOT able to move on my own.

Since it's July, it's like 90 degrees , I'm dizzy and in pain and faint, but my fiance manages to drag me back into the house into the entryway so they can get dressed and then get me to the hospital.

Pizza shows up as this is happening, of course. My BFF, who I live with, signs for it and just tosses it somewhere. I'm still trying not to pass out, bleeding, in my sun dress, worrying about the fact that I'm supposed to start a new job tomorrow morning and stressing how that is *definitely* not going to be happening now.

Fast forward a few hours and I'm x-rayed (the xray tech was like ""I'm not supposed to say anything about the images but you won't be walking for a while) and in a boot and on pain meds, finally.

i'll admit my porn tastes are not 'normal' or 'healthy' for that matter, but to each their own as long as no one gets hurt

but, it turns out today my landlord got fed up with these notifications (which i didn't know he was getting) and decided to find out what was causing it, it being my computer and laptop. turns out, that a lot of the porn i use has a lot of well unsolicited ads, malware, etc. (never click on'em but you know that rly doesn't matter)

welp, my landlord texted me pictures of the sites i frequent after letting me know i should ""be more careful"" and i just can't get over it. my landlord now knows i've been jerking off incessantly lately (honestly due to my depression, i swear) and he's been getting notifications of my uh, indecent websites.

584,tifu,"Currently writing about 5 minutes after said event. If anybody has seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre they'll know what it's like right now.

I'm a student and as students do, our best club nights are during the week. My night of choice is Tuesdays when they play cheesy music and the drinks are cheaper. As with any night out there is a chance that you may get with somebody. In preparation of said eventuality (despite being HIGHLY unlikely) I decided to have a shave in the ol' nether regions before hitting the town. It had been a while since I'd *ahem* landscaped, so I decided a good first step would be to use my electric razor to tame the bush before I went at it with my Gillette. I should at this point add that I have already consumed about four cans of fairly strong French lager.

This is where said FU occurs, as I'm sure all people with a penis will know, down there is full of loose skin. As I'm going about skimming the tops off hairs I decide to pull my dick to its full length and run the clippers down to get all the hairs growing at its base. If I were sober there is a chance that I would not have been so brazen with a tool of circumcision such as this, but c'est la vie. As I'm doing this, however, a bit of loose skin gets caught in the reciprocating blades of my razor, turning the normal buzz of the motor into something more of a groan. Being drunk, my reactions are much slower and when I start to feel pain I instinctively yank the whole razor away from my dick as fast as possible, taking with me a piece of skin about the size of a grain of rice. The pain was immense and the blood even worse. Paper cuts are bad enough but this is in an area with A LOT of blood supply. I quickly try to bring the rest of the hair under control before I pass out from blood loss but the whole right side of my penis is a lot untidier than the left. I'm currently sat with tissue on my dick in a manner a lot less fun than usual. Mind the loose skin, kiddos.

585,tifu,"Today I decided to make falafel for the first time. After I was done, I had a bunch of dishes to wash so I stuck everything in the dishwasher.

The problem is that I'm Latina, so even though my family has a dishwasher, we don't use it for washing dishes. Instead, we wash dishes by hand and put them in the dishwasher to dry. In the 8 years we've lived in our house, my family has used the dishwasher maybe a dozen times. I had only used it once, so obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to dishwashers.

I come back after the dishwasher is finished and discover my error. I forgot to rinse off the dishes I had used to make the falafel. Instead of washing the dishes, the dishwasher picked up all of the leftover falafel bits and sprayed them all over all of the dishes and the inside of the dishwasher. The dishes came out dirtier than when I'd put them in.

I had to take out all the dishes and the dishwasher racks to clean out the inside of the dishwasher and all the dishes had to be washed by hand. In the end, the ""slower"" way of washing the dishes would have been faster.

So I (21M) was being visted by my girlfriend (19F) who had just come back from a long trip. Understandibly so we were very excited to see each other, so much so that other things fell out of our minds. After a while of fooling about we decided to get under the shower, you know... to get squeaky clean. This was just before 1pm and I hadn't really seen any clock or time for a long while. During our attempted shower I heard a noise and looked out of the shower where I saw my bathroom door opening, a blurred face of a woman peering in and immediately shutting the door in her understandable surprise.

Both of us were instantly dying of embarassment but also laughing histerically. I don't know if I feel bad for us or the woman who had to go out and explain to multiple potential tennants that they cannot view the house right now because two people decided to fool around in the shower for too long.

587,tifu,"This happened yesterday. We're both adults in our 30's. Well. Technically adults. My fiance and I went to the local liquor store and while browsing I found a bottle of Jaegermeister, I had memories of making Jaegerbombs back probably five years ago and decided to ask my fiance if she'd be up to try them. She's always open to new things so we bought the bottle and went home.

Sitting down at the dining room table I make two of them and we each take a shot. Or rather, I take a shot and she sips hers. I decide that this cannot stand and I pour us each another before demonstrating how to actually do a shot. Quick. Smooth motion. No sipping. She gets a quarter down that way and then resumes sipping the remainder. This continues until we've each had five and then we decide to go play some Stardew Valley. Returning whenever it seems like continuing the lesson won't make us both sick. Each time I try to remind her of the technique.

 The first sign I got that she was affected was when she noticed two ladybugs in our washroom and started telling me that we should take care of them. She then asks our google home how long ladybugs live and after hearing 2-3 years she begins telling me how they'll be great pets.

This of course gives way to dancing and singing loudly out of key. The dog finds this concerning as this is not a regular occurrence but he calms down when nobody dies. A couple more shots are consumed.

Now reader, in all this excitement I kind of lost count. Did we stop around ten or did we get to almost fifteen shots? All I knew was I was feeling lucky.

I however realised it had been too many when mid conversation she began leaning against my chest with her face for support. She insisted she was fine. Or at least she muttered that she was fine into my chest.

Minutes later I was in the washroom holding her hair back. Thankfully she was not sick but she felt terrible about being taken care of and her guilt eventually lead to crying. I told her it was okay and that I love taking care of her when she hit me with this great line.

""The ladybugs. I don't want them to see me like this"".

I stowed this thought away for later teasing. Searched through the kitchen and found a sippy cup which I filled with water and thrust it into her hands.

We stopped. But eventually she got to the point where she could do half of the shot properly. Still room for practice I suppose.

I sat in my beautiful one-room apartment - of course, completely naked - having a bit of a good time with myself.

Since I am in for a good time with myself but not a long one, I got up immediately after I was done. I went to the kitchen to quickly check on the food. Still completely naked and about 15 seconds after I was done with myself.

One of the designers we work with refuses to come to headquarters (where I work) unless it’s absolutely necessary or she’s forced. I missed her last visit (I was on medical leave), so I’ve worked with her for over a year and have never seen her in person. She’s not popular with the rest of the team, because she always does the bare minimum, is super defensive to feedback, and won’t listen to other ideas outside of her skill set. I feel like there’s an opportunity to let her go and get someone else onboard, and I think that feeling is shared.

I recently got promoted, so I’m supervising writers and learning design so I can eventually be a creative director. I’ve been asked to give feedback on her work, and I’ve been saying to multiple people, “I just don’t think she has the eye for design outside of the basics.” I have said that many times, including to the chief marketing officer.

Today we started doing our weekly team meetings via video chat, and my heart dropped when I saw her. She’s horribly cockeyed. Like probably a 90 degree angle between where her two eyes are pointing. It’s a miracle she can design ANYTHING. I feel horrible. I hope my feedback never reaches her.

I sing loudly “is this looovvvee, and be loooovveed, dooo do do do” the mc laughs and says “ try it again “ so i go “is this looovvvee, and be loooovveed, dooo do do do”. Yes, I sang the “dooo do do do” both times. The mc laughs and i win a wood carving and a t shirt. As I walk away the MC makes a funny comment about how horrible of a singer I am.

The story starts when I had a friend who was autistic and I was weird so he was one of my only friends. I had an interest in criminals and had a dark sense of humour so on this particular day, I woke up, put on uniform, normal morning routine. But I had an idea, I would grate salt into a sandwich baggie and pretend it was cocaine to pretend I was a criminal on the playground(Like in PD2 one of my fav games at the time). My autistic friend walks up to me and asks: ""What's that"" I grin and tell him it's coke. He tastes it and said: ""it tastes like salt"" I replied with: ""because it is"" but he must not have heard me. A few days before, we had an assembly on drugs and how you feel depressed after so you want more. He came to me the next day and said: ""I'm addicted now I'm feeling depressed and told my mum"" I said ok feeling scared shitless inside. I get called to the principal and confess all of it that I didn't mean any harm and learnt about drugs from THEM and that it was just a joke. They called the police and they said it's not worth the time and to call social services.(did I mention my dads a social worker and could get fired cause of this?) They called social services as I sweat there and my dad picks up! He gets me a less harsh punishment then sat me down that night to talk things out. He said I have a dark sense of humour but that is never an appropriate joke especially on someone with autism.

I was a rehearsal when my fiancée called me and asked 

F: why is there a different condom in the bathroom trash can?

Like, those were her first words to me. 

Naturally I had to excuse myself to answer her, because I wasn’t about to air my life out in front of the others. I knew exactly what she was thinking. “He must be cheating on me”. So I answered her.

Me: I couldn’t find the Astro glide after you hid it, or threw it away, or whatever you did with it, so I used a condom”

F: why didn’t you just do it in the shower or wherever else you do it, then? That doesn’t make any sense!

Me: Fine you wanna know the whole truth? I couldn’t find the Astro Glide so I used the condom on your dildo, and I, uh, did butt stuff with it. And that’s the truth. 

And that was actually the truth. Earlier I used it on myself, and I wish I just had the Astro Glide itself! After that we had a long conversation about me not actually cheating, and what I was really doing. I’m not gay or bi, I’m a straight cis male who happens to enjoy butt stuff every now and then. 

Now we’re fine, she was actually laughing and trying to make jokes about it after everything cooled off. I’m not a weirdo, am I?

So this happened when I had practice on the same day as a basketball game and I heard that my old friend (who I havent seen in a few years ) was my playing my schools team so I decided to skip a little part of practice just to watch the game and say hi to my old friend.
 So I go to the game and by the time the game finished I had done all that I wanted and headed to practice (only 45 minutes in by the time I was in). As I show up my coach starts chewing me out for being late in front of everyone (It gets worse) and once hes done I go to get dressed in the Locker room. When I come out I go to my friend (We'll call him F1) so F1 tells me that the one other guy in my weight class got my spot and I get confused but shrugged it off as a joke. During the whole practice I kept my mouth shut to be sure I didnt anger my coach anymore than he already was, so at the end of the practice he lists the varsity roster for the week's tournament and as he gets to my weight class I dont hear my name but I hear the one other kids name.

595,tifu,"Obligatory didnt happen today, but in november.

Let me start off by saying I (17m) am horrible at buying gifts for people. I try my best and ask for suggestions and usually it turns out okay. I wanted to do something special for my parents this year, so I gave my mom about $150 to go for a bug ticket item for my dad. I had no idea what I should get her though, so I ask my dad what she wants and he said ""there's a specific perfume she likes called summers eve, she will love whatever scent you get her."" 

Perfect!

The next day I pull up to Target in search of this perfume. I rsn into one of my friends (also 17m) and asked if he had any idea where this was. He did not, but I bring this up because it's important later. I find it eventually, but I did not pay attention to the aisle where I got it. 

I go back to my friend and show it to him. We both tame smells of it and agree its good perfume.

Awesome!

I proceed to go to check out. I leave Target with my bounty and head home to wrap it and wait for christmas. Christmas comes and I hand my mom the present, excited to see her face light up as she sees her perfume collection. Instead what I get is laughter. Our convo goes like this.

Mom: Rawalfredo, do you know what this stuff is?

Me: yeah, its perfume, dad said it was your favorite

Mom: no, this is douche

Me: whats douche? Is it a kind of perfume?

Mom: no, girls spray it to stop their vaginas from stinking

596,tifu,"Obligatory this happened a few months ago. Let me lay down some background for you. My family is very religious, to the point that men don't even wear jewelry (i.e. gold necklaces, earrings, etc.) and woman should almost always be wearing skirts of some sort when out in public. I grew up that way but I have relaxed quite a bit from all of those beliefs, especially the more restricting ones. As of late I have been living more of a... man-floozy lifestyle. I now live on my own a few hours away from my family (which helps my lifestyle) but I still go back pretty often to visit them, since my mom hasn't been doing the best health-wise. Because I live in an apartment I almost always have things that I order on Amazon delivered to my parents house. They are pretty good at not looking in boxes that don't have their name on it so it's been fine. 

Now here comes the fuck-up. Because of my lifestyle I get seen naked pretty often, so I try to keep myself looking good and appealing. I ordered on Amazon an Intimate Skin Whitening Cream. I chose a brand that I have never used before to try it out and see if I liked it better than the one I already used. I use it because my armpits and inner thighs get really dark no matter how hard I scrub in the shower. The item comes to my parents house and they put it in the room that I use when I stay there. I got it, used it, worked pretty good, everything was great. Then about a month later I get a postcard in the mail from the company that I purchased. It was sent to the same address. The postcard had a medium-sized picture of what I ordered and a letter from the owner of the company saying something like ""Thanks for your purchase of our product BdonLangs. Here's 25% off your next purchase"". The next time I went to my parents house I saw it on my bed and my jaw dropped. It is so obvious what I purchased and I know my parents saw it. 

I did the only thing I could think of and brought it to my parents and said ""So, I'm sure you have questions about this"". My loving mother played dumb but my dad was like ""Yes, what is that?"" (he has no chill whatsoever LOL). I explained about my underarms and legs and that was that. Ever since this instance, however, they have been calling me a lot more often, and seeing how I'm ""doing"". Combine this with the concealer that my mom found that I had purchased to hide a hickey that a girl gave me, I'm pretty sure my parents think that I'm either gay or I work the street corner for some extra money. It's easy to say that I'm never going to purchase anything from that company again.

597,tifu,"So I'll start off the story with some context. Please bear with me and read through the story without just jumping to the tl;dr.

Growing up, I used to be quite close with my dad. He was an old man (my mom was his second wife), and I always felt like this made him a bit more childish in some of his behaviors. Sometimes he would get mad at me for things and give me the cold shoulder for days. As a kid, I wasn't sure what to do to get him not to be mad at me. As I grew into my teens, we had a few bigger cases of these fights, and this caused us to start to drift apart. I was also slowly becoming more individualistic, perhaps as a defense mechanism against some of this. Altogether though, my dad generally had good intentions and was dutiful to his fundamental responsibility as a parent.

My brother, on the other hand, was always the closest with my dad. Compared to me, he was less individualistic and more traditional. He always held on to his values much more tightly. In particular, he had a deep loyalty to the bond between him and my dad. I always felt he was stubborn, but I can now see that there is something quite admirable about his character.

So I suddenly remember that it's my dad's birthday, and I don't have a present for him. My dad really liked the song ""Danny Boy"". You'd always hear him whistling it every now and then. Somehow the idea of playing that song for him on the piano was implanted in my head. It felt like throughout the day, I was vaguely hearing that song in the background.

As I'm scouring the internet for a good piano arrangement of that song, the door opens behind me. It's my brother, and he's playing Danny Boy for my dad on the violin. He plays the most simplistic version of the song, just the pure melody, and it is tearfully beautiful.

What I had actually been hearing were the fragments of him practicing this song for my dad. As he finishes, the my dad opens up for a hug, and my brother and him share a warm, loving embrace. I ask my brother how long he practiced that song for, given that he had never had any violin or musical training, and he tells me ""500 hours"", and my eyes start to water.

I wake up in my bed. It was a dream.

All of the backstory is true - everything except for my brother actually playing the song for my dad. The truth is that my dad passed away from a heart attack over a decade ago when I was a teenager, and it was devastating for my brother. I have always wondered if he's fully gotten over it.

I was completely shaken up when I woke up. I literally laid there staring at the ceiling in bed for god knows how long, just reflecting on my life and the values I had chosen. I never really talk about or share my dreams, but this story was so real and poetic at the same time, I just wanted to share it with someone else.

TL;DR - I forget my dad's birthday, and have the idea to play ""Danny Boy"" for him on the piano. It turns out I had the idea because my brother, who is not musical at all, had been practicing Danny Boy on the violin to play for my dad on his birthday. He plays for my dad and they share an embrace. I wake up from the dream.",TIFU by forgetting my dad's birthday
598,tifu,"First off, apologies for format, on mobile. TL;DR at bottom

Obligatory “this didn’t happen today” but in fact it happened 5 days ago.

It was Friday, the last day of my work week, and I got up for my morning job for a certain car rental company (think “Kirk to...”) my wife is asleep in bed next to me, but wakes up at my motions to say goodbye. When she rolled over to get comfortable again, she fluffed the covers and in doing so, exposed her ass. Have you ever had one of those moments, either being male or female (or NB) and you just see your partner in a certain light or angle and think “yeah I could totally go for some of that right now”? Well lo and behold, that was me at 6:40am as I was about to walk out the door.

I get to work and it’s a typical Friday: Johnny brought the doughnuts, Steve brings in the bagels, Susan griping about not having her coffee yet, etc. etc.. The shift passes without anything eventful taking place, but I just can’t shake the image of my wife’s ass. It’s playing at me as I file away paperwork, taunting me as I click away on the keyboard. 

I fire off an email to my boss telling him that the majority of the work is done for the day, and I’m going to head out early to take advantage of the nicer weather and get some much needed yard work done. I’m in Massachusetts and the past weekend was forecasted to be almost 70 degrees. He responds almost immediately with an ok and I’m out the door.

I got home just after 12pm, and notice my wife’s car still here. Not knowing why she was still home, I walked in and she wasn’t anywhere in the main of the house. I walk into our bedroom and there she was, laying on the bed, and there her ass was. Taunting me. Teasing me. Almost as if to say “like the view?” Her positioning was what really pushed me over the edge. She was laying on her stomach, her left leg was straightened out and her right leg was hiked up a bit, with a bent knee, and her ass was perfectly poised in its plumpness. I asked her what she was doing still home, turns out she was called by her employer saying they overstaffed for the day and she didn’t need to come in. Since there was no need to get out of bed, there was no need for clothes.

This is part 1 of the FU. I’ll spare you the boring details, I don’t want to end up on r/ihavesex anyway. Suffice it to say, we did the deed. Having both enjoyed ourselves immensely, and having got exactly what I wanted since the moment I woke up, we decided to share a shower for some additional closeness and spend the rest of the afternoon together. 

Part 2 of the FU is when we were showering, we turned the water temp up way too high. Like almost burning the skin, in an effort to feel “clean and refreshed”. I washed my bits thoroughly, and stepped out to dry off, leaving her to enjoy the water awhile longer. 

Part 3 and the final part of the FU: After drying off, I noticed an itching sensation on and about my penis. My thinking was “perhaps the water was too hot, got some dry skin” I look around for the Gold Bond anti itch powder with the idea of putting just enough to take the edge off. I’m not trying to look like I’m carrying a colonial’s powdered wig in my pants. I distinctly remember noticing the powder bottle as unusually green instead of its normal golden yellow, but thought nothing of it because it said right on it “anti-itch”. I dump out a bit too much, but it’s powder, it’s not like it’s going to waste. I proceed to toss my penis and balls like I’m working behind the counter in that KFC commercial and I’m breading the chicken. Coating every nook and crevice in the whiteness. I pull my boxers on, begin to throw a t-shirt on, and then I feel it.

This odd sensation is beginning to develop on my recently powdered manhood. I stupidly ask my wife still in the shower “Has this powder gone bad? Can powder go bad?” She asks which powder I used, I said “The Gold Bond, but green”  she responds something akin to “I used that last night for my feet, I poured it into my socks to help with the itch. It’s not foot powder, but it cools down the rash”. Suddenly I feel the sensation intensify, the feeling of “cool” is an understatement. My manhood is burning in an eruption of icy flame. A conflagration of cold has gripped my dick and balls like a Yeti and I can feel my little swimmers freezing to death. 

I tried, I really tried to tough it out. I reread the bottle and in smallish letters it says “Menthol” I thought I could withstand the surprise blizzard in my pants. And for a good few minutes I did. But it just kept intensifying. Every passing second brought me closer and closer to the unforgiving temperatures of the deep Antarctic ice. Until I could withstand it no longer. I leapt back into the shower, and focused the entire output of the shower head onto my icicle. My wife, doubled over with laughter at the floor of the shower.

I grew up never washing my bellybutton, I would just shower without even thinking about it. Throughout the years I would sometimes stick a finger in it to make sure everything was fine, I would always feel a rough texture inside, but my dumbass thought that was just dry blood from when they cut my umbilical cord, (I know it's stupid, but I was a child.) so I would just ignore it.

When I was around 14 or 15 out of nowhere I realized I had never washed my bellybutton properly for years, I didn't think it was a big deal, so I thought I'd just wash it off and move on with my day. I put my finger inside of it and felt the roughness again, it had gotten worse and it was painful when I touched it, so I realized that obviously wasn't supposed to be there. Although it was painful, I scratched that rough part until something fell off and I caught it with my other hand. It was something black, hard as rock. It was just pure dirtness stuck in my bellybutton that pilled up in there for years.

It was painful. That thing was stuck to my skin and I had to rip it off of it. I put my finger in it again to make sure I wasn't bleeding, I wasn't, but I could still feel all the dirt inside my bellybutton. I knew I had to get that out of it, so I just bared the pain and scratched it all off. That thing was really deep in there.

It was an extremely painful process but I managed to get it all off, I did end up bleeding but it wasn't much so I just let it heal by itself. My bellybutton was in pain for almost a week, but it was worth it to get all that dirt out of me.

People, please wash your bellybuttons.

TL,DR: Didn't wash my bellybutton for years, when I finally did, I had to scratch off dirt from it, which led me to bleeding and being in pain for a week.",TIFU by not washing my bellybutton
600,tifu,"Needless to say, this is a throwaway account.

Short background:

I am 20 yrs old girl, having a boyfriend for almost a year.
I come from a religious jewish family, where it is forbidden to have sex before marriage.
I became a non-believer a few yrs ago.

This happened today. My boyfriend came back from a trip of above a week. I met him today and knew there will be.. Umm.. Some action. 
Dressed up with my sexy lingerie.

A few hours before the meeting, I noticed I am on my period. Sucks. God hates me. In the Jewish religion, having heterosexual sex while the woman is having a period is a VERY big sin. Some Rabbi even say the couple shouldn't touch each other so they won't end up sleeping while the woman is bleeding.

Meanings, that having sex while on period + before marriage is a very, very big no-no. It means gross and forbidden. Going to hell and all of these things. 

I go to my room and notice I'm out of tampons. OK, no problem. I go to my mom and get some. Everything seems OK. 

Anyways, I come back home after visiting my boyfriend. I wear black long pants and a pink, shiny lace panties beneath. 

I greet my dad. He doesn't ask a lot about how was the meeting. Pretty weird, I think. But maybe he guessed what we've done together and wanted to give me privacy.
I go to my room to change my clothes when my mom calls me to come to her. Here's my mistake. I'll regret forever for not changing my damn clothes.
I came to her and she asked how it was. My little brother is sitting next to her. I tell her it was nice to see him and bla bla.
She looks at my pants and I says ""you forgot to zip your trousers"".
I look down.

To my horror, I forgot completely to zip my pants. There was a single button that was closed, but the zipper was entirely open, exposing my shiny, pink lingerie beneath. It was even more shiny because I stood below the light.

My mom was horrified. She said that having sex while on period is unforgiven. That it's gross and that even non-religious people don't so that. She started to tell me about how it's unhealthy and it's like having sex when there's an open wound down there.
I try to tell her it's not like that, but she doesn't believe me.
To add to my disgrace, my little brother was also there. He was speechless.

Well, I don't know how I could look her in the eyes again. Or my dad's. Or my brother's. I guess I gotta tell my boyfriend that he won't come to my house this week.

TL;DR : I came back home from meeting my boyfriend with zipper open, exposing my sexy lingerie to my religious mom, dad and little brother while on period. Can't look them in the eyes again.

For demonstration, here's a picture of a panties similar to what I had:

601,tifu,"The obligatory this happened a few years back but I’ve just been reminded of this incident, TL;DR at bottom

When I was at college studying a degree I always tried to arrive early to get a free parking spot outside one of the college buildings.  After lectures for the day we’re done around lunchtime I headed back to my car to find that some inconsiderate ass had parked behind me blocked me in and as there were cars parked (legally) beside me and a fence on the other side, I was stuck!

Now I can be an ass at the best of times but I was stuck there waiting for over an hour before the cars beside me moved so I could leave.  The asshole who parked behind me was nowhere to be found! I wasn’t amused!

In an effort to get free one thing I did was called the police on their non emergency number - they can usually give them a call and get them to move.

The registration for this car began YP54 and me being a Yorkshire born and bred lass, I have a very dodgy accent N’s can sound like M’s etc so on occasions like this I prefer to use the phonetic alphabet.

The problem however was that as I was about to say “Yankee papa” I just so glanced at a car with a registration starting with a “W”.

I proceeded to tell the police officer the registration was “wankey papa”

I was mortified however the police officer found it hilarious!

TL;DR got blocked in and confused the phonetic alphabet, told the police the registration was “wankey papa”",TIFU by mixing up the phonetic alphabet

603,tifu,"Obligatory: This didn’t happen today, rather 10 years ago. Buckle up for this one 

It was June of 2010. My attention span was short, my glasses were thick, and my hormones were raging. I had just turned 14 years old and was gifted my first cellphone, the LG Octane. The innovative design of the Octane excited me, and as I was navigating its tens of features, I discovered what hitting the up arrow prompted. 

It opened the internet, and that was a big deal to me considering I didn’t have WiFi at my house. I now had a seemingly endless wealth of knowledge and information at my fingertips, and the first thing I typed into the search bar with my grimy fingertips was  *www.pornhub.com* 

Up until now, my only resources for jerking off were magazines and my imagination, so this phone was game changer. I had heard of this mythical website before by word-of-mouth, and had watched porn at friend’s houses in the past, so I was ready to see what all the fuss was about regarding this website. 

*Holy fucking shit.* I had just discovered the expansive and exciting world of internet pornography, and I was hooked. The next 4 weeks were 28 consecutive field days of watching new categories, researching new porn stars, and beating my meat like I was preparing to host a Fourth of July BBQ. Looking back, the titties looked like they belonged in the 1996 version of Tomb Raider, but I didn’t care. The Octane’s  2.6” screen transmitted the most beautiful, low-resolution women I had ever seen. All was well until one fateful morning...

My dad woke me up at 7 am demanding to know why my phone bill was over $800. Well my friends, that is because I had never heard of the term “cellular data.” While I was caught up in watching internet porn, I was simultaneously racking up one hell of a phone bill. I tripped over my words while telling my dad I was just watching YouTube videos, but he didn’t exercise any sympathy. He was the most irate I had ever seen him, and he not only took my phone away, but also told me I would do chores until I paid off my phone bill (took 2 years btw). I definitely got off easy that day considering my dads temper, and I also learned a valuable lesson. I learned that no internet porn is worth $800, or my father’s wrath. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR: watched $800 worth of porn on my flip phone without knowing what “cellular data” was",TIFU by watching $800 worth of porn
640,tifu,"So this FU stems back a few months, also throwaway because this is embarrassing. My wife and I switched up some chores when we moved this past July, and she elected to start washing towels and folding them. After about a week, she confronted me about my towel usage. I’ve always used two large towels after I shower, one for my face and hair, and another for my asshole, frank n beans, and body. She found this unacceptable and told me I either need to start using a smaller hand towel for my head, or use “towel turbies” (as she calls them) like she does for her face and hair. 

I couldn’t get used to using a smaller towel for my face and hair. I don’t know why, but I just like being able to wrap the whole towel around my head for a quick moment. So I started using her towel for my head. I can accept her ass/vag particles on my face since I already have my face down there regularly, but I just can’t accept my own for some reason (y am I like this).

She was on her period today though, and she must have not noticed a blob of blood got on the towel because she hung it back up (probably an easy mistake as our towels are dark purple). I did not notice the spot either until I was wiping my nose and I felt something gooey run across it. I made sure my nose wasn’t bleeding, but I didn’t need to because I deep down I knew what I had just done. I think I’m going to take back the chore of washing towels so she doesn’t notice how many I go through. 

TLDR: I’ve been secretly using my wife’s towel to dry my head off after I shower, she was on her period today and must have not noticed blood got on the towel, but I sure did when I smeared it across my nose.",TIFU by using my wife’s towel.
